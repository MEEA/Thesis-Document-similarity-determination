  "textBody" : "The People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison is the defence force stationed in Macau since December 20, 1999. It has been the responsibility of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), which stations between 500-600 troops in Macau, primarily as a symbolic presence to underscore Chinese sovereignty.\n\nThe remainder of the 1,200-strong Macau garrison resides just across the Chinese border in Zhuhai. Although the Basic Law states that the Macau SAR government may \"when necessary\" ask the central government to allow the garrison to assist in maintaining public order or disaster relief, Chief Executive Ho has said that, in keeping with the Basic Law the garrison will play no role in internal security. The garrison has maintained a low profile, with soldiers generally wearing civilian clothing when off base and not engaging in business activities. \n\nMission\n\nAccording to the Law on Stationing Troops in the Macau Special Administrative Region (or Macau Garrison Law, passed by the NPC Standing Committee on June 28, 1999), the mission of the PLA in Macau is to defend the special administrative region by \"preventing and resisting aggression; safe-guarding the security of Macau; undertaking defence services; managing military facilities; and handling related foreign military affairs.\" The PLA can also be called upon by the chief executive to help maintain public order and assist with disaster relief efforts. The members of the garrison are mainly ground force troops.\n\n2017 Typhoon Hato\n\nAt the request of Macau SAR Government, the PLA Macau Garrison was deployed to assist in disaster relief and cleaning up in the aftermath of Typhoon Hato in August 2017, the first time for domestic affairs in Macau history. About 1,000 troops were called in to help remove debris and clear roads.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe PLA Macau Garrison is under the command and control of the Central Military Commission, and its budget is administered by the central government in Beijing. A PLA major general heads the Macau Garrison.\n\nTroops\n\n* 1 motorised infantry\n* 1 armored company\n\nEquipment\n\nBases\n\nThe garrison was temporarily stationed at the 11 storey Edificação Long Cheng/Long Cheng Mansion. It is now stationed on Taipa Island located amongst the new casinos in Cotai Strip (Estrada da Baía de Nossa Sra. da Esperança across from Hotel Venetian and Galaxy Macau). \n\nThere are more troops at the barracks in Zhuhai (Zhengling).",
