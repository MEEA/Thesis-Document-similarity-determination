It was then known as \"Davisville\", named after Jerome C. Davis, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name simply to \"Davis\" in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated on March 28, 1917.[http://daviswiki.org/Jerome_C._Davis Jerome C. Davis]\n\nFrom its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California's University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908.[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/overview.html Davis: Historical Overview] University of California History Retrieved on 02-17-08 The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.\n\nGeography and environment\n\nLocation\n\nDavis is located in Yolo County, California, 18 km west of Sacramento, 113 km northeast of San Francisco, 619 km north of Los Angeles, at the intersection of Interstate 80 and State Route 113. Neighboring towns include Dixon, Winters, and Woodland.\n\nDavis lies in the Sacramento Valley, the northern portion of the Central San Joaquin Valley, in Northern California, at an elevation of about 16 m (52 ft) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it (0.19%) is water.\n\nThe topography is flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for bicyclists.[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/03/davis-california-the-american-city-which-fell-in-love-with-the-bicycle][https://www.wired.com/2010/05/league-american-bicyclists-bicycle-friendly-community-awards/]\n\nClimate \n\nThe Davis climate resembles that of nearby Sacramento and is typical of California's Central Valley Mediterranean climate regime: dry, hot summers and cool, rainy, winters. It is classified as a Köppen Csa climate. Average temperatures range from 46 °F in December and January to 75 °F in July and August. Thick ground fog called tule fog settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense with visibility to nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.\n\nRecord temperatures range from a high of 116 °F on July 17, 1925, to a low of 12 °F on December 11, 1932.\n\nNeighborhoods\n\nDavis is internally divided by two freeways (Interstate 80 and State Route 113), a north–south railroad (California Northern), an east-west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets. The city is unofficially divided into six main districts made up of smaller neighborhoods (often originally named as housing subdivisions):\n\n* Central Davis, north of Fifth Street and Russell Boulevard, south of Covell Blvd., east of SR 113, and west of the railroad tracks running along G Street. Within these boundaries is the officially denoted neighborhood of Old North Davis, which is sometimes also considered part of Downtown.\n* Downtown Davis, roughly the numbered-and-lettered grid north of I-80, south of Fifth Street, east of A Street, and west of the railroad tracks, including the Aggie Village and Olive Drive areas. \n* East Davis, north of I-80, south of Covell Blvd., and east of the railroad tracks. It includes the older, 'inner' East Davis of lettered streets and neighborhoods such as Davis Manor, Chestnut, and Rancho Yolo, as well as more distinctly identified (in some cases walled-in) subdivisions such as Mace Ranch, Lake Alhambra Estates, and Wildhorse. \n* North Davis, north of Covell Blvd. North Davis includes Covell Park, Senda Nueva, Northstar, and North Davis Farms.\n* South Davis, south of I-80, and includes Willowbank. El Macero, California, although outside the city limits, is sometimes considered part of South Davis; El Macero is part of the Davis Joint Unified School District, and El Macero children who attend public schools attend Davis' public schools. \n* West Davis, north of I-80 and west of SR 113. West Davis includes Westwood, Evergreen, Aspen, Stonegate (west of Lake Boulevard and including Stonegate Lake and the Stonegate Country Club) and the eco-friendly Village Homes development, known for its solar-powered houses. \n\nThe University of California, Davis is located south of Russell Boulevard and west of A Street and then south of 1st Street. The land occupied by the university is not incorporated within the boundaries of the city of Davis and lies within both Yolo and Solano Counties.\n\nEnvironment \n\nLocal energy planning began in Davis after the energy crisis of 1973. A new building code promoted energy efficiency. Energy use in buildings decreased dramatically and in 1981 Davis citizens won a $100, 000 prize from utility PG&E, for cutting electricity use during the summer peak.Lovins on the Soft Path: A Guide to the Film, RMI, 1985.\n\nOn November 14, 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.[http://daviswiki.org/Nuclear_Free_Zone Nuclear Free Zone – Davis Wiki] In 1998, the City passed a 'Dark Skies' ordinance in an effort to reduce light pollution in the night sky.McCarthy, E.[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/1999/02/01/focus3.html?page=all \"'Dark skies' law casts new light on buildings\"] Sacramento Business Journal, 31 Jan. 1999.\n\nDemographics\n\nDavis is part of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n2010\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Davis had a population of 65,622.

Davis has the world's largest English-language local wiki, DavisWiki.\n\nToad Tunnel \n\nDavis' Toad Tunnel is a wildlife crossing that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21 inches (53 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) high.\n\nThe tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground. The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of California\n\nThe University of California, Davis, or UC Davis, a campus of the University of California, had a 2015 Fall enrollment of 36,104 students.[http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance] UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.\n\nD-Q University\n\nAlso known as Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University and much smaller than UC Davis, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in Yolo County 6.7 miles (11 km) west of State Route 113. This is just west of Davis near the Yolo County Airport. About four miles (6 km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from Interstate 505 is marked with cryptic signage, \"DQU.\" The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). NAD83 coordinates for the campus are \n\nThe college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional American Indian ceremonies. The 643 acre and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a National Park Service publication, Five Views. The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as D-Q University. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.\n\nOther colleges\n\nAn off-campus branch of Sacramento City College is located in Davis.\n\nPublic schools\n\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the Davis Joint Unified School District.\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for independent study (Davis School for Independent Study), three public junior high schools (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Frances Harper), one main high school (Davis Senior High School), one alternative high school (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school (Leonardo da Vinci High School). Cesar Chavez is a Spanish immersion school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool.\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. César Chávez served grades K–3 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4–6 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K–6 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K–6.\n\nPrivate schools\n\n* Peregrine School (Preschool and Elementary)\n* Merryhill School (K–8)\n* Saint James School (K–8)\n* Grace Valley Christian Academy (K–9)\n* Davis Waldorf School (Pre-K–8)\n\nNotable natives and residents\n\nThese are some notable Davis residents, other than UC Davis faculty who were not previously from Davis.\n\n* Karin Argoud, actress\n* Samuel G.

It was then known as \"Davisville\", named after Jerome C. Davis, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name simply to \"Davis\" in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated on March 28, 1917.[http://daviswiki.org/Jerome_C._Davis Jerome C. Davis]\n\nFrom its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California's University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908.[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/overview.html Davis: Historical Overview] University of California History Retrieved on 02-17-08 The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.\n\nGeography and environment\n\nLocation\n\nDavis is located in Yolo County, California, 18 km west of Sacramento, 113 km northeast of San Francisco, 619 km north of Los Angeles, at the intersection of Interstate 80 and State Route 113. Neighboring towns include Dixon, Winters, and Woodland.\n\nDavis lies in the Sacramento Valley, the northern portion of the Central San Joaquin Valley, in Northern California, at an elevation of about 16 m (52 ft) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it (0.19%) is water.\n\nThe topography is flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for bicyclists.[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/03/davis-california-the-american-city-which-fell-in-love-with-the-bicycle][https://www.wired.com/2010/05/league-american-bicyclists-bicycle-friendly-community-awards/]\n\nClimate \n\nThe Davis climate resembles that of nearby Sacramento and is typical of California's Central Valley Mediterranean climate regime: dry, hot summers and cool, rainy, winters. It is classified as a Köppen Csa climate. Average temperatures range from 46 °F in December and January to 75 °F in July and August. Thick ground fog called tule fog settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense with visibility to nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.\n\nRecord temperatures range from a high of 116 °F on July 17, 1925, to a low of 12 °F on December 11, 1932.\n\nNeighborhoods\n\nDavis is internally divided by two freeways (Interstate 80 and State Route 113), a north–south railroad (California Northern), an east-west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets. The city is unofficially divided into six main districts made up of smaller neighborhoods (often originally named as housing subdivisions):\n\n* Central Davis, north of Fifth Street and Russell Boulevard, south of Covell Blvd., east of SR 113, and west of the railroad tracks running along G Street. Within these boundaries is the officially denoted neighborhood of Old North Davis, which is sometimes also considered part of Downtown.\n* Downtown Davis, roughly the numbered-and-lettered grid north of I-80, south of Fifth Street, east of A Street, and west of the railroad tracks, including the Aggie Village and Olive Drive areas. \n* East Davis, north of I-80, south of Covell Blvd., and east of the railroad tracks. It includes the older, 'inner' East Davis of lettered streets and neighborhoods such as Davis Manor, Chestnut, and Rancho Yolo, as well as more distinctly identified (in some cases walled-in) subdivisions such as Mace Ranch, Lake Alhambra Estates, and Wildhorse. \n* North Davis, north of Covell Blvd. North Davis includes Covell Park, Senda Nueva, Northstar, and North Davis Farms.\n* South Davis, south of I-80, and includes Willowbank. El Macero, California, although outside the city limits, is sometimes considered part of South Davis; El Macero is part of the Davis Joint Unified School District, and El Macero children who attend public schools attend Davis' public schools. \n* West Davis, north of I-80 and west of SR 113. West Davis includes Westwood, Evergreen, Aspen, Stonegate (west of Lake Boulevard and including Stonegate Lake and the Stonegate Country Club) and the eco-friendly Village Homes development, known for its solar-powered houses. \n\nThe University of California, Davis is located south of Russell Boulevard and west of A Street and then south of 1st Street. The land occupied by the university is not incorporated within the boundaries of the city of Davis and lies within both Yolo and Solano Counties.\n\nEnvironment \n\nLocal energy planning began in Davis after the energy crisis of 1973. A new building code promoted energy efficiency. Energy use in buildings decreased dramatically and in 1981 Davis citizens won a $100, 000 prize from utility PG&E, for cutting electricity use during the summer peak.Lovins on the Soft Path: A Guide to the Film, RMI, 1985.\n\nOn November 14, 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.[http://daviswiki.org/Nuclear_Free_Zone Nuclear Free Zone – Davis Wiki] In 1998, the City passed a 'Dark Skies' ordinance in an effort to reduce light pollution in the night sky.McCarthy, E.[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/1999/02/01/focus3.html?page=all \"'Dark skies' law casts new light on buildings\"] Sacramento Business Journal, 31 Jan. 1999.\n\nDemographics\n\nDavis is part of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n2010\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Davis had a population of 65,622.

Plants from all over the world grow in different sections of the park. There are notable oak and native plant collections and a small redwood grove. A small waterway spans the arboretum along the bed of the old North Fork of Putah Creek. Occasionally herons, kingfishers, and cormorants can be seen around the waterways, as well as the ever-present ducks. Tours of the arboretum led by volunteer naturalists are often held for grade-school children.\n\nThe Domes \n\nThe Domes, (AKA Baggins End Innovative Housing), is an on-campus cooperative housing community designed by project manager Ron Swenson and future student-residents in 1972. Consisting of 14 polyurethane foam-insulated fiberglass domes and located in the Sustainable Research Area at the western end of Orchard Road, it is governed by its 26 UCD student residents. It is one of the few student co-housing cooperative communities in the USA, and is an early example of the modern-day growing tiny house movement. The community has successfully resisted several threats to its continuation over the years.\n\nFarmers Market\n\nThe Davis Farmers Market[http://www.davisfarmersmarket.org/ davisfarmersmarket.org] is held every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. Participants sell a range of fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy and meat products (often from certified organic farms), crafts, and plants and flowers.

Davis has two community radio stations: KDVS 90.3 FM, on the University of California campus, and KDRT 95.7 FM, a subsidiary of Davis Media Access and one of the first low-power FM radio stations in the United States. Davis has the world's largest English-language local wiki, DavisWiki.\n\nToad Tunnel \n\nDavis' Toad Tunnel is a wildlife crossing that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21 inches (53 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) high.\n\nThe tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground. The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of California\n\nThe University of California, Davis, or UC Davis, a campus of the University of California, had a 2015 Fall enrollment of 36,104 students.[http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance] UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.\n\nD-Q University\n\nAlso known as Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University and much smaller than UC Davis, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in Yolo County 6.7 miles (11 km) west of State Route 113. This is just west of Davis near the Yolo County Airport. About four miles (6 km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from Interstate 505 is marked with cryptic signage, \"DQU.\" The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). NAD83 coordinates for the campus are \n\nThe college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional American Indian ceremonies. The 643 acre and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a National Park Service publication, Five Views. The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as D-Q University. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.\n\nOther colleges\n\nAn off-campus branch of Sacramento City College is located in Davis.\n\nPublic schools\n\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the Davis Joint Unified School District.\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for independent study (Davis School for Independent Study), three public junior high schools (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Frances Harper), one main high school (Davis Senior High School), one alternative high school (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school (Leonardo da Vinci High School). Cesar Chavez is a Spanish immersion school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool.\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis.
