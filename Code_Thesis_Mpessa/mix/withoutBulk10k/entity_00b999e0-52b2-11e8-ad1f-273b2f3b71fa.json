Período 2008-2020]  consist primarily of Mestizos, Amerindians, and people of European descent. The population is divided almost evenly between rural and urban areas.  \nAbout 65% of the population speak Spanish, with nearly all the rest speaking Amerindian languages (there are 23 officially recognized Amerindian languages).\n\nAccording to official 2012 national statistics, 39.8% of the population is indigenous.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to  the total population estimate was  in . The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.5%, 54.1% were aged between 15 and 65 years of age, and 4.4% were aged 65 years or older.\n\nGuatemala City, the largest city in Central America, is home to over 3 million inhabitants. In 1900 Guatemala had a population of 885,000.\n\n \nOver the twentieth century Guatemala's population grew by a factor of fourteen. Even though Guatemala's population grew by a factor of 14, it still wasn't the biggest jump in that region. Although Guatemala does have an increase in population, the annual population isn't the superior in that region of the world as well.\n\nPopulation by departments\n\nEmigration\n\nThe Guatemalan civil war from 1960 to 1996 provoked migration of Guatemalans, with a large majority of those leaving for foreign countries living in the United States. According to the International Organization for Migration, the total number of emigrants increased  from 6,700 in the 1960s to 558,776 for the period 1995-2000, by 2005 the total number had reached 1.3 million.[http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/guatemala-economic-migrants-replace-political-refugees Economic Migrants Replace Political Refugees] see Table 1. Emigration Flows from Guatemala,\n1960s through 2005. Retrieved on, 18 November 2014 In 2013, the MPI estimated that there  are around 900,000 people of Guatemalan origin in the United States.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nOfficial 2012 statistics indicate that approximately 60.2% of the population is \"non-indigenous\", referring to the mestizo population and the people of European origin. These people are called Ladino in Guatemala.\n\nApproximately 39.8% of the population is indigenous and consist of 23 Maya groups and one non-Maya group. These are divided as follows: (K'iche 9.1%, 8.4% Kaqchikel, Mam 7.9%, 6.3% Q'eqchi', other Maya peoples 8.6%, 0.2% indigenous non-Maya). They live all over the country, especially in the highlands.\n\nOther racial groups include numbers of Afro-Guatemalans, Afro-Mestizos, and Garifuna of mixed African and indigenous Caribbean origins who live in the country's eastern end. Some Garifunas live mainly in Livingston, San Vicente and Puerto Barrios. They descend mainly from the Arawaks and Belizean Creoles.\n\nThere are thousands of Arab Guatemalans descending from; Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and other Arab countries who reside in Guatemala City. Some belong to Christian Churches while others to Islamic Mosques.\n\nThere are also thousands of Jews residing in Guatemala. They are immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe that arrived in the 19th century. Many immigrated during World War II. There are approximately 9,000 Jews living in Guatemala today. Most live in Guatemala City, Quezaltenango and San Marcos. Today, the Jewish community in Guatemala is made up of Orthodox Jews, Sephardi, Eastern European and German Jews.\n\nIn 2014, numerous members of the Hassidic communities Lev Tahor and Toiras Jesed began settling in the village of San Juan La Laguna. The mainstream Jewish community was reportedly dismayed and concerned that the arrival of communities with a more visible adherence to Judaism might stir up anti-Jewish sentiment. Despite the tropical heat, the members of the community continued to wear the traditional ancient Jewish clothing.\n\nAsian Guatemalans are primarily of Korean descent and Chinese descent, whose ancestors were farm workers and railroad laborers in the early 20th century.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 1893 Guatemalan Census reported that 481,945 persons, or 35.3% of the population, were Ladinos (defined as both whites and people of European and Indian descent), and 882,733 persons, or 64.7% of the population,  were Natives.\n\nEuropean Guatemalans\n\nApproximately, 18.5% of the population is considered White or Caucasian, accounts for more than 3 million of the population. Most are of German and Spanish descent, but there is a considerable number of people of Italian, Belgian, French, British, Swiss, Finnish, Russian and Hungarian descent.\n\nThe departments of Zacapa and Chiquimula are half or predominantly of Spanish descent, with castizos, the white populations make up more than 80% in these departments, where many European immigrants arrived, mainly the 19th and 20th centuries. In Guatemala City there is a significant amount of minority descendants of Europeans (35-40%), and other minorities with more than 20%  in Coban, Carlos V and Xelaju.\n\nMestizo Guatemalans\n\nGuatemalan Mestizos are people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry. The Mestizo population is heavily populated in urban areas of the country (the national capital and departmental capitals).\n\nHistorically, the Mestizo population in the Kingdom of Guatemala at the time of Independence amounted to nearly 600,000 Indians, 300,000 Castes (mostly Mestizos and a lesser number of Mulattos), and 45,000 Criollos or Spanish, with a very small number of Spaniards.\n\nIndigenous Guatemalans\n\nThe Amerindian populations in Guatemala include the K'iche' 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9% and Q'eqchi 6.3%. 8.6% belongs to other Maya groups, 0.4% belong to non-Maya indigenous peoples. The whole indigenous community in Guatemala is about 40.5% of the population.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe official language of Guatemala is Spanish. It is spoken by more than 60% of the population and is found mainly in the departments of the Southern region, Eastern region, Guatemala City and Peten. Though the official language is Spanish, it is often the second language among the indigenous population.\n\nApproximately 23 additional Amerindian languages are spoken by more than  40%  of the population. The most significant are; Quiche, Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Garifuna and Xinca.\n\nThere are also significant numbers of German, Chinese, French and English speakers.\n\nReligion\n\nCatholicism was the official religion during the colonial era. Protestantism has increased in recent decades. More than one third of Guatemalans are Protestant, chiefly Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy claim rapid growth, especially among indigenous Mayans.\n\nThe Islamic community in Guatemala is growing, Muslim population of Guatemala is approximately 1,200. Of this population, 95% are Palestinian Arab immigrants. There is a mosque in the outskirts of Guatemala City called the Islamic Da'wah Mosque of Guatemala (Spanish: Mezquita de Aldawaa Islámica) which is available for the five daily prayers and offers classes in Islamic studies.\n\nThe president of the Islamic Community of the country is Jamal Mubarak.\n\nTraditionally a large proportion of Guatemalans have been Catholics. This has declined, from 90% of the population in 1950, 61% in 1986, 65% in 1991 (after the visit of the Pope John Paul II), 57% in 2006, and 47% in 2013. Between 1882 and 1940, 2% of the population were Protestants, 17.98% were Protestant in 1978, 30% in 1986, 21% in 1991, 25.27% in 2001, 30.70% in 2006[http://www.concejoecumenico.org/documentos/2010/Crecimiento_de_Iglesias_evangelicas_en_guatemala.pdf El crecimiento de las Iglesias Evangélicas en Guatemala: Una mirada Socio-religiosa] Guatemala, November 2010 and 40% Protestant in 2014.\n\n3% of Guatemalans follow other religions. 9% are non-religious. Guatemalans who self-identify as atheists/agnostics were 3.25% of the population in 1982, 12% in 1991, and 14.2% in 2001. According to the Latinobarómetro, 8% of the population were irreligious in 1996, 15% in 2000, 16% in 2007, 11% in 2008, 13% in 2010, with 10% irreligious in 2014.
