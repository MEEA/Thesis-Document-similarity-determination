  "textBody" : "In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.Hardy & Wright, § 5.1, p. 48  Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero.  However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.\n\nThe LCM is the \"lowest common denominator\" (LCD) that can be used before fractions can be added, subtracted or compared. The LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.\n\nOverview \n\nA multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and −2 as well.\n\nNotation \n\nIn this article we will denote the least common multiple of two integers a and b as lcm(a, b).\n\nSome older textbooks use [a, b].\n\nThe programming language J uses a*.b\n\nExample \n\nWhat is the LCM of 4 and 6?\n\nMultiples of 4 are:\n\n4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...\n\nand the multiples of 6 are:\n\n6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...\n\nCommon multiples of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:\n\n12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....\n\nSo, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers 4 and 6, their least common multiple is 12.\n\nApplications \n\nWhen adding, subtracting, or comparing vulgar fractions, it is useful to find the least common multiple of the denominators, often called the lowest common denominator, because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For instance,\n\n{2\\over21}+{1\\over6}{4\\over42}+{7\\over42}\n{11\\over42}\n\nwhere the denominator 42 was used because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.\n\nGears problem \n\nSuppose there are two meshing gears in a machine, having m and n teeth, respectively, and the gears are marked by a line segment drawn from the center of the first gear to the center of the second gear. When the gears begin rotating, we can determine how many rotations the first gear must complete to realign the line segment by making use of LCM(m, n). The first gear must complete LCM(m, n)/m rotations for the realignment. By that time, the second gear will have made LCM(m, n)/n rotations.\n\nPlanetary alignment\n\nSuppose there are three planets revolving around a star which take l, m and n units of time respectively to complete their orbits. Assume that l, m and n are integers. Assuming the planets started moving around the star after an initial linear alignment, all the planets attain a linear alignment again after LCM(l, m, n) units of time. At this time, the first, second and third planet will have completed LCM(l, m, n)/l, LCM(l, m, n)/m and LCM(l, m, n)/n orbits respectively around the star.\n\nComputing the least common multiple \n\nReduction by the greatest common divisor \n\nThe following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:\n\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}.\n\nThis formula is also valid when exactly one of a and b is 0, since gcd(a, 0) |a|. However, if both a and b are 0, this formula would cause division by zero; lcm(0, 0) \n 0 is a special case.\n\nThere are fast algorithms for computing the GCD that do not require the numbers to be factored, such as the Euclidean algorithm. To return to the example above,\n\n\\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\operatorname{gcd}(21,6)}\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\operatorname{gcd}(3,6)}\n{21\\cdot 6\\over 3}\n \\frac{126}{3} = 42.\n\nBecause gcd(a, b) is a divisor of both a and b, it is more efficient to compute the LCM by dividing before multiplying:\n\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\\left(",
