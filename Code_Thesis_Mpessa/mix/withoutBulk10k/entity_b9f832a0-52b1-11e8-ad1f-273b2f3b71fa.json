For simplicity this article uses ALGOL. is a family of imperative computer programming languages, originally developed in the mid-1950s, which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the ACM in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years.[http://calgo.acm.org/ Collected Algorithms of the ACM] Compressed archives of the algorithms.

It was also the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope. Moreover, it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the Algol 60 Report introduced Backus–Naur form, a principal formal grammar notation for language design.\n\nThere were three major specifications, named after the year they were first published:\n* ALGOL 58 – originally proposed to be called IAL, for International Algebraic Language.\n* ALGOL 60 – first implemented as X1 ALGOL 60 in mid-1960.

Additionally, ALGOL object code was a simple, compact, and stack-based instruction set architecture commonly used in teaching compiler construction and other high order languages (of which Algol is generally considered the first).\n\nHistory\n\nALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at ETH Zurich (cf. ALGOL 58). It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs periods) for different languages.\n\nALGOL was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than Burroughs Corporation. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.\n\nJohn Backus developed the Backus normal form method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by Peter Naur for ALGOL 60, and at Donald Knuth's suggestion renamed Backus–Naur form.\n\nPeter Naur: \"As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959.

Backus, Julien Green, Charles Katz, John McCarthy, Alan J. Perlis, and Joseph Henry Wegstein (from the USA).\nAlan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: \"The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.\"\n\nALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. Tony Hoare remarked: \"Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.\"[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf \"Hints on Programming Language Design\"], C.A.R. Hoare, December 1973. Page 27. (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to Edsger W. Dijkstra, also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 compiler.)  The Scheme programming language, a variant of Lisp that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording \"Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme\" for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.\n\nAlgol and programming language research\n\nAs Peter Landin noted, the language Algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the (call-by-name) lambda calculus. Perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to John C. Reynolds, and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity. Reynolds's idealized Algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call-by-name languages, to be contrasted with the global effects used by call-by-value languages such as ML. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with PCF and ML.Peter O'Hearn and Robert D. Tennent. 1996. Algol-Like Languages. Birkhauser Boston Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.\n\nIAL implementations timeline\n\nTo date there have been at least 70 augmentations, extensions, derivations and sublanguages of Algol 60.\n\nThe Burroughs dialects included special Bootstrapping dialects such as ESPOL and NEWP.  The latter is still used for Unisys MCP system software.\n\nProperties\n\nALGOL 60 as officially defined had no I/O facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of transput (input/output) facilities.\n\nALGOL 60 allowed for two evaluation strategies for parameter passing: the common call-by-value, and call-by-name. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to call-by-reference. For example, without specifying the parameters as value or reference, it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable., Section 7.5, and references therein Think of passing a pointer to swap(i, A[i]) in to a function. Now that every time swap is referenced, it is reevaluated. Say i :1 and A[i] :\n 2, so every time swap is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.\n\nCall-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting \"thunks\" that are used to implement it. Donald Knuth devised the \"man or boy test\" to separate compilers that correctly implemented \"recursion and non-local references.\" This test contains an example of call-by-name.\n\nALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by Adriaan van Wijngaarden and which bears his name. Van Wijngaarden grammars use a context-free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled \"semantics\" and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as ad hoc code attached to the formal language parser.\n\nExamples and portability issues\n\nCode sample comparisons\n\nALGOL 60\n\n(The way the bold text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' -- quotation marks included -- for integer.

For instance: ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬, ∨, ∧, ⊂, ≡, ␣ and ⏨.\n\n1961 September: ASCII – The ASCII character set, then in an early stage of development, had the \\ (Back slash) character added to it in order to support ALGOL's boolean operators /\\ and \\/.[http://www.bobbemer.com/BACSLASH.HTM How ASCII Got Its Backslash], Bob Bemer\n\n1962: ALCOR – This character set included the unusual \"᛭\"  (iron/runic crosshttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/16ed/index.htm) character and the \"⏨\" (Decimal Exponent Symbolhttp://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf) for floating point notation.\n\n1964: GOST – The 1964 Soviet standard GOST 10859 allowed the encoding of 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit and 7-bit characters in ALGOL.\n\n1968: The \"Algol 68 Report\" – used existing ALGOL characters, and further adopted →, ↓, ↑, □, ⌊, ⌈, ⎩, ⎧, ○, ⊥ and ¢ characters which can be found on the IBM 2741 keyboard with \"golf-ball\" print heads inserted (such as the APL golfball). These became available in the mid-1960s while ALGOL 68 was being drafted.  The report was translated into Russian, German, French and Bulgarian, and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets, e.g. Cyrillic alphabet of the Soviet BESM-4. All ALGOL's characters are also part of the Unicode standard and most of them are available in several popular fonts.\n\n2009 October: Unicode – The \"⏨\" (Decimal Exponent Symbol) for floating point notation was added to Unicode 5.2  for backward compatibility with historic Buran (spacecraft) ALGOL software.",

For instance: ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬, ∨, ∧, ⊂, ≡, ␣ and ⏨.\n\n1961 September: ASCII – The ASCII character set, then in an early stage of development, had the \\ (Back slash) character added to it in order to support ALGOL's boolean operators /\\ and \\/.[http://www.bobbemer.com/BACSLASH.HTM How ASCII Got Its Backslash], Bob Bemer\n\n1962: ALCOR – This character set included the unusual \"᛭\"  (iron/runic crosshttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/16ed/index.htm) character and the \"⏨\" (Decimal Exponent Symbolhttp://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf) for floating point notation.\n\n1964: GOST – The 1964 Soviet standard GOST 10859 allowed the encoding of 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit and 7-bit characters in ALGOL.\n\n1968: The \"Algol 68 Report\" – used existing ALGOL characters, and further adopted →, ↓, ↑, □, ⌊, ⌈, ⎩, ⎧, ○, ⊥ and ¢ characters which can be found on the IBM 2741 keyboard with \"golf-ball\" print heads inserted (such as the APL golfball). These became available in the mid-1960s while ALGOL 68 was being drafted.  The report was translated into Russian, German, French and Bulgarian, and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets, e.g. Cyrillic alphabet of the Soviet BESM-4. All ALGOL's characters are also part of the Unicode standard and most of them are available in several popular fonts.\n\n2009 October: Unicode – The \"⏨\" (Decimal Exponent Symbol) for floating point notation was added to Unicode 5.2  for backward compatibility with historic Buran (spacecraft) ALGOL software.
