He had an older brother, Michael (1942–2012), and a sister, Mary Jane Elizabeth. In 2006 Bryson published The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, a humorous account of his childhood years in Des Moines.\n\nBryson attended Drake University for two years before dropping out in 1972, deciding instead to backpack around Europe for four months. He returned to Europe the following year with a high-school friend, Matt Angerer (the pseudonymous Stephen Katz).https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/09/01/bill-brysons-stephen-katz/71494350/ Bryson wrote about some of his experiences from this trip in his book Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe.\n\nMove to the United Kingdom\n\nBryson first visited Britain in 1973 during his tour of Europehttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/14/bill-bryson-books-interview-follow-up-notes-from-a-small-island and decided to stay after landing a job working in a psychiatric hospital—the now-defunct Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey. He met a nurse there named Cynthia Billen, whom he married in 1975. They moved to Bryson's hometown of Des Moines, Iowa in 1975 so that Bryson could complete his college degree at Drake University. In 1977 they settled in Britain.\n\nHe worked as a journalist, first for the Bournemouth Evening Echo and eventually became chief copy editor of the business section of The Times and then deputy national news editor of the business section of The Independent.

During his time in the United States, Bryson decided to walk the Appalachian Trail with his friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonym), about which he wrote the book A Walk in the Woods.

The case was settled out of court, with part of the settlement being that Bryson not discuss it.The Road to Little Dribbling.\n\nAwards, positions and honours\n\nIn 2005 Bryson was appointed chancellor of Durham University, succeeding the late Sir Peter Ustinov, and became more active with student activities than is common for holders of that post, even appearing in a Durham student film and promoting litter picks in the city. He had praised Durham as \"a perfect little city\" in Notes from a Small Island. In October 2010, it was announced that Bryson would step down at the end of 2011.\n\nIn May 2007, he became the president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. His first area of focus in this role was the establishment of an anti-littering campaign across England. He discussed the future of the countryside with Richard Mabey, Sue Clifford, Nicholas Crane and Richard Girling at CPRE's Volunteer Conference in November 2007.https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/30/reviews/990530.30gleickt.html\n\nBryson has received numerous awards for his ability to communicate science with passion and enthusiasm.
