Hominy grits are a type of grits made from hominy (corn that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization) with the germ removed. Grits are often served with other flavorings as a breakfast dish, usually savory. Grits originated in the Southern United States but now are available nationwide. Grits are popular as a dinner entrée, shrimp and grits, served primarily in the Southern United States. Grits should not be confused with boiled ground corn, which makes \"hasty pudding\" or \"mush\" or when using coarse ground corn, which may be made into polenta, or the \"mush\" made from more finely ground corn meal.\n\nGrits are of Native American origin and are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta and mieliepap.  \nThe word \"grits\" is derived from the Old English word \"grytt,\" meaning coarse meal.\n\nOrigins \n\nTraditionally, the hominy for grits was ground on a stone mill. The ground hominy is then passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits.  Many American communities used a gristmill until the mid-twentieth century, farmers bringing their corn to be ground, and the miller keeping a portion as his fee. State law in South Carolina requires grits and rice meal to be enriched, similar to the requirement for flour, unless the grits were ground and returned to the grower by a miller who kept a portion as his fee.[http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t39c029.php South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 39 – Trade and Commerce, Chapter 29].
