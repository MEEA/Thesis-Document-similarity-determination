  "textBody" : "Consubstantiation is a Christian theological doctrine that (like Transubstantiation) describes the Real Presence  in the Eucharist. It holds that during the sacrament, the substance of the body and blood of Christ are present alongside the substance of the bread and wine, which remain present. \nIt was part of the doctrines of Lollardy and considered a heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nUse\n\nThe doctrine of consubstantiation is often held in contrast to the doctrine of transubstantiation. While some Lutherans use the term \"consubstantiation\" to describe their doctrine, many reject it as not accurately reflecting the eucharistic doctrine of Martin Luther, the sacramental union.F.L.

They reject the concept of consubstantiation because it replaces what they believe to be the biblical doctrine with a philosophical construct and because it implies that the body and blood are physically present in the same way as the bread and wine, rather than being present in an \"illocal\", supernatural way.J.T.
