Gilbert (1836–1911) and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900) and to the works they jointly created. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which H.M.S.

See Crowther (2011), p. 84 Over the next year, before the two first collaborated, Gilbert continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870) and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).\n\nSullivan before Gilbert\n\nSullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the Overture di Ballo, in 1870.[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/sullivan/interviews/lawrence.html \"An Illustrated Interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan, by Arthur H Lawrence, Part 1\"], The Strand Magazine, Volume xiv, No.84 (December 1897).

He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866).Shepherd, Marc, [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/sullorch.htm Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan: Orchestral and Band Music], The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 10 June 2007 These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901130842/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/sullivan2a.html Stephen Turnbull's Biography of W. S. Gilbert], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 22 November 2006\n\nSullivan's first foray into comic opera was Cox and Box (1866), written with librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine Fun) saying that Sullivan's score \"is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded.\"Harris, Roger, ed. (1999). Cox and Box. Chorleywood, Herts., UK: R. Clyde. pp. X–XI Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today. Sullivan and Burnand's second opera, The Contrabandista (1867) was not as successful.\n\nOperas\n\nFirst collaborations\n\nThespis\n\nIn 1871, producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, Thespis, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.Tillett, Selwyn and Spencer, Roderic. \"Forty Years of Thespis Scholarship\", text of talk delivered at the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival weekend, Cirencester, 21 September 2002.Jean-Bernard Piat: Guide du mélomane averti, Le Livre de Poche 8026, Paris 1992\n\nThespis opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,Walters, Michael. \"Thespis: a reply\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29. Summer 2011. but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.Williams, chapter 1 The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.\n\nOver the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on Happy Arcadia (1872) and with Alfred Cellier on Topsyturveydom (1874), and wrote The Wicked World (1873) Sweethearts (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his Festival Te Deum (1872); another oratorio, The Light of the World (1873); his only song cycle, The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens (1871); incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and hymns, including \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transportation; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.Jacobs, pp. 2–3Gillan, Don.

Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.Barker, John W. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515174236/http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html \"Gilbert and Sullivan\"], Madison Savoyards, Ltd., accessed 21 May 2007, quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of Trial by Jury to him: \"As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time.\"\n\nThe piece is one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since \"he is such a very bad lot,\" while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks \"substantial damages.\" After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of La Périchole. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/chap3.html Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment (Chapter 3)], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 May 2007\n\nFred Sullivan was the prototype for the \"patter\" (comic) baritone roles in the later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he \"was one of the most naturally comic little men I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest....\"Ayer p. 408 Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial comic little man role, as Burnand had put it. The \"patter\" baritone (or \"principal comedian\", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.\n\nAfter the success of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.Wachs, Kevin. [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/umgass/files/gasbag227.pdf \"Let’s vary piracee / With a little burglaree!\"], The Gasbag, Issue 227, Winter 2005, accessed 8 May 2012. Wachs concludes that much of the material from a draft of this opera later made its way into Act II of The Pirates of Penzance.\n\nEarly successes\n\nThe Sorcerer\n\nCarte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.\n\nGilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, \"The Elixir of Love,\" which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that The Sorcerer opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed Thespis.[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/index.html The Sorcerer], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 May 2007 While The Sorcerer won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of Trial by Jury. Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.\n\nH.M.S. Pinafore\n\nGilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.\n\nGilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in 'stagecraft', now called stage direction, by the playwrights James Planche and especially Tom Robertson. See Gilbert, W. S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/short_stories/stage_play.html A Stage Play]; and Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html Introduction]. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity.Cox-Ife, William. W. S. Gilbert: Stage Director. Dobson, 1978 . Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre.\"That Gilbert was a good director is not in doubt. He was able to extract from his actors natural, clear performances, which served the Gilbertian requirements of outrageousness delivered straight.\"[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1938719,00.html Mike Leigh interview]Baily, p. 335 As Jessie Bond wrote later:\n\nH.M.S.

The disgruntled former partners, who had invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers.Gillan, Don. [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-opcom.html \"The Assault on The Opera Comique\"], Stage Beauty, 2007, accessed 27 May 2009 This event cleared the way for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all of their succeeding operas.\n\nThe libretto of H.M.S. Pinafore relied on stock character types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.\n\nThe repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the \"respectability\" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits Pinafores theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the \"modern Major-General\" who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: \"resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!\"\n\nThe piece premiered in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright,Samuels, Edward.

Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.Ellmann, Richard Oscar Wilde, (Knopf, 1988) pp. 135 and 151–152  The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival \"aesthetic\" poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him. Richard D'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera's U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.\n\nDuring the run of Patience, Carte built the large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's permanent home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.See [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm this article on the Savoy Theatre], arthurlloyd.co.uk, accessed 20 July 2007.

The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in Iolanthe had taken a step forward. The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account Iolanthe his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\"Quoted in Allen 1975b, p. 176 Similarly, the Theatre asserted that \"the music of Iolanthe is Dr Sullivan's chef d'oeuvre.

These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planché, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.[http://www.bartleby.com/223/0815.html \"W.

Gilbert had referred to the new technology in Pinafore in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), heard a direct relay of parts of Iolanthe from the Savoy. This was probably the first live \"broadcast\" of an opera.Bradley (1996), p. 176\n\nDuring the run of Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera.Baily, p. 250 Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.\n\nPrincess Ida\n\nPrincess Ida (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.Stedman, pp. 200–01\n\nPrincess Ida was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after Ida opened, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\" As Princess Ida showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time.Jacobs, p. 187 In the meantime, when Ida closed, Carte produced a revival of The Sorcerer.\n\nDodging the magic lozenge\n\nThe Mikado\n\nThe most successful of the Savoy Operas was The Mikado (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters,Gilbert eventually found another opportunity to present his \"lozenge plot\" in The Mountebanks, written with Alfred Cellier in 1892 which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in \"human interest and probability\", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, The Sorcerer. As dramatised in the film Topsy-Turvy,albeit with the repetition of the apocryphal sword-falling story, see Jones, Brian (Spring 1985), \"The sword that never fell\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal 1 (1): 22–25 the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.\n\nThe story focuses on a \"cheap tailor,\" Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.\n\nWith the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, \"I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.\"[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/interviews/dlynws850121.html \"Workers and Their Work: Mr. W.S. Gilbert\"], Daily News, 21 January 1885, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012\n\nSetting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\"[http://pamphletpress.org/index.cfm?sec7&story_id\n69 Review of The Mikado], Pamphletpress.org, accessed 27 May 2009 G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: \"Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth.\"Dark and Grey, p. 101 Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including The Gondoliers, Utopia Limited, and The Grand Duke.\n\nThe Mikado became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre (surpassing the 571 performances of Pinafore and 576 of Patience) and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the operetta Les Cloches de Corneville, which held the title until Dorothy in 1886. See [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html this article on longest runs in the theatre up to 1920] The Mikado remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 37 It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.[http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm See here][http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm and here]\n\nRuddigore\n\nRuddigore (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian melodrama, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances. The original title, Ruddygore, together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics.[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/appeal.html See the Pall Mall Gazette's satire of Ruddygore.] Gilbert's response to being told the two spellings meant the same thing was: \"Not at all, for that would mean that if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don't.\" See [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/witter.htm this information from the Australian G&S site.] Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts.A copy of the Ruddigore libretto, including material cut before the first night and during the initial run, is   Nevertheless, the piece was profitable,[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/intro.html Information from the book Tit-Willow or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas] by Guy H. and Claude A. Walmisley (Privately Printed, Undated, early 20th century) and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, the Illustrated London News praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: \"Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.\"Perry, Helga. [http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/ruddigore/rud5.html Ruddygore], Illustrated London News, 9 January 1887, Savoyoperas.org.uk, accessed 27 May 2009 Further changes were made, including a new overture, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte revived Ruddigore after the First World War, and the piece was regularly performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.Critical apparatus in Hulme, David Russell, ed., Ruddigore. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2000)\n\nSome of the plot elements of Ruddigore were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits. When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the \"lozenge\" plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado.\n\nThe Yeomen of the Guard\n\nThe Yeomen of the Guard (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-early modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, Broken Hearts. The Times praised the libretto: \"It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things.\"Moratti, Mel. [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/yeomen.htm Yeomen, Homepages.ihug.co.nz, 5 March 2000, accessed 27 May 2009] Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, The Golden Legend, considered the score to Yeomen to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The Daily Telegraph wrote:\n\nYeomen was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,\n\nSullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as \"this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.\"Jacobs, p. 288\n\nThe Gondoliers\n\nThe Gondoliers (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of \"republican equality.\"[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/index.html The Gondoliers at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive], accessed 21 July 2007 Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the \"Stock Company Act\", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, Utopia Limited. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The Illustrated London News reported:\n\nSullivan's old collaborator on Cox and Box (later the editor of Punch magazine), F. C. Burnand, wrote to the composer: \"Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.\"Baily, p. 344 The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for H.M.S. Pinafore, Patience and The Mikado. There was a command performance of The Gondoliers for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. The Gondoliers was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.\n\nCarpet quarrel\n\nGilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.See, e.g., Stedman, pp. 254–56 and 323–24 and Ainger, pp. 193–94. In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with \"topsy-turvy\" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3 Also, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.See, e.g. Jacobs, p. 73; Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/life/long_bio.html The Life of W.S. Gilbert], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012; and Bond, Jessie. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/016.html The Reminiscences of Jessie Bond: Chapter 16], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012\n\nGilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.\n\nIn April 1890, however, during the run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.Ford, Tom. [http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/259962,gs-the-lennonmccartney-of-the-19th-century.aspx \"G&S: the Lennon/McCartney of the 19th century\"]. Limelight Magazine, Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011 Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\"Stedman, p. 270 As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:\n\nThings soon degraded, a legal hearing was held, and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell.Ainger, pp. 312–316 On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: \"The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived.\" Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.Shepherd, Marc. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/grand_duke/html/index.html \"Introduction: Historical Context\"], The Grand Duke, p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009. Linked at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 7 July 2009.\n\nGilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith,[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/gilbert/plays/plays_home.html Gilbert's Plays], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012 and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.Wolfson, p. 7\n\nLast works\n\nUtopia, Limited (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure.Wolfson, passim Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr.Wolfson, pp. 61–65 Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.\n\nAfter The Grand Duke, the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer. They did not speak to each other.Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sorcerer/programmes/1898_souvenir/so_1898.html \"The Sorcerer 21st Anniversary Souvenir\"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 8 October 2009, accessed 21 August 2012 Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been \"completely bridged over,\" and \"the most cordial relations existed between us.\"Walbrook, H. M. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap18.html \"The English Offenbach], Gilbert & Sullivan Opera: A History and a Comment, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 September 2003, accessed 27 May 2009 He stated that \"Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name.\"\n\nRichard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and his widow, Helen, continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works.Joseph, p. 146 Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 83 After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, Fallen Fairies (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.Baily, p. 425\n\nLegacy and assessment\n\nGilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, inherited the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances.Rollins and Witts, passimJoseph, passim The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere in Europe and around the world.Jellinek, Hedy and George.

K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas' success into the \"remote future\". He wrote that Gilbert's satire was \"too intelligent to be intelligible\" by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given \"wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words'] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it.\"Chesterton, G. K., introduction to Godwin, Augustine Henry. Gilbert & Sullivan: A Critical Appreciation of the Savoy Operas, E.P. Dutton & Co (1926) In 1957, a review in The Times gave this rationale for \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\":\n\nBecause of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a \"performing tradition\" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional.Bradley, Ian. Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan (2005) Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\"Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393 Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\".Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394 The National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities.Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 394–96 Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand.Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 398–99 In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960. The Savoy Company, an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia, continues to perform today.Fletcher, Juliet.

[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/miscover.htm Overtures,]  A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography (2005) Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided,[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/interviews/gazette.html \"Sir Arthur Sullivan\"], Interviewed by The Pall Mall Gazette, 5 December 1889, accessed 21 August 2012 and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections.Hughes, p. 130 Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.\n\nThose Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers and The Grand Duke. Sullivan's authorship of the overture to Utopia, Limited cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). Thespis is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture.Rees, Terence. Thespis - A Gilbert & Sullivan Enigma. London (1964): Dillon's University Bookshop, p. 79. Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's Henry the VIII, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke.Ainger, p. 140  Of those remaining, the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier,Ainger, pp. 157 and 177 the overture to Patience is by Eugene d'Albert,Ainger, at p. 195 writes, \"That evening (21 April 1881) Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene D'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student at the National Training School (where Sullivan was the principal and supervisor of the composition dept.) and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year.\" Several months before that, Sullivan had given d'Albert the task of preparing a piano reduction of The Martyr of Antioch for use in choral rehearsals of that 1880 work. David Russell Hulme studied the handwriting in the score's manuscript and confirmed that it is that of Eugen, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by Jacobs), both of whose script he sampled and compared to the Patience manuscript.

Yorks, Ref # DX171353, and Northern Illinois University, Call# :ML410.S95 H841986B. and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke (although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).Stone, David (2001), [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/ClarkeHamilton.htm \"Hamilton Clarke\",] Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 14 July 2008\n\nMost of the overtures are in three sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a concluding allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.\n\nIn the 1920s, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time, Geoffrey Toye, to write new overtures for Ruddigore and The Pirates of Penzance. Toye's Ruddigore overture entered the general repertory, and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke.Shepherd, Marc, [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/rud1924.htm The 1924 D'Oyly Carte Ruddigore], The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 14 July 2008 Toye's Pirates overture, however, did not last long and is now presumed lost.Shepherd, Marc.

This gave the Gondoliers overture the familiar fast-slow-fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures, and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan's original version.Hulme, David Russell.

In 1861, to supplement his income, the younger Gilbert began writing illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own, many of which would later be mined as inspiration for his plays and operas, particularly Gilbert's series of illustrated poems, the Bab Ballads.Stedman, pp. 26–29, 123–24, and the introduction to Gilbert's Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales\n\nIn the Bab Ballads and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique \"topsy-turvy\" style in which humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. Director and playwright Mike Leigh described the \"Gilbertian\" style as follows:\n\nGilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following theatrical reformer Tom Robertson.

Bond created the mezzo-soprano roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and is here leading into a description of Gilbert's role in reforming the Victorian theatre.

See Crowther (2011), p. 84 Over the next year, before the two first collaborated, Gilbert continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870) and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).\n\nSullivan before Gilbert\n\nSullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the Overture di Ballo, in 1870.[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/sullivan/interviews/lawrence.html \"An Illustrated Interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan, by Arthur H Lawrence, Part 1\"], The Strand Magazine, Volume xiv, No.84 (December 1897).

He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866).Shepherd, Marc, [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/sullorch.htm Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan: Orchestral and Band Music], The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 10 June 2007 These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901130842/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/sullivan2a.html Stephen Turnbull's Biography of W. S. Gilbert], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 22 November 2006\n\nSullivan's first foray into comic opera was Cox and Box (1866), written with librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine Fun) saying that Sullivan's score \"is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded.\"Harris, Roger, ed. (1999). Cox and Box. Chorleywood, Herts., UK: R. Clyde. pp. X–XI Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today. Sullivan and Burnand's second opera, The Contrabandista (1867) was not as successful.\n\nOperas\n\nFirst collaborations\n\nThespis\n\nIn 1871, producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, Thespis, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.Tillett, Selwyn and Spencer, Roderic. \"Forty Years of Thespis Scholarship\", text of talk delivered at the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival weekend, Cirencester, 21 September 2002.Jean-Bernard Piat: Guide du mélomane averti, Le Livre de Poche 8026, Paris 1992\n\nThespis opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,Walters, Michael. \"Thespis: a reply\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29. Summer 2011. but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.Williams, chapter 1 The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.\n\nOver the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on Happy Arcadia (1872) and with Alfred Cellier on Topsyturveydom (1874), and wrote The Wicked World (1873) Sweethearts (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his Festival Te Deum (1872); another oratorio, The Light of the World (1873); his only song cycle, The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens (1871); incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and hymns, including \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transportation; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.Jacobs, pp. 2–3Gillan, Don.

Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.Barker, John W. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515174236/http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html \"Gilbert and Sullivan\"], Madison Savoyards, Ltd., accessed 21 May 2007, quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of Trial by Jury to him: \"As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time.\"\n\nThe piece is one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since \"he is such a very bad lot,\" while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks \"substantial damages.\" After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of La Périchole. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/chap3.html Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment (Chapter 3)], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 May 2007\n\nFred Sullivan was the prototype for the \"patter\" (comic) baritone roles in the later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he \"was one of the most naturally comic little men I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest....\"Ayer p. 408 Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial comic little man role, as Burnand had put it. The \"patter\" baritone (or \"principal comedian\", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.\n\nAfter the success of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.Wachs, Kevin. [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/umgass/files/gasbag227.pdf \"Let’s vary piracee / With a little burglaree!\"], The Gasbag, Issue 227, Winter 2005, accessed 8 May 2012. Wachs concludes that much of the material from a draft of this opera later made its way into Act II of The Pirates of Penzance.\n\nEarly successes\n\nThe Sorcerer\n\nCarte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.\n\nGilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, \"The Elixir of Love,\" which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that The Sorcerer opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed Thespis.[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/index.html The Sorcerer], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 May 2007 While The Sorcerer won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of Trial by Jury. Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.\n\nH.M.S. Pinafore\n\nGilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.\n\nGilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in 'stagecraft', now called stage direction, by the playwrights James Planche and especially Tom Robertson. See Gilbert, W. S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/short_stories/stage_play.html A Stage Play]; and Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html Introduction]. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity.Cox-Ife, William. W. S. Gilbert: Stage Director. Dobson, 1978 . Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre.\"That Gilbert was a good director is not in doubt. He was able to extract from his actors natural, clear performances, which served the Gilbertian requirements of outrageousness delivered straight.\"[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1938719,00.html Mike Leigh interview]Baily, p. 335 As Jessie Bond wrote later:\n\nH.M.S.

The disgruntled former partners, who had invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers.Gillan, Don. [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-opcom.html \"The Assault on The Opera Comique\"], Stage Beauty, 2007, accessed 27 May 2009 This event cleared the way for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all of their succeeding operas.\n\nThe libretto of H.M.S. Pinafore relied on stock character types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.\n\nThe repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the \"respectability\" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits Pinafores theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the \"modern Major-General\" who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: \"resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!\"\n\nThe piece premiered in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright,Samuels, Edward.

Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.Ellmann, Richard Oscar Wilde, (Knopf, 1988) pp. 135 and 151–152  The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival \"aesthetic\" poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him. Richard D'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera's U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.\n\nDuring the run of Patience, Carte built the large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's permanent home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.See [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm this article on the Savoy Theatre], arthurlloyd.co.uk, accessed 20 July 2007.

See [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html this article on longest runs in the theatre up to 1920]\n\nIolanthe\n\nIolanthe (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in Iolanthe had taken a step forward. The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account Iolanthe his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\"Quoted in Allen 1975b, p. 176 Similarly, the Theatre asserted that \"the music of Iolanthe is Dr Sullivan's chef d'oeuvre. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works...\"William Beatty-Kingston, Theatre, 1 January 1883, quoted in Baily 1966, p. 246\n\nIolanthe is one of a number of Gilbert's works, including The Wicked World (1873), Broken Hearts (1875), Princess Ida (1884) and Fallen Fairies (1909), where the introduction of men and \"mortal love\" into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo.Cole, Sarah. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/broken_hearts/broken_hearts_synopsis.html Broken Hearts], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 December 2000, accessed 21 August 2012 Gilbert had created several \"fairy comedies\" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planché, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.[http://www.bartleby.com/223/0815.html \"W. S. Gilbert\"], The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907–21), Volume XIII, \"The Victorian Age\", Part One. VIII. Nineteenth-Century Drama, § 15, Bartleby.com, accessed 27 May 2009\n\nIn 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in Pinafore in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), heard a direct relay of parts of Iolanthe from the Savoy. This was probably the first live \"broadcast\" of an opera.Bradley (1996), p. 176\n\nDuring the run of Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera.Baily, p. 250 Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.\n\nPrincess Ida\n\nPrincess Ida (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.Stedman, pp. 200–01\n\nPrincess Ida was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after Ida opened, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\" As Princess Ida showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time.Jacobs, p. 187 In the meantime, when Ida closed, Carte produced a revival of The Sorcerer.\n\nDodging the magic lozenge\n\nThe Mikado\n\nThe most successful of the Savoy Operas was The Mikado (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters,Gilbert eventually found another opportunity to present his \"lozenge plot\" in The Mountebanks, written with Alfred Cellier in 1892 which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in \"human interest and probability\", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, The Sorcerer. As dramatised in the film Topsy-Turvy,albeit with the repetition of the apocryphal sword-falling story, see Jones, Brian (Spring 1985), \"The sword that never fell\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal 1 (1): 22–25 the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.\n\nThe story focuses on a \"cheap tailor,\" Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.\n\nWith the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, \"I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.\"[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/interviews/dlynws850121.html \"Workers and Their Work: Mr. W.S. Gilbert\"], Daily News, 21 January 1885, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012\n\nSetting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\"[http://pamphletpress.org/index.cfm?sec7&story_id\n69 Review of The Mikado], Pamphletpress.org, accessed 27 May 2009 G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: \"Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth.\"Dark and Grey, p. 101 Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including The Gondoliers, Utopia Limited, and The Grand Duke.\n\nThe Mikado became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre (surpassing the 571 performances of Pinafore and 576 of Patience) and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the operetta Les Cloches de Corneville, which held the title until Dorothy in 1886. See [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html this article on longest runs in the theatre up to 1920] The Mikado remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 37 It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.[http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm See here][http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm and here]\n\nRuddigore\n\nRuddigore (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian melodrama, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances. The original title, Ruddygore, together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics.[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/appeal.html See the Pall Mall Gazette's satire of Ruddygore.] Gilbert's response to being told the two spellings meant the same thing was: \"Not at all, for that would mean that if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don't.\" See [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/witter.htm this information from the Australian G&S site.] Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts.A copy of the Ruddigore libretto, including material cut before the first night and during the initial run, is   Nevertheless, the piece was profitable,[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/intro.html Information from the book Tit-Willow or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas] by Guy H. and Claude A. Walmisley (Privately Printed, Undated, early 20th century) and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, the Illustrated London News praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: \"Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.\"Perry, Helga. [http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/ruddigore/rud5.html Ruddygore], Illustrated London News, 9 January 1887, Savoyoperas.org.uk, accessed 27 May 2009 Further changes were made, including a new overture, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte revived Ruddigore after the First World War, and the piece was regularly performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.Critical apparatus in Hulme, David Russell, ed., Ruddigore. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2000)\n\nSome of the plot elements of Ruddigore were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits. When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the \"lozenge\" plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado.\n\nThe Yeomen of the Guard\n\nThe Yeomen of the Guard (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-early modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, Broken Hearts. The Times praised the libretto: \"It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things.\"Moratti, Mel. [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/yeomen.htm Yeomen, Homepages.ihug.co.nz, 5 March 2000, accessed 27 May 2009] Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, The Golden Legend, considered the score to Yeomen to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The Daily Telegraph wrote:\n\nYeomen was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,\n\nSullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as \"this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.\"Jacobs, p. 288\n\nThe Gondoliers\n\nThe Gondoliers (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of \"republican equality.\"[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/index.html The Gondoliers at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive], accessed 21 July 2007 Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the \"Stock Company Act\", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, Utopia Limited. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The Illustrated London News reported:\n\nSullivan's old collaborator on Cox and Box (later the editor of Punch magazine), F. C. Burnand, wrote to the composer: \"Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.\"Baily, p. 344 The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for H.M.S. Pinafore, Patience and The Mikado. There was a command performance of The Gondoliers for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. The Gondoliers was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.\n\nCarpet quarrel\n\nGilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.See, e.g., Stedman, pp. 254–56 and 323–24 and Ainger, pp. 193–94. In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with \"topsy-turvy\" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3 Also, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.See, e.g. Jacobs, p. 73; Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/life/long_bio.html The Life of W.S. Gilbert], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012; and Bond, Jessie. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/016.html The Reminiscences of Jessie Bond: Chapter 16], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012\n\nGilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.\n\nIn April 1890, however, during the run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.Ford, Tom. [http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/259962,gs-the-lennonmccartney-of-the-19th-century.aspx \"G&S: the Lennon/McCartney of the 19th century\"]. Limelight Magazine, Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011 Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\"Stedman, p. 270 As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:\n\nThings soon degraded, a legal hearing was held, and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell.Ainger, pp. 312–316 On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: \"The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived.\" Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.Shepherd, Marc. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/grand_duke/html/index.html \"Introduction: Historical Context\"], The Grand Duke, p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009. Linked at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 7 July 2009.\n\nGilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith,[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/gilbert/plays/plays_home.html Gilbert's Plays], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012 and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.Wolfson, p. 7\n\nLast works\n\nUtopia, Limited (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure.Wolfson, passim Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr.Wolfson, pp. 61–65 Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.\n\nAfter The Grand Duke, the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer. They did not speak to each other.Howarth, Paul.

Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been \"completely bridged over,\" and \"the most cordial relations existed between us.\"Walbrook, H. M. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap18.html \"The English Offenbach], Gilbert & Sullivan Opera: A History and a Comment, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 September 2003, accessed 27 May 2009 He stated that \"Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name.\"\n\nRichard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and his widow, Helen, continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works.Joseph, p. 146 Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 83 After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, Fallen Fairies (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.Baily, p. 425\n\nLegacy and assessment\n\nGilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, inherited the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances.Rollins and Witts, passimJoseph, passim The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere in Europe and around the world.Jellinek, Hedy and George. [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968oct26-00069 \"The One World of Gilbert and Sullivan\"], Saturday Review, 26 October 1968, pp. 69–72 and 94\n\nIn 1922, Sir Henry Wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:\n\nG. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas' success into the \"remote future\". He wrote that Gilbert's satire was \"too intelligent to be intelligible\" by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given \"wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words'] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it.\"Chesterton, G. K., introduction to Godwin, Augustine Henry. Gilbert & Sullivan: A Critical Appreciation of the Savoy Operas, E.P. Dutton & Co (1926) In 1957, a review in The Times gave this rationale for \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\":\n\nBecause of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a \"performing tradition\" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional.Bradley, Ian. Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan (2005) Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\"Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393 Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\".Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394 The National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities.Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 394–96 Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand.Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 398–99 In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960. The Savoy Company, an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia, continues to perform today.Fletcher, Juliet.

Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades.For example, in 1961 Guinness published an entire book of parodies of Gilbert and Sullivan lyrics, illustrated with cartoons, to advertise Guinness Stout. The book, by Anthony Groves-Raines with illustrations by Stanley Penn is called My Goodness! My Gilbert and Sullivan!  Numerous examples of advertising uses of Gilbert and Sullivan and the best-known Gilbert and Sullivan performers (likenesses, often in costume, or endorsements) are described in Cannon, John. \"Gilbert and Sullivan Celebrities in the World of Advertising\", Gilbert & Sullivan News, pp. 10–14, Vol. IV, No. 13, Spring 2011. Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film The Girl Said No.[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v19807 \"The Girl Said No (1937)\"], Allmovie.com, accessed September 27, 2015 There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (2000) and The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, Knights of Song[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id\n11585 \"Knights of Song\"] at the IBDB database and a 1975 West End show called Tarantara!

Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of Iolanthe.Borsuk, Alan J.

British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches. These include Conservative Peter Lilley's speech mimicking the form of \"I've got a little list\" from The Mikado, listing those he was against, including \"sponging socialists\" and \"young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue\". Political humour based on Gilbert and Sullivan's style and characters continues to be written.See [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/columnists/columnists.html?in_article_id\n465034&in_page_id1772&in_author_id\n322&in_check=N this Daily Mail editorial piece, dated 29 June 2007]\n\nCollaborations\n\nMajor works and original London runs\n\n* Thespis; or, The Gods Grown Old (1871) 63 performances\n* Trial by Jury (1875) 131 performances\n* The Sorcerer (1877) 178 performances\n* H.M.S.

[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/miscover.htm Overtures,]  A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography (2005) Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided,[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/interviews/gazette.html \"Sir Arthur Sullivan\"], Interviewed by The Pall Mall Gazette, 5 December 1889, accessed 21 August 2012 and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections.Hughes, p. 130 Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.\n\nThose Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers and The Grand Duke. Sullivan's authorship of the overture to Utopia, Limited cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). Thespis is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture.Rees, Terence. Thespis - A Gilbert & Sullivan Enigma. London (1964): Dillon's University Bookshop, p. 79. Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's Henry the VIII, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke.Ainger, p. 140  Of those remaining, the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier,Ainger, pp. 157 and 177 the overture to Patience is by Eugene d'Albert,Ainger, at p. 195 writes, \"That evening (21 April 1881) Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene D'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student at the National Training School (where Sullivan was the principal and supervisor of the composition dept.) and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year.\" Several months before that, Sullivan had given d'Albert the task of preparing a piano reduction of The Martyr of Antioch for use in choral rehearsals of that 1880 work. David Russell Hulme studied the handwriting in the score's manuscript and confirmed that it is that of Eugen, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by Jacobs), both of whose script he sampled and compared to the Patience manuscript. Hulme, Doctoral Thesis The Operettas of Sir Arthur Sullivan: a study of available autograph full scores, 1985, University of Wales, pp. 242–43. The Thesis is available from a number of libraries (and many copies have been circulated) including The British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby W. Yorks, Ref # DX171353, and Northern Illinois University, Call# :ML410.S95 H841986B. and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke (although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).Stone, David (2001), [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/ClarkeHamilton.htm \"Hamilton Clarke\",] Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 14 July 2008\n\nMost of the overtures are in three sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a concluding allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.\n\nIn the 1920s, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time, Geoffrey Toye, to write new overtures for Ruddigore and The Pirates of Penzance. Toye's Ruddigore overture entered the general repertory, and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke.Shepherd, Marc, [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/rud1924.htm The 1924 D'Oyly Carte Ruddigore], The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 14 July 2008 Toye's Pirates overture, however, did not last long and is now presumed lost.Shepherd, Marc.

This gave the Gondoliers overture the familiar fast-slow-fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures, and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan's original version.Hulme, David Russell.

S. Gilbert Society Journal, Vol. 4, Part 1, Summer 2010\n\nThere are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular Der Mikado. There is even a German version of The Grand Duke. Some German translations were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée, librettists of Die Fledermaus and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of Sullivan's lesser-known operas, The Chieftain, as (Der Häuptling).\n\nBallets\n\n* Pirates of Penzance - The Ballet!, created for the Queensland Ballet in 1991\n* Pineapple Poll, created by John Cranko in 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre; in repertoire at the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The ballet is based on Gilbert's 1870 Bab Ballad \"The Bumboat Woman's Story\", as is H.M.S. Pinafore. Cranko expanded the plotline of Gilbert's poem and added a happy ending. The music is arranged by Sir Charles Mackerras from themes by Sullivan.\n\nAdaptations\n\nGilbert adapted the stories of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado into children's books called The Pinafore Picture Book and The Story of The Mikado giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos.Stedman, p. 331Gilbert, W.
