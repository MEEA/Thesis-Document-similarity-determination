  "textBody" : "Jean Frédéric Bazille (December 6, 1841 – November 28, 1870) was a French Impressionist painter. Many of Bazille's major works are examples of figure painting in which he placed the subject figure within a landscape painted en plein air.\n\nLife and work\n\nFrédéric Bazille was born in Montpellier, Hérault, Languedoc-Roussillon, France, into a wealthy Protestant family. He became interested in painting after seeing some works of Eugène Delacroix. His family agreed to let him study painting, but only if he also studied medicine.\n\nBazille began studying medicine in 1859, and moved to Paris in 1862 to continue his studies. There he met Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley, was drawn to Impressionist painting, and began taking classes in Charles Gleyre's studio. After failing his medical exam in 1864, he began painting full-time. His close friends included Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Édouard Manet. Bazille was generous with his wealth, and helped support his less fortunate associates by giving them space in his studio and materials to use.\n\nBazille was just twenty-three years old when he painted several of his best-known works, including The Pink Dress (c. 1864, Musée d'Orsay, Paris). This painting combines a portrait-like depiction of Bazille's cousin, Thérèse des Hours, who is seen from behind—and the sunlit landscape at which she gazes.Rosenblum, 1989, p. 225 His best-known painting is Family Reunion of 1867–1868 (Musée d'Orsay, Paris).\n\nFrédéric Bazille joined a Zouave regiment in August 1870, a month after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. On November 28 of that year, he was with his unit at the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande when, his officer having been injured, he took command and led an assault on the German position. He was hit twice in the failed attack and died on the battlefield at the age of twenty-eight. His father travelled to the battlefield a few days later to take his body back for burial at Montpellier over a week later.\n\nMain works\n\n* La Robe rose, (1864) –   147 x 110 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris \n* Atelier de la rue Furstenberg, –  80 x 65 cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier \n* Aigues-Mortes, –  46 x 55 cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier  \n* Autportrait, (1865) –  109x72 cm, Art Institute of Chicago \n* Réunion de Famille, (1867) –   152 x 230 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris \n* Le Pécheur à l'épervier, (1868) –   134 x 83 cm, Fondation Rau pour le tiers-monde, Zürich \n* Vue de village, (1868) –    130 x 89 cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier \n* Scène d'été, 1869 –  158 x 158 cm, Cambridge, Harvard University \n* La Toilette, (1870) –   132 x 127 cm., Musée Fabre, Montpellier \n* L'Atelier de la rue Condamine, (1870) –   98 x 128.5 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris \n* Paysage au bord du Lez, (1870) –   137.8 x 202.5 cm, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis \n\nSelected paintings\n\nFile:Bazille, Frédéric - Self Portrait.jpeg|Self Portrait, unknown date\nFile:Frédéric Bazille - The Pink Dress - Google Art Project.jpg|The Pink Dress (View of Castelnau-le-Lez, Hérault), 1864, oil on canvas, Musée d'Orsay\nImage:Bazille_Sutdio_in_the_rue_de_Furstenberg.jpg|Studio in the Rue de Furstenberg, 1865, Musée Fabre, oil on canvas, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nFile:Renoir by Bazille.jpg|Portrait of Renoir, 1867, oil on canvas, Musée d'Orsay\nFile:Frédéric Bazille - The Little Gardener - Google Art Project.jpg|Le Petit Jardinier (The Little Gardener), c. 1866-67, oil on canvas Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\nFile:Frédéric Bazille - Nature morte avec du poisson.jpg| Nature morte avec du poisson, Still life with fish, c. 1866-67. \nFile:Bazille, Frédéric - Aigues-Mortes.jpeg|Aigues-Mortes, 1867\nImage:Frédéric Bazille 001.jpg|Family Reunion, c. 1867, Musée d'Orsay\nFile:Bazille-Nature morte au héron.JPG|Nature morte au héron, 1867\nFile:Bazille, Frédéric ~ View of the Village, 1868.jpg|View of the Village, 1868, Musée Fabre \nFile:Bazille - Pêcheur à l'épervier.jpg|Fisherman with a Net, 1868\nFile:Bazille, Frederic — Flowers — 1868.jpg| Flowers — 1868\nFile:Frédéric Bazille - Portrait de Paul Verlaine comme une Troubadour.jpg|Portrait of Paul Verlaine,  1868, Dallas Museum of Art\nImage:Bazille,_Frédéric_~_Summer_Scene,_1869,_Oil_on_canvas_Fogg_Art_Museum,_Cambridge,_Massachusetts.jpg|Scène d'été, 1869,\nFile:Bazille, Frédéric - Portrait of Edmond Maitre.jpeg|Portrait of , 1869\nImage:Bazille_La_Toilette.jpg|La Toilette, 1870, Musée Fabre\n\nNotes",
