The high commissioner of Greenland is appointed by the monarch (on from 2011: Queen Margrethe II), and the prime minister is elected indirectly by parliament elections results for four-year terms.\n\nThe High Commissioner has a seat in the Inatsisartut, he or she is allowed to speak in the Inatsisartut regarding common Danish/Greenlandic affairs, but he or she is not allowed to vote.[http://www.stm.dk/_a_1673.html Stm.dk, the website of the High Commissioner of Greenland, as part of the Danish Prime Minister's Office] Following legislative elections, the leader of the party that wins the most seats is usually given the initiative to establish a new coalition by the Greenlandic Parliament, unless the current Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat (Prime Minister in English) is still in power. However, if he/she fails, the Chairman of the parliament asks all chairmen of the parties elected to the parliament, and asks them to point to another chairman who they feel can rightly form a new coalition. The chairman with the most votes is then handed the initiative. After forming the coalition, the Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat leads the Naalakkersuisut. The Naalakkersuisut will often consist of around 9 members. The coalition parties divide the various ministries among themselves and after this, the parties elect their representative to these ministries. Any other member of the cabinet is called a Naalakkersuisoq.\n\nLegislative branch\n\nLegislative power is shared by the government and the legislature. The legislature Greenlandic Parliament () is made up of 31 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve four-year terms by proportional representation. Election of 2 seats to the Danish Parliament () was last held on June 18, 2015. The current composition is shown below\n\nJudicial branch\n\nGreenland's judicial system is based on the Danish civil law system, operates independently of the legislature and the executive. It has two court of first instance: the District Courts and the Court of Greenland depending on the type of case, whereas the High Court of Greenland hears cases as the second instance. Decisions made by the High Court of Greenland may be brought before the Supreme Court subject to the permission of the Appeals Permission Board. Appeals may be submitted to the Østre Landsret and the Supreme Court of Denmark (Højesteret).\n\nPolitical parties and elections \n\nGreenland has a multi-party system (disputing independence versus unionism as well as left versus right). Governments are usually coalition governments. The Greenlandic Parliament (Inatsisartut) has 31 seats. Members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.\n\nAdministrative divisions \n\nThe island is administratively divided into 4 municipalities[http://www.stat.gl/publ/en/GF/2014/pdf/Greenland%20in%20Figures%202014.pdf Greenland in Figures, 2014] with about 74 cities and villages.\n\nInternational affairs \n\nAlong with diplomatic missions to the European Union and the United States,[http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut Missions of Greenland abroad, naalakkersuisut.gl (without date).] Greenland participates in the Nordic Council, Arctic Council, International Whaling Commission ([http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut/Departments/Udenrigsdirektoratet/Om-Udenrigsdirektoratet/Ansvarsomraader Complete list of participation of Greenland in international organisations]).\n\nWith Denmark having responsibility for Greenland's international affairs, other countries do not have direct diplomatic representation in Greenland — their embassies or consulates in Copenhagen are responsible for their relations with Greenland and their citizens staying or living there.\n\nGreenland is represented internationally by the embassies and consulates of Denmark, although Greenland has an independent Representation to the European Union in Brussels since 1992[http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut/Greenland-Representation-to-the-EU/Greenland-Representation-to-the-EU Greenland Representation to the EU], accessed 16 May 2016 and in the United States in Washington D.C since 2014.[http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut/Groenlands-repraesentation-Washington Greenland Representation in the United States], accessed 02 April 2017",
