Demographic topics include basic education, health, and population statistics as well as identified racial and religious affiliations.\n\nPopulation \n\nAccording to  the total population was  in , compared to only 6 442 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 44.1%, 52.6% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% was 65 years or older\n.[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision] \n\nVital statistics \n\nRegistration of vital events is in Mozambique not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.\n\nAlso, according to a 2011 survey, the total fertility rate was 5.9 children per woman, with 6.6 in rural areas and 4.5 in urban areas.\n\nFertility and births \n\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\n\nFertility data as of 2011 (DHS Program):\n\nEthnic groups \n\nMozambique's major ethnic groups encompass numerous subgroups with diverse languages, dialects, cultures, and histories. Many are linked to similar ethnic groups living in inland countries.\nThe estimated 4 million Makua are the largest ethnic group of the country and are dominant in the northern part of the country — the Sena and Shona (mostly Ndau) are prominent in the Zambezi valley, and the Shangaan (Tsonga) dominate in southern Mozambique. Other groups include Makonde, Yao, Swahili, Tonga, Chopi, and Nguni (including Zulu). The country is also home to a growing number of white residents, most with Portuguese ancestry. During colonial rule, European residents hailed from every Mozambican province, and at the time of independence the total population was estimated at around 360,000. Most vacated the region after independence in 1975, emigrating to Portugal as retornados. There is also a larger mestiço minority with mixed African and Portuguese heritage. The remaining non-Blacks in Mozambique are primarily Indian Asiatics, who have arrived from Pakistan, Portuguese India, and numerous Arab countries. There are various estimates for the size of Mozambique's Chinese community, ranging from 1,500 to 12,000 .\n\nLanguages \n\nPortuguese is the official and most widely spoken language of the nation, but in 2007 only 50.4% of Mozambique's population speak Portuguese as either their first or second language, and only 10.7% speak Portuguese as their first language. Arabs, Chinese, and Indians speak their own languages (Indians from Portuguese India speak any of the Portuguese Creoles of their origin) aside from Portuguese as their second language. Most educated Mozambicans speak English, which is used in schools and business as second or third language.\n\nReligion \n\nCulture \n\nDespite the influence of Islamic coastal traders and European colonizers, the people of Mozambique have largely retained an indigenous culture based on smallscale agriculture. Mozambique's most highly developed art forms have been wood sculpture, for which the Makonde in northern Mozambique are particularly renowned, and dance. The middle and upper classes continue to be heavily influenced by the Portuguese colonial and linguistic heritage.\n\nEducation and health \n\nUnder Portugal, educational opportunities for poor Mozambicans were limited; 93% of the Bantu population was illiterate, and many could not speak Portuguese. In fact, most of today's political leaders were educated in missionary schools. After independence, the government placed a high priority on expanding education, which reduced the illiteracy rate to about two-thirds as primary school enrollment increased. Unfortunately, in recent years school construction and teacher training enrollments have not kept up with population increases. With post-war enrollments reaching all-time highs, the quality of education has suffered. As a member of Commonwealth of Nations, most urban Mozambicans are required to learn English starting high-school.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nPopulation:\n* 22,948,858 (July 2011 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate:\n* 2.444% (2011 est.)\n\nSex ratio\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female (2003 est.), 1.02 male(s)/female (2007 est.)\nunder 15 years: 0.98 male(s)/female (2003 est.), 1.01 male(s)/female (2007 est.)\n15-64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female (2003 est.), 0.949 male(s)/female (2007 est.)\n65 years and over: 0.7 male(s)/female (2003 est.), 0.717 male(s)/female (2007 est.)\ntotal population: 0.96 male(s)/female (2003 est.), 0.968 male(s)/female (2007 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population:\ntotal population: 51.78 years\nmale:\nmale: 51.01 years\nfemale:\nfemale: 52.57 years (2011 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS — people living with HIV/AIDS: 1.4 million (2009 est.)\nHIV/AIDS — deaths: 74,000 (2009 est.)\n\nNationality:\nnoun:\nMozambican(s)\nadjective:\nMozambican\n\nEthnic groups:\n\nIndigenous tribal groups (including the Shangana, Chokwe, Manyika, Sena, Makua, Ndau, among others) make up 98.61% of Mozambique's total population.
