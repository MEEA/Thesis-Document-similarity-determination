  "textBody" : "The galjoen, black bream, or blackfish (Dichistius capensis) is a species of marine fish found only along the  coast of southern Africa from Angola to South Africa.  \nGaljoen is the national fish of South Africa.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nThe galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern Africa from Angola to South Africa, and is generally found around reefs at shallow depths around 10 m, often near the shore.\n\nDescription\n\nThis species can reach 80 cm in total length and a weight of . The body is compressed, and the fins are well developed, with prominent spines,  10 of them, with between 18 and 23 rays. The anal fin has three spines, and usually 13 or 14 rays, the pelvic fins have 1 spine and 5 rays, and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head.
