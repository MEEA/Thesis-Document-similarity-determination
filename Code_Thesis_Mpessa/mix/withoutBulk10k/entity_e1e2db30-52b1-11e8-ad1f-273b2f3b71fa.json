  "textBody" : "The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America at the retail price of $169.95. It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridge–based video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS.\n\nThe console\n\nThe Channel F electronics were designed by Jerry Lawson using the Fairchild F8 CPU, the first public outing of this processor. The F8 was very complex compared to the typical integrated circuits of the day, and had more inputs and outputs than other contemporary chips. Because chip packaging was not available with enough pins, the F8 was instead fabricated as a pair of chips that had to be used together to form a complete CPU.\n\nLawson worked with Nick Talesfore and Ron Smith. As manager of Industrial Design, Talesfore was responsible for the design of the hand controllers, console, and video game cartridges. Smith was responsible for the mechanical engineering of the video cartridges and controllers. All worked for Wilf Corigan, head of Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera & Instrument.\n\n The graphics are quite basic by modern standards. The Channel F is only able to use one plane of graphics and one of four background colors per line, only three plot colors to choose from (red, green, and blue) that turned into white if the background is set to black. A resolution of 128 × 64 with approximately 102 × 58 pixels visible and help from only 64 bytes of system RAM, half the amount of the Atari 2600. The F8 processor at the heart of the console is able to produce enough AI to allow for player versus computer matches, a first in console history. All previous machines required a human opponent.\n\nOne feature unique to this console is the 'hold' button, which allowed the player to freeze the game, change the time or change the speed of the game. In the original unit, sound is played through an internal speaker, rather than the TV set. However, the System II passed sound to the television through the RF modulator.\n\nControllers\n\nThe controllers are a joystick without a base; the main body is a large hand grip with a triangular \"cap\" on top, the top being the portion that actually moved for eight-way directional control. It could be used as both a joystick and paddle (twist), and not only could it be pushed down to operate as a fire button it could be pulled up as well. The model 1 unit contained a small compartment for storing the controllers when moving it. The System II featured detachable controllers and had two holders at the back to wind the cable around and to store the controller in. Zircon later offered a special control which featured an action button on the front of the joystick. It was marketed by Zircon as \"Channel F Jet-Stick\" in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas 1982.http://fndcollectables.com/CHANNEL_F_INFO/U_S_/Adds___Offers/LETTERS/x82fr1f.jpg\n\nDespite the failure of the Channel F, the joystick's design was so popular—Creative Computing called it \"outstanding\"— that Zircon also released an Atari joystick port-compatible version, the Video Command Joystick, first released without the extra fire button. Before that, only the downwards plunge motion was connected and acted as the fire button; the pull-up and twist actions weren't connected to anything.\n\nGames\n\nTwenty-seven cartridges, termed 'Videocarts', were officially released to consumers in the United States during the ownership of Fairchild and Zircon, the first twenty-one of which were released by Fairchild. Several of these cartridges were capable of playing more than one game and were typically priced at $19.95. The Videocarts were yellow and approximately the size and overall texture of an 8 track cartridge. They usually featured colorful label artwork. The earlier artwork was created by nationally known artist Tom Kamifuji and art directed by Nick Talesfore. The console contained two built-in games, Tennis and Hockey, which were both advanced Pong clones. In Hockey the reflecting bar could be changed to diagonals by twisting the controller, and could move all over the playing field. Tennis was much like the original Pong.\n\nA sales brochure from 1978 listed 'Keyboard Videocarts' for sale. The three shown were K-1 Casino Poker, K-2 Space Odyssey, and K-3 Pro-Football. These were intended to use the Keyboard accessory. All further brochures, released after Zircon took over Fairchild, never listed this accessory nor anything called a Keyboard Videocart.\n\nThere was one additional cartridge released numbered Videocart-51 and simply titled 'Demo 1'. This Videocart was shown in a single sales brochure released shortly after Zircon acquired the company. It was never listed for sale after this single brochure which was used in the winter of 1979.\n\nList of games\n\nCarts listed (as mentioned above) but never released:\n*Keyboard Videocart-1: Casino Poker\n*Keyboard Videocart-2: Space Odyssey\n*Keyboard Videocart-3: Pro-Football\n\nOfficial carts that also exist:\n*Democart 2\n\nGerman SABA also released a few compatible carts different from the original carts, translation in Videocart 1 Tic-Tac-Toe to German words, Videocart 3 released with different abbreviations (German), Videocart 18 changed graphics and German word list and the SABA 20, a chess game released only by SABA.\n\nA homebrew clone of Pac-Man for the Channel F was released in 2009.[http://www.consolecity.com/games/action-game_info/game_id-29406.html ConsoleCity.com || Channel F - Videocart 27: Pac-Man (USC)]\n\nReception\n\nKen Uston reviewed 32 games in his book Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games in 1982, and rated some of the Channel F's titles highly; of these, Alien Invasion and Video Whizball were considered by Uston to be \"the finest adult cartridges currently available for the Fairchild Channel F System.\"Uston, Ken. Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games (Signet, 1982) p.605 The games on a whole, however, rated last on his survey of over 200 games for the Atari, Intellivision, Astrocade and Odyssey consoles, and contemporary games were rated \"Average\" with future Channel F games rated \"below average\".Uston, Ken. Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games (Signet, 1982) p.20. Uston rated almost one half of the Channel F games as \"high in interest\" and called that \"an impressive proportion\" and further noted that \"Some of the Channel F cartridges are timeless; no matter what technological developments occur, they will continue to be of interest.\" His overall conclusion was that the games \"serve a limited, but useful, purpose\" and that the \"strength of the Channel F offering is in its excellent educational line for children.\"Uston, Ken. Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games (Signet, 1982) p.603 and p.23.\n\nIn 1983, after Zircon announced its discontinuation of the Channel F, Video Games reviewed the console. Calling it \"the system nobody knows\", the magazine described its graphics and sounds as \"somewhat primitive by today's standards\". It described Space War as perhaps \"the most antiquated game of its type still on the market\", and rated the 25 games for the console with an average grade of three (\"not too good\") on a scale from one to ten. The magazine stated, however, that Fairchild \"managed to create some fascinating games, even by today's standards\", calling Casino Royale (Video Blackjack) \"the best card game, from blackjack to bridge, made for any TV-game system\". It also favorably reviewed Dodge-It (\"simple but great\"), Robot War (\"Berzerk without guns\"), and Whizball (\"thoroughly original ... hockey with guns\"), but concluded that only those interested in nostalgia, video game collecting, or card games would purchase the Channel F in 1983.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nOriginal Channel F technical specifications:\n* CPU microprocessor: Fairchild F8 (8-bit)[http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg70-fairchild.htm Fairchild Channel F | Video Game Console Library] operating at 1.79 MHz (NTSC) (PAL gen. 1: 2.00 MHz, PAL gen. 2: 1.77 MHz)\n* RAM: 2 KB (128×64×2 bits)[https://books.google.com/books?id\noK3D4i5ldKgC&pg=PA65 Before the Crash: Early Video Game History - Mark J.
