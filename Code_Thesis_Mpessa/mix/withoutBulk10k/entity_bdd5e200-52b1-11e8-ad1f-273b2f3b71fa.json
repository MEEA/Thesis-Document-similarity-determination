Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements, are called transcendental.\n\nFor example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q()/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers.\n\nAll transcendental extensions are of infinite degree. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.See also Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 3. The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic.
