  "textBody" : "A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive or disturbing to its viewers. They contain material of high shock value, generally of a pornographic, scatological, graphically violent, insulting, obscenely vulgar, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.  Typically, the subject material of such sites deliberately degrades and debases a being or object. Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, video clip or small gallery, and are circulated via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a prank.
