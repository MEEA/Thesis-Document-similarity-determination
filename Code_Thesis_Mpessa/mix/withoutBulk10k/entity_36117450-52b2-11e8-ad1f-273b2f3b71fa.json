  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.  That is, it is a prime number of the form  for some integer .  They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe exponents  which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, ...  and the resulting Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, ... .\n\nIf  is a composite number then so is . ( is divisible by both  and .) This definition is therefore equivalent to a definition as a prime number of the form  for some prime .\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form  without the primality requirement are called Mersenne numbers.  Mersenne numbers are sometimes defined to have the additional requirement that  be prime, equivalently that they be pernicious Mersenne numbers, namely those numbers whose binary representation contains a prime number of ones and no zeros.  The smallest composite pernicious Mersenne number is .\n\nMersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers.\n\nA new Mersenne prime was found in December 2017. , 50 are now known. The largest known prime number  is a Mersenne prime. Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a distributed computing project on the Internet.\n\nAbout Mersenne primes\n\nMany fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their order of growth. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are composite, although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of Sophie Germain primes congruent to 3 (mod 4). For these primes ,  (which is also prime) will divide , e.g., , , , , , , , and  . Since for these primes ,  is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a quadratic residue mod , and the multiplicative order of 2 mod  must divide \\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2} . Since  is a prime, it must be  or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since \\Phi_1(2)\n1 and 1 has no prime factors, so it must be . Hence,  divides \\Phi_p(2)2^p-1 and  \n  cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are\n\n, ,  and .\n\nA basic theorem about Mersenne numbers states that if  is prime, then the exponent  must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&\n(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as .\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that  is prime for all primes , this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size. Nonetheless, prime  appear to grow increasingly sparse as  increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes  give rise to a Mersenne prime  (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while  is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The Lucas–Lehmer primality test (LLT) is an efficient primality test that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a cult following. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using distributed computing.\n\nMersenne primes are used in pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne twister, Park–Miller random number generator, Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.\n\nPerfect numbers\n\nMersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection with perfect numbers. In the 4th century BC, Euclid proved that if  is prime, then ) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as , is the th triangular number and the th hexagonal number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists] This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. It is unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers.\n\nHistory\n\nMersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century French scholar Marin Mersenne, who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257.  The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n:2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included  and  (which are composite) and omitted , , and  (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].\n\nÉdouard Lucas proved in 1876 that  is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.   was determined to be prime in 1883 by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin, though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that  is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by Frank Nelson Cole in 1903.  Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one.  On the other side of the board, he multiplied  and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking. p. 228. He later said that the result had taken him \"three years of Sundays\" to find. A correct list of all Mersenne primes in this number range was completed and rigorously verified only about three centuries after Mersenne published his list.\n\nSearching for Mersenne primes\n\nFast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and  the seven largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes , ,  and  were known in antiquity. The fifth, , was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ( and ) were found by Pietro Cataldi in 1588. After nearly two centuries,  was verified to be prime by Leonhard Euler in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was , found by Édouard Lucas in 1876, then  by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin in 1883. Two more ( and ) were found early in the 20th century, by R. E. Powers in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime ,  is prime if and only if  divides , where  and  for .\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas–Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229. Unfortunately for those investigators, the interval they were testing contains the largest known gap between Mersenne primes, in relative terms: the next Mersenne prime exponent, 521, would turn out to be more than four times larger than the previous record of 127.\n\nThe search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. Alan Turing searched for them on the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949,Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1]. but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, , by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the direction of Lehmer, with a computer search program written and run by Prof. R. M. Robinson. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, , was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more — , ,  — were found by the same program in the next several months.  is the first Mersenne prime that is titanic,  is the first gigantic, and  was the first megaprime to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime]. All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size. The number of digits in the decimal representation of  equals , where  denotes the floor function (or equivalently ).\n\nIn September 2008, mathematicians at UCLA participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a Dell OptiPlex 745 on August 23, 2008.  This was the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA.\n\nOn April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is . Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a 48th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.\n\nOn January 19, 2016, Cooper published his discovery of a 49th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 22,338,618 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network. This was the fourth Mersenne prime discovered by Cooper and his team in the past ten years.\n\nOn January 3, 2018, it was announced that Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, had found a 50th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 23,249,425 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.\n\nTheorems about Mersenne numbers\n\n# If  and  are natural numbers such that  is prime, then  or .\n#* Proof: . Then , so . Thus . However,  is prime, so  or . In the former case, , hence  (which is a contradiction, as neither −1 nor 0 is prime) or  In the latter case,  or . If , however,  which is not prime. Therefore, .\n# If  is prime, then  is prime.\n#* Proof: suppose that  is composite, hence can be written  with a and . Then     so  is composite. By contrapositive, if  is prime then p is prime.\n# If  is an odd prime, then every prime  that divides  must be 1 plus a multiple of . This holds even when  is prime.\n#* Examples: Example I:  is prime, and . Example II: , where , and .\n#* Proof: By Fermat's little theorem,  is a factor of . Since  is a factor of , for all positive integers ,  is also a factor of . Since  is prime and  is not a factor of ,  is also the smallest positive integer  such that  is a factor of . As a result, for all positive integers ,  is a factor of  if and only if  is a factor of . Therefore, since  is a factor of ,  is a factor of  so . Furthermore, since  is a factor of , which is odd,  is odd. Therefore, .\n#* Note: This fact provides a proof of Euclid's theorem, which asserts the infinitude of primes, distinct from the proof written by Euclid: for every odd prime , all primes dividing  are larger than ; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.\n#* Note: In conjunction with the next theorem below, certain multiples of  are impossible, namely when  is multiplied by twice an odd number. Thus for instance , , , and so forth cannot be factors of . Proof: Each factor must have   for some  and , so if we assume  \n  then we get either   or  \n , each of which is a contradiction as one side of the equation is odd and the other is even. More generally we can show that , and .\n# If  is an odd prime, then every prime  that divides  is congruent to .\n#* Proof: , so  is a square root of .  By quadratic reciprocity, every prime modulo in which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to .\n# A Mersenne prime cannot be a Wieferich prime.\n#* Proof: We show if  is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence  does not hold. By Fermat's little theorem, . Now write, . If the given congruence is satisfied, then ,therefore   . Hence ,and therefore . This leads to , which is impossible since .\n#If  and  are natural numbers then  and  are coprime if and only if  and  are coprime. Consequently, a prime number divides at most one prime-exponent Mersenne number,[http://www.garlic.com/~wedgingt/mersenne.html Will Edgington's Mersenne Page]  so in other words the set of pernicious Mersenne numbers is pairwise coprime.\n# If  and  are both prime (meaning that  is a Sophie Germain prime), and  is congruent to , then  divides .\n#* Example: 11 and 23 are both prime, and , so 23 divides .\n#* Proof: Let  be . By Fermat's little theorem, , so either  or . Supposing latter true, then , so −2 would be a quadratic residue mod . However, since  is congruent to ,  is congruent to  and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod . Also since  is congruent to , −1 is a quadratic nonresidue mod , so −2 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and  divides .\n# All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers pass the Fermat primality test for the base 2.\n\nList of known Mersenne primes\n\nThe table below lists all known Mersenne primes (sequence  () and  () in OEIS):\n\nAll Mersenne numbers below the 49th Mersenne prime () have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and the 31st. Similarly,  was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later.[http://www.mersenne.org/report_milestones/ GIMPS Milestones Report]. Retrieved 2018-01-27  was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million decimal digits.\n\nThe largest known Mersenne prime  is also the largest known prime number.\n\nIn modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.The largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime since 1952, except between 1989 and 1992; see Caldwell, \"[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History]\" from the Prime Pages website, University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\nFactorization of composite Mersenne numbers\n\nSince they are prime numbers, Mersenne primes are divisible only by 1 and by themselves.  However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored nontrivially.  Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the special number field sieve algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  , 2 − 1 is the record-holder,Thorsten Kleinjung, Joppe Bos, Arjen Lenstra \"Mersenne Factorization Factory\" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf having been factored with a variant of the special number field sieve that allows the factorization of several numbers at once.  See integer factorization records for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a primality test on the cofactor. , the largest factorization with probable prime factors allowed is , where  is a 1,577,600-digit probable prime.  , the Mersenne number M1277 is the smallest composite Mersenne number with no known factors; it has no prime factors below 265.\n\nThe table below shows factorizations for the first 20 composite Mersenne numbers .\n\nMersenne primitive part\n\nThe primitive part of Mersenne number  is , the th cyclotomic polynomial at 2, they are\n1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 3, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 57, 524287, 205, 2359, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... \n\nBesides, if we notice those prime factors, and delete \"old prime factors\", for example, 3 divides the 2nd, 6th, 18th, 54th, 162nd, ... terms of this sequence, we only allow the 2nd term divided by 3, if we do, they are\n1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 1, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 19, 524287, 41, 337, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... \n\nThe numbers  for which  is prime are\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 150, ... \n\nThe numbers  for which  has an only primitive prime factor are\n2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 54, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 147, 150, ...

An example is , in this case, , and ; another example is , in this case, , and .\n\nIt is also natural to try to generalize primes of the form  to primes of the form  (for  and ). However (see also theorems above),  is always divisible by , so unless the latter is a unit, the former is not a prime. There are two ways to deal with that:\n\nComplex numbers\n\nIn the ring of integers (on real numbers), if  is a unit, then  is either 2 or 0. But  are the usual Mersenne primes, and the formula  does not lead to anything interesting (since it is always −1 for all ). Thus, we can regard a ring of \"integers\" on complex numbers instead of real numbers, like Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers.\n\nGaussian Mersenne primes\n\nIf we regard the ring of Gaussian integers, we get the case  and , and can ask (WLOG) for what  the number  is a Gaussian prime which will then be called a Gaussian Mersenne prime.Chris Caldwell: [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/GaussianMersenne.html The Prime Glossary: Gaussian Mersenne] (part of the Prime Pages)\n\n is a Gaussian prime for the following :\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 29, 47, 73, 79, 113, 151, 157, 163, 167, 239, 241, 283, 353, 367, 379, 457, 997, 1367, 3041, 10141, 14699, 27529, 49207, 77291, 85237, 106693, 160423, 203789, 364289, 991961, 1203793, 1667321, 3704053, 4792057, ... \n\nThis sequence is in many ways similar to the list of exponents of ordinary Mersenne primes.\n\nThe norms (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Gaussian primes are rational primes:\n\n5, 13, 41, 113, 2113, 525313, 536903681, 140737471578113, ... .\n\nEisenstein Mersenne primes\n\nWe can also regard the ring of Eisenstein integers,  we get the case  and , and can ask for what  the number  is an Eisenstein prime which will then be called a Eisenstein Mersenne prime.\n\n is an Eisenstein prime for the following :\n\n2, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 79, 163, 193, 239, 317, 353, 659, 709, 1049, 1103, 1759, 2029, 5153, 7541, 9049, 10453, 23743, 255361, 534827, 2237561, ... \n\nThe norms (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Eisenstein primes are rational primes:\n\n7, 271, 2269, 176419, 129159847, 1162320517, ... \n\nDivide an integer\n\nRepunit primes\n\nThe other way to deal with the fact that  is always divisible by , it is to simply take out this factor and ask which values of  make\n\\frac{b^n-1}{b-1}\nbe prime.

    "aggregatedText" : "In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.  That is, it is a prime number of the form  for some integer .  They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe exponents  which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, ...  and the resulting Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, ... .\n\nIf  is a composite number then so is . ( is divisible by both  and .) This definition is therefore equivalent to a definition as a prime number of the form  for some prime .\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form  without the primality requirement are called Mersenne numbers.  Mersenne numbers are sometimes defined to have the additional requirement that  be prime, equivalently that they be pernicious Mersenne numbers, namely those numbers whose binary representation contains a prime number of ones and no zeros.  The smallest composite pernicious Mersenne number is .\n\nMersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers.\n\nA new Mersenne prime was found in December 2017. , 50 are now known. The largest known prime number  is a Mersenne prime. Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a distributed computing project on the Internet.\n\nAbout Mersenne primes\n\nMany fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their order of growth. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are composite, although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of Sophie Germain primes congruent to 3 (mod 4). For these primes ,  (which is also prime) will divide , e.g., , , , , , , , and  . Since for these primes ,  is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a quadratic residue mod , and the multiplicative order of 2 mod  must divide \\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2} . Since  is a prime, it must be  or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since \\Phi_1(2)\n1 and 1 has no prime factors, so it must be . Hence,  divides \\Phi_p(2)2^p-1 and  \n  cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are\n\n, ,  and .\n\nA basic theorem about Mersenne numbers states that if  is prime, then the exponent  must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&\n(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as .\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that  is prime for all primes , this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size. Nonetheless, prime  appear to grow increasingly sparse as  increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes  give rise to a Mersenne prime  (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while  is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The Lucas–Lehmer primality test (LLT) is an efficient primality test that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a cult following. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using distributed computing.\n\nMersenne primes are used in pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne twister, Park–Miller random number generator, Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.\n\nPerfect numbers\n\nMersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection with perfect numbers. In the 4th century BC, Euclid proved that if  is prime, then ) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as , is the th triangular number and the th hexagonal number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists] This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. It is unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers.\n\nHistory\n\nMersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century French scholar Marin Mersenne, who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257.  The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n:2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included  and  (which are composite) and omitted , , and  (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].\n\nÉdouard Lucas proved in 1876 that  is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.   was determined to be prime in 1883 by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin, though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that  is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by Frank Nelson Cole in 1903.  Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one.  On the other side of the board, he multiplied  and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking. p. 228. He later said that the result had taken him \"three years of Sundays\" to find. A correct list of all Mersenne primes in this number range was completed and rigorously verified only about three centuries after Mersenne published his list.\n\nSearching for Mersenne primes\n\nFast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and  the seven largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes , ,  and  were known in antiquity. The fifth, , was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ( and ) were found by Pietro Cataldi in 1588. After nearly two centuries,  was verified to be prime by Leonhard Euler in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was , found by Édouard Lucas in 1876, then  by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin in 1883. Two more ( and ) were found early in the 20th century, by R. E. Powers in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime ,  is prime if and only if  divides , where  and  for .\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas–Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229. Unfortunately for those investigators, the interval they were testing contains the largest known gap between Mersenne primes, in relative terms: the next Mersenne prime exponent, 521, would turn out to be more than four times larger than the previous record of 127.\n\nThe search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. Alan Turing searched for them on the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949,Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1]. but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, , by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the direction of Lehmer, with a computer search program written and run by Prof. R. M. Robinson. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, , was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more — , ,  — were found by the same program in the next several months.  is the first Mersenne prime that is titanic,  is the first gigantic, and  was the first megaprime to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime]. All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size. The number of digits in the decimal representation of  equals , where  denotes the floor function (or equivalently ).\n\nIn September 2008, mathematicians at UCLA participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a Dell OptiPlex 745 on August 23, 2008.  This was the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA.\n\nOn April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is . Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a 48th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.\n\nOn January 19, 2016, Cooper published his discovery of a 49th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 22,338,618 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network. This was the fourth Mersenne prime discovered by Cooper and his team in the past ten years.\n\nOn January 3, 2018, it was announced that Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, had found a 50th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 23,249,425 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.\n\nTheorems about Mersenne numbers\n\n# If  and  are natural numbers such that  is prime, then  or .\n#* Proof: .

As a result, for all positive integers ,  is a factor of  if and only if  is a factor of . Therefore, since  is a factor of ,  is a factor of  so . Furthermore, since  is a factor of , which is odd,  is odd. Therefore, .\n#* Note: This fact provides a proof of Euclid's theorem, which asserts the infinitude of primes, distinct from the proof written by Euclid: for every odd prime , all primes dividing  are larger than ; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.\n#* Note: In conjunction with the next theorem below, certain multiples of  are impossible, namely when  is multiplied by twice an odd number. Thus for instance , , , and so forth cannot be factors of .

This leads to , which is impossible since .\n#If  and  are natural numbers then  and  are coprime if and only if  and  are coprime.

Hence, the former congruence must be true and  divides .\n# All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers pass the Fermat primality test for the base 2.\n\nList of known Mersenne primes\n\nThe table below lists all known Mersenne primes (sequence  () and  () in OEIS):\n\nAll Mersenne numbers below the 49th Mersenne prime () have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and the 31st. Similarly,  was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later.[http://www.mersenne.org/report_milestones/ GIMPS Milestones Report]. Retrieved 2018-01-27  was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million decimal digits.\n\nThe largest known Mersenne prime  is also the largest known prime number.\n\nIn modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.The largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime since 1952, except between 1989 and 1992; see Caldwell, \"[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History]\" from the Prime Pages website, University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\nFactorization of composite Mersenne numbers\n\nSince they are prime numbers, Mersenne primes are divisible only by 1 and by themselves.  However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored nontrivially.  Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the special number field sieve algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  , 2 − 1 is the record-holder,Thorsten Kleinjung, Joppe Bos, Arjen Lenstra \"Mersenne Factorization Factory\" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf having been factored with a variant of the special number field sieve that allows the factorization of several numbers at once.  See integer factorization records for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a primality test on the cofactor. , the largest factorization with probable prime factors allowed is , where  is a 1,577,600-digit probable prime.  , the Mersenne number M1277 is the smallest composite Mersenne number with no known factors; it has no prime factors below 265.\n\nThe table below shows factorizations for the first 20 composite Mersenne numbers .\n\nMersenne primitive part\n\nThe primitive part of Mersenne number  is , the th cyclotomic polynomial at 2, they are\n1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 3, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 57, 524287, 205, 2359, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... \n\nBesides, if we notice those prime factors, and delete \"old prime factors\", for example, 3 divides the 2nd, 6th, 18th, 54th, 162nd, ... terms of this sequence, we only allow the 2nd term divided by 3, if we do, they are\n1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 1, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 19, 524287, 41, 337, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... \n\nThe numbers  for which  is prime are\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 150, ... \n\nThe numbers  for which  has an only primitive prime factor are\n2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 54, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 147, 150, ...
