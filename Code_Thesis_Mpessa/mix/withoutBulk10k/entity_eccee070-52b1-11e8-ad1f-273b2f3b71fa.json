  "textBody" : "Edward Bellamy (March 26, 1850 – May 22, 1898) was an American author and socialist, most famous for his utopian novel, Looking Backward, a tale set in the distant future of the year 2000. Bellamy's vision of a harmonious future world inspired the formation of at least 165 \"Nationalist Clubs\" dedicated to the propagation of Bellamy's political ideas and working to make them a practical reality.Franklln Rosemont, \"Bellamy's Radicalism Reclaimed\", in Daphne Patai (ed.), Looking Backward, 1988-1888. Amherst MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; pg. 201.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nEdward Bellamy was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts. His father was Rufus King Bellamy (1816–1886), a Baptist minister and a descendant of Joseph Bellamy.Howard Quint, The Forging of American Socialism: Origins of the Modern Movement: The Impact of Socialism on American Thought and Action, 1886–1901. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1953; pg. 74. His mother, Maria Louisa Putnam Bellamy, was a Calvinist. She was the daughter of a Baptist minister named Benjamin Putnam, who was forced to withdraw from the ministry in Salem, Massachusetts, following objections to his becoming a Freemason.Joseph Schiffman, \"Edward Bellamy's Religious Thought\", Transactions and Proceedings of the Modern Language Association of America, vol. 68, no. 4 (Sep. 1953), pg. 716.\n\nBellamy attended public school at Chicopee Falls before leaving for Union College of Schenectady, New York, where he studied for just two semesters. Upon leaving school, Bellamy made his way to Europe for a year, spending extensive time in Germany. Bellamy briefly studied law but abandoned that field without ever having practiced as a lawyer, instead entering the world of journalism. In this capacity Bellamy briefly served on the staff of the New York Post before returning to his native Massachusetts to take a position at the Springfield Union.\n\nAt the age of 25, Bellamy developed tuberculosis, the disease that would ultimately kill him. He suffered with its effects throughout his adult life. In an effort to regain his health, Bellamy spent a year in the Hawaiian Islands (1877 to 1878). Returning to the United States, Bellamy decided to abandon the daily grind of journalism in favor of literary work, which put fewer demands upon his time and his health.\n\nBellamy married Emma Augusta Sanderson in 1882. The couple had two children.\n\nLiterary career\n\nBellamy's early novels, including Six to One (1878), Dr. Heidenhoff's Process (1880), and Miss Ludington's Sister (1885) were unremarkable works, making use of standard psychological plots.Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pp. 74–75.\n\nA turn to utopian science fiction with Looking Backward, 2000–1887, published in January 1888, captured the public imagination and catapulted Bellamy to literary fame. The publisher of the book could scarcely keep up with demand. Within a year the book had sold some 200,000 copies and by the end of the 19th century it had sold more copies than any other book published in America up to that time except for Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe and Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace.Arthur E. Morgan, Edward Bellamy. New York: Columbia University Press, 1944; pp. 148, 252. He also collected several short stories in 1898 and published The Duke of Stockbridge; a Romance of Shay's Rebellion in 1900.\n\nThe Bellamyite movement\n\nAlthough Bellamy retrospectively claimed he did not write Looking Backward as a blueprint for political action, but rather sought to write \"a literary fantasy, a fairy tale of social felicity\",Edward Bellamy, \"Why I Wrote Looking Backward,\" The Nationalist, vol. 2 (1890), pg. 199. the book inspired legions of inspired readers to establish so-called Nationalist Clubs, beginning in Boston late in 1888.William D.P. Bliss and Rudolph M. Binder (eds.), The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform. New Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1908; pp. 810–812. Bellamy's vision of a country relieved of its social ills through abandonment of the principle of competition and establishment of state ownership of industry proved an appealing panacea to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the dark side of Gilded Age America. By 1891 it was reported that no fewer than 162 Nationalist Clubs were in existence.Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. Fifth Revised and Enlarged Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 289.\n\nBellamy's use of the term \"Nationalism\" rather than \"socialism\" as a descriptor of his governmental vision was calculated, as he did not want to limit either sales of his novel or the potential influence of its political ideas.Sylvia E. Bowman, The Year 2000: A Critical Biography of Edward Bellamy. New York: Bookman Associates, 1958; pg. 114. In an 1888 letter to literary critic William Dean Howells, Bellamy wrote:\n\nBellamy himself came to actively participate in the political movement which emerged around his book, particularly after 1891 when he founded his own magazine, The New Nation, and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging People's Party.Arthur Lipow, Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1982; pg. 30. For the next three and a half years, Bellamy gave his all to politics, publishing his magazine, working to influence the platform of the People's Party, and publicizing the Nationalist movement in the popular press. This phase of Bellamy's life came to an end in 1894, when The New Nation was forced to suspend publication owing to financial difficulties.Lipow, Authoritarian Socialism in America, pg. 31.\n\nWith the key activists of the Nationalist Clubs largely absorbed into the apparatus of the People's Party (although a Nationalist Party did run candidates for office in Wisconsin as late as 1896[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1897 Casson, Henry, ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1897 Madison, 1897; pp. 656, 657, 663]), Bellamy abandoned politics for a return to literature. He set to work on a sequel to Looking Backward titled Equality, attempting to deal with the ideal society of the post-revolutionary future in greater detail. The book saw print in 1897 and would prove to be Bellamy's final creation.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nEdward Bellamy died of tuberculosis in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. He was 48 years old at the time of his death.\n\nHis lifelong home in Chicopee Falls, built by his father,\"[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3440239/a_noted_writers_abode_the_home_of/ A Noted Writer's Abode: The Home of Edward Bellamy at Chicopee Falls, Mass.]\", Harrisburg [PA] Telegraph, July 19, 1890, pg. 4. was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.\"[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId\n1070&ResourceType=Building Edward Bellamy House: National Historic Landmark summary listing]\", National Park Service, tps.cr.nps.gov/ \n\nBellamy was the cousin of Francis Bellamy, famous for creation of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nBellamy Road, a residential road in Toronto, is named for the author.\n\nBibliography\n\nNovels\n\n*Six to One (1878)\n*Dr. Heidenhoff's Process (1880)\n*Miss Ludington's Sister (1885)\n*Looking Backward, 2000–1887 (1888)\n*Equality (1897)\n*The Duke of Stockbridge; a Romance of Shay's Rebellion (1900)\n\nShort stories\n\n*\"At Pinney's Ranch\"\n*\"The Blindman's World\"\n*\"Deserted\"\n*\"An Echo Of Antietam\"\n*\"Hooking Watermelons\"\n*\"Lost\"\n*\"A Love Story Reversed\"\n*\"The Old Folks' Party\"\n*\"A Positive Romance\"\n*\"Potts's Painless Cure\"\n*\"A Summer Evening's Dream\"\n*\"To Whom This May Come\"\n*\"Two Days' Solitary Imprisonment\"\n*\"With The Eyes Shut\"",
