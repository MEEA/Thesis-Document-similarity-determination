  "textBody" : "A methyl group is an alkyl derived from methane, containing one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms — CH3. In formulas, the group is often abbreviated Me. Such hydrocarbon groups occur in many organic compounds. It is a very stable group in most molecules.  While the methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule, it can be found on its own in any of three forms: anion, cation or radical. The anion has eight valence electrons, the radical seven and the cation six. All three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed.\n\nMethyl cation, anion, and radical\n\nMethyl cation\n\nThe methylium cation (CH3+) exists in the gas phase, but is otherwise not encountered.  Some compounds are considered to be sources of the CH3+ cation, and this simplification is used pervasively in organic chemistry.  For example, protonation of methanol gives a strongly electrophilic methylating reagent:\nCH3OH + H+  →  CH3+ + H2O\n\nSimilarly, methyl iodide and methyl triflate are viewed as the equivalent of the methyl cation because they readily undergo SN2 reactions by weak nucleophiles.\n\nMethyl anion\n\nThe methanide anion (CH3−) exists only in rarefied gas phase or under exotic conditions. It can be produced by electrical discharge in ketene at low pressure (less than one torr) and its enthalpy of reaction is determined to be about 252.2±3.3 kJ/mol.G. Barney Ellison , P. C. Engelking , W. C. Lineberger (1978), \"An experimental determination of the geometry and electron affinity of methyl radical \" Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 100, issue 8, pages 2556–2558. \n\nIn discussions mechanisms of organic reactions, methyl lithium and related Grignard reagents are often considered to be salts of \"CH3−\"; and though the model may be useful for description and analysis, it is only a useful fiction. Such reagents are generally prepared from the methyl halides:\n2 M + CH3X → MCH3 + MX\nwhere M is an alkali metal.\n\nMethyl radical\n\nThe methyl radical has the formula CH3.  It exists in dilute gases, but in more concentrated form it readily dimerizes to ethane. It can be produced by thermal decomposition of only certain compounds, especially those with an -N=N- linkage.\n\nReactivity\n\nThe reactivity of a methyl group depends on the adjacent substituents.  Methyl groups can be quite unreactive.  For example, in organic compounds, the methyl group resists attack by even the strongest acids.\n\nOxidation\n\nThe oxidation of a methyl group occurs widely in nature and industry. The oxidation products derived from methyl are CH2OH, CHO, and CO2H.   For example, permanganate often converts a methyl group to a carboxyl (-COOH) group, e.g. the conversion of toluene to benzoic acid. Ultimately oxidation of methyl groups gives protons and carbon dioxide, as seen in combustion.\n\nMethylation\n\nDemethylation (the transfer of the methyl group to another compound) is a common process, and reagents that undergo this reaction are called methylating agents.  Common methylating agents are dimethyl sulfate, methyl iodide, and methyl triflate.  Methanogenesis, the source of natural gas, arises via a demethylation reaction.Thauer, R. K., \"Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson\", Microbiology, 1998, volume 144, pages 2377–2406.\n\nDeprotonation\n\nCertain methyl groups can be deprotonated. For example, the acidity of the methyl groups in acetone ((CH3)2CO) is about 1020 more acidic than methane. The resulting carbanions are key intermediates in many reactions in organic synthesis and biosynthesis.  Fatty acids are produced in this way.\n\nFree radical reactions\n\nWhen placed in benzylic or allylic positions, the strength of the C-H bond is decreased, and the reactivity of the methyl group increases.  One manifestation of this enhanced reactivity is the photochemical chlorination of the methyl group in toluene to give benzyl chloride.M. Rossberg et al. “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  \n\nChiral methyl\n\nIn the special case where one hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (D) and another hydrogen by tritium (T), the methyl substituent becomes chiral.  Methods exist to produce optically pure methyl compounds, e.g., chiral acetic acid (CHDTCO2H). Through the use of chiral methyl groups, the stereochemical course of several biochemical transformations have been analyzed.Heinz G. Floss, Sungsook Lee \"Chiral methyl groups: small is beautiful\" Acc. Chem. Res., 1993, volume 26, pp 116–122.\n\nEtymology\n\nFrench chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot, after determining methanol's chemical structure, introduced \"methylene\" from the Greek methy \"wine\" and hȳlē \"wood, patch of trees\" with the intention of highlighting its origins, \"alcohol made from wood (substance)\".J.
