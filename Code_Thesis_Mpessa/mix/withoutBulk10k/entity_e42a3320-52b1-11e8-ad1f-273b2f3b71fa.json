  "textBody" : "A duopoly (from Greek δύο, duo (two) + πωλεῖν, polein (to sell)) is a form of oligopoly where only two sellers exist in one market. In practice, the term is also used where two firms have dominant control over a market. It is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity.\n\nDuopoly models in economics and game theory\n\nThere are two principal duopoly models, Cournot duopoly and Bertrand duopoly:\n* The Cournot model, which shows that two firms assume each other's output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this.\n* The Bertrand model, in which, in a game of two firms, each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium.\n\nCharacteristics of duopoly \n\n# Existence of only two sellers\n# Independence\n# Presence of monopoly elements: so long products are differentiated, the firms enjoy some monopoly power, as each product will have some loyal customers\n# There are two popular modes of duopoly, i.e., Cournot’s Model and Chamberlain’s Model.\n\nPolitics\n\nModern American politics, in particular the electoral college system has been described as duopolistic since the Republican and Democratic parties have dominated and framed policy debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half. Third Parties have encountered various blocks in getting onto ballots at different levels of government as well as other electoral obstacles, such as denial of access to general election debates.\n\nExamples in business\n\nA commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving Visa and MasterCard, who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit.http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f1900/1973.htmhttp://mit.edu/thistle/www/v12/2/credit.html An appeal was upheld in 2004.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4014599.stm\n\nExamples where two companies control a large proportion of a market are:\n* Airbus and Boeing in the market for large commercial airplanes.
