  "textBody" : "Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. (page 56 in 1967 edition)\n\nAccording to the philosopher William L. Rowe, \"agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist\". Agnosticism is the doctrine or tenet of agnostics with regard to knowledge of a First Cause or God. and is not a religion.\n\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word \"agnostic\" in 1869.\nEarlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife;Bhaskar (1972). and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of \"the gods\". The Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe.\n\nDefining agnosticism\n\nBeing a scientist, above all else, Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic.Edward Zerin: Karl Popper On God: The Lost Interview. Skeptic 6:2 (1998) According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\n\nGeorge H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word,George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 9 and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word,George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 12 promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view of those who do not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).\n\nEtymology\n\nAgnostic () was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.\n\nEarly Christian church leaders used the Greek word gnosis (knowledge) to describe \"spiritual knowledge\". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of Gnosticism in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.\n\nHuxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical, evidence-based inquiry.\n\nIn recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean \"not knowable\".Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993\nIn technical and marketing literature, \"agnostic\" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, \"platform agnostic\"\n\nor \"hardware agnostic\".\n\nQualifying agnosticism\n\nScottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. tautologies such as \"all bachelors are unmarried\" or \"all triangles have three corners\").Hume, David, \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (1748)\n\nTypes\n\n;Strong agnosticism (also called \"hard\", \"closed\", \"strict\", or \"permanent agnosticism\"): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, \"I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you.\"\n\n;Weak agnosticism (also called \"soft\", \"open\", \"empirical\", or \"temporal agnosticism\"): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available. A weak agnostic would say, \"I don't know whether any deities exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is evidence, we can find something out.\"\n;Apathetic agnosticism: The view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.Rauch, Jonathan, Let It Be: Three Cheers for Apatheism, The Atlantic Monthly, May 2003\n\nHistory\n\nGreek philosophy\n\nAgnostic thought, in the form of skepticism, emerged as a formal philosophical position in ancient Greece. Its proponents included Protagoras, Pyrrho, Carneades, Sextus Empiricus\n\nand, to some degree, Socrates, who was a strong advocate for a skeptical approach to epistemology.\n\nPyrrho said that we should refrain from making judgment as we can never know the true reality. According to Pyrrho, having opinion was possible, but certainty and knowledge are impossible.\n\nCarneades was also a skeptic in relation to all knowledge claims. He proposed a probability theory, however.  According to him, certainty could never be attained. Protagoras rejected the conventional accounts of the gods. He said:\n\nHindu philosophy\n\nThroughout the history of Hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism.\n\nThe Rig Veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created. Nasadiya Sukta (Creation Hymn) in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda says:\n\nHume, Kant, and Kierkegaard\n\nAristotle,\n\nAnselm,\n\nAquinas,\n\nand Descartes\n\npresented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of David Hume, the antinomies of Immanuel Kant, and the existential philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.\n\nIn his 1844 book, Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard writes:Kierkegaard, Søren. Philosophical Fragments. Ch. 3\n\nHume was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him \"the Prince of Agnostics\".A Hundred Years of British Philosophy, By Rudolf Metz, pg. 111 Diderot wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the Baron D'Holbach, and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.\n\nCharles Darwin\n\nRaised in a religious environment, Charles Darwin studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be \"absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist\".[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 Letter 12041] – Darwin, C.

Though Huxley began to use the term \"agnostic\" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:\n\nAnd again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:\n\nOf the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:\n\nIn 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.\n\nRobert G. Ingersoll\n\nRobert G. Ingersoll, an Illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century America, has been referred to as the \"Great Agnostic\".\n\nIn an 1896 lecture titled Why I Am An Agnostic, Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:\n\nIn the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:\n\nWilliam Stewart Ross\n\nWilliam Stewart Ross wrote under the name of Saladin. He championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of Charles Bradlaugh as an open-ended spiritual exploration.Alastair Bonnett 'The Agnostic Saladin' History Today, 2013, 63,2, pp. 47–52\n\nIn Why I am an Agnostic (c. 1889) he claims that agnosticism is \"the very reverse of atheism\".\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nBertrand Russell's pamphlet, Why I Am Not a Christian, based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title, is considered a classic statement of agnosticism.\n\nHe calls upon his readers to \"stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence\".\n\nIn 1939, Russell gave a lecture on The existence and nature of God, in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:\n\nHowever, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:Collected Papers, Vol. 10, p.258\n\nIn Russell's 1947 pamphlet, Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? (subtitled A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:\n\nIn his 1953 essay, What Is An Agnostic? Russell states:\n\nLater in the essay, Russell adds:\n\nLeslie Weatherhead\n\nIn 1965 Christian theologian Leslie Weatherhead published The Christian Agnostic, in which he argues:\n\nAlthough radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's agnosticism falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of weak agnosticism:\n\nDemographics\n\nDemographic research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents, so agnostics are often classified in the same category as atheists or other non-religious people.\n\nA 2010 survey published in Encyclopædia Britannica found that the non-religious people or the agnostics made up about 9.6% of the world's population.\n\nA November–December 2006 poll published in the Financial Times gives rates for the United States and five European countries. The rates of agnosticism in the United States were at 14%, while the rates of agnosticism in the European countries surveyed were considerably higher: Italy (20%), Spain (30%), Great Britain (35%), Germany (25%), and France (32%).\n\nA study conducted by the Pew Research Center found that about 16% of the world's people, the third largest group after Christianity and Islam, have no religious affiliation.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report by the Pew Research Center, agnostics made up 3.3% of the US adult population.\n\nIn the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center, 55% of agnostic respondents expressed \"a belief in God or a universal spirit\",\n\nwhereas 41% stated that they thought that they felt a tension \"being non-religious in a society where most people are religious\".\n\nAccording to the 2011 Australian Bureau of Statistics, 22% of Australians have \"no religion\", a category that includes agnostics.\n\nBetween 64% and 65%\n\nof Japanese and up to 81%\n\nof Vietnamese are atheists, agnostics, or do not believe in a god. An official European Union survey reported that 3% of the EU population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit.\n\nCriticism\n\nAgnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.\n\nTheistic\n\nTheistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (etsi deus non-daretur), or as if God did exist (etsi deus daretur).\n\nReligious scholars such as Laurence B. Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics. Brown raises the question, \"You claim that nothing can be known with certainty ... how, then, can you be so sure?\"\n\nChristian\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth. He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.\n\n\"Agnosticism\", said Ratzinger, \"is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man ... The knowledge of God has always existed\". He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.\n\nThe Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls \"partial agnosticism\", specifically those systems that \"do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge\".\n However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican declares, \"God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation\".\n\nBlaise Pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as Pascal's Wager: the infinite expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer \"bet\" to choose God.\n\nPeter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli cited 20 arguments for God's existence,[http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God], from the Handbook of Christian Apologetics by Peter Kreeft and Fr. Ronald Tacelli, SJ, Intervarsity Press, 1994. [https://www.webcitation.org/6QhAxhgdF?urlhttp://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm Archived] from the original on June 29, 2014. asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking God, the supreme being, to become man's servant.\n\nAtheistic\n\nAccording to Richard Dawkins, a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, \"I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.\"The God Delusion (2006), Bantam Press, p. 51 Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; \"Temporary Agnostics in Practice\" (TAPs), and \"Permanent Agnostics in Principle\" (PAPs). He states that \"agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.\", and considers PAP a \"deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting\".The God Delusion (2006), Bantam Press, pp 47-48\n\nRelated concepts\n\nIgnosticism is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.\n\nA.J. Ayer, Theodore Drange, and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept \"a deity exists\" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.Ayer, Language, 115: \"There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God ... is even probable. ... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible.\"Drange, Atheism",

Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics. Brown raises the question, \"You claim that nothing can be known with certainty ... how, then, can you be so sure?\"\n\nChristian\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth. He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.\n\n\"Agnosticism\", said Ratzinger, \"is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man ... The knowledge of God has always existed\". He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.\n\nThe Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls \"partial agnosticism\", specifically those systems that \"do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge\".\n However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican declares, \"God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation\".\n\nBlaise Pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as Pascal's Wager: the infinite expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer \"bet\" to choose God.\n\nPeter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli cited 20 arguments for God's existence,[http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God], from the Handbook of Christian Apologetics by Peter Kreeft and Fr. Ronald Tacelli, SJ, Intervarsity Press, 1994.

About himself, Dawkins continues, \"I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.\"The God Delusion (2006), Bantam Press, p. 51 Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; \"Temporary Agnostics in Practice\" (TAPs), and \"Permanent Agnostics in Principle\" (PAPs). He states that \"agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.\", and considers PAP a \"deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting\".The God Delusion (2006), Bantam Press, pp 47-48\n\nRelated concepts\n\nIgnosticism is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.\n\nA.J. Ayer, Theodore Drange, and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept \"a deity exists\" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.Ayer, Language, 115: \"There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God ... is even probable. ... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible.\"Drange, Atheism. Agnosticism. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=894."
