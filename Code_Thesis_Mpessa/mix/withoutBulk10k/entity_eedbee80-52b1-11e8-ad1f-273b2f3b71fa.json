  "textBody" : "Europa Island () is a 28 km2 low-lying tropical atoll in the Mozambique Channel, about a third of the way from southern Madagascar to southern Mozambique. The island had never been inhabited until 1820, when the French family Rosier moved to it. The island officially became a possession of France in 1897. \n\nThe island, garrisoned by a detachment from Réunion, has a weather station and is visited by scientists.  Though uninhabited, it is part of the \"Scattered Islands\" of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands administrative region. \n\nEuropa Island was the setting of a 1968 episode of \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\", partly focusing on the breeding habits of the green sea turtle.\n\nDescription \n\nEuropa is 6 km in diameter, with a maximum altitude of 6 m, and has  of coastline. It is surrounded by coral beaches and a fringing reef and encloses a mangrove lagoon of around 9 km2 and open to the sea on one side. \n\nThere are no ports or harbours but anchorage is possible offshore.  Its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), contiguous with that of Bassas da India, is 127300 km2.  The airstrip is 1500 m metres long.\n\nEcology\n\nThe island is a nature reserve.  Its vegetation consists of dry forest, scrub, euphorbia, the mangrove swamp, and the remains of a sisal plantation.  It is one of the world's largest nesting sites for green sea turtles. It is also home to goats introduced by settlers in the late 18th century.\n\nThe island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large and diverse population of breeding seabirds and other waterbirds.  It is the only known breeding site outside Aldabra and Madagascar for Malagasy pond herons. Seabirds include the second largest colony in the western Indian Ocean of great frigatebirds (with up to 1100 pairs), Audubon's shearwaters (up to 100 pairs, probably of the subspecies Puffinus lherminieri bailloni previously considered endemic to the Mascarene Islands), dimorphic egrets and Caspian terns.  \n\nThe island is also home to an endemic subspecies of white-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus europae).
