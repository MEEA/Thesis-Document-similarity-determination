  "textBody" : "In Norse mythology, Brísingamen (or Brísinga men) is the torc or necklace of the goddess Freyja.Bellows, Henry Adams (Trans.) The Poetic Edda, Princeton University Press, 1936. p. 158. The name is an Old Norse compound brísinga-men whose second element is men \"(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc\".Faulkes, Anthony and Barnes, Michael (compilers) A New Introduction to Old Norse. Part III: Glossary and Index of Names. Fourth ed. Viking Society for Northern Research, 2007. The etymology of the first element is uncertain. It has been derived from Old Norse brísingr, a poetic term for \"fire\" or \"amber\" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (þulur) appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda,Vigfusson, Gudbrand and Powell, F. York (eds. & trans.) Corpus Poeticum Boreale: The Poetry of the Old Northern Tongue.  Vol. II: Court Poetry. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1883. p. 435, l. 534. making Brísingamen \"gleaming torc\", \"sunny torc\", or the like. However, Brísingr can also be an ethnonym, in which case Brísinga men is \"torque of the Brísings\"; the Old English parallel in Beowulf supports this derivation, though who the Brísings (Old Norse Brísingar) may have been remains unknown.Lindow, John. Handbook of Norse Mythology. ABC-CLIO, 2001, s.v. Brísinga men.\n\nAttestations\n\nBeowulf\n\nBrísingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf as Brosinga mene. The brief mention in Beowulf is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977):\n\nThis seems to confuse two different stories as the Beowulf  poet is clearly referring to the legends about Theoderic the Great. The Þiðrekssaga tells that the warrior Heime (Háma in Old English) takes sides against Ermanaric (\"Eormanric\"), king of the Goths, and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace. Possibly the Beowulf poet was confused, or invented the addition of the necklace to give him an excuse to drag in a mention of Eormanric. In any case, the necklace given to Beowulf in the story is not the Brísingamen itself; it is only being compared to it.\n\nPoetic Edda\n\nIn the poem Þrymskviða of the Poetic Edda, Þrymr, the king of the jǫtnar, steals Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. Freyja lends Loki her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that Þrymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the Æsir’s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Brísingamen breaks off from her neck. Later Thor borrows Brísingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at Jǫtunheimr.\n\nThis myth is also recorded in an 18th-century Swedish folksong called Hammar-Hemtningen (the taking of the hammer), where Freyja is called Miss Frojenborg, \"den väna solen\" (the fair sun).[http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Hammar-Hemtningen_II Hammar-Hemtningen (Swedish)]\n\nProse Edda\n\nHúsdrápa, a skaldic poem partially preserved in the Prose Edda, relates the story of the theft of Brísingamen by Loki. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Brísingamen missing, she enlists the help of Heimdallr to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be Loki who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki. After a lengthy battle at Singasteinn, Heimdallr wins and returns Brísingamen to Freyja.\n\nSnorri Sturluson quoted this old poem in Skáldskaparmál, saying that because of this legend Heimdall is called \"Seeker of Freyja's Necklace\" (Skáldskaparmál, section 8) and Loki is called \"Thief of Brísingamen\" (Skáldskaparmál, section 16). A similar story appears in the later Sörla þáttr, where Heimdallr does not appear.\n\nSörla þáttr\n\nSörla þáttr is a short story in the later and extended version of the Saga of Olaf TryggvasonThe Younger Edda. Rasmus B. Anderson transl. (1897) Chicago: Scott, Foresman & Co. (1901). in the manuscript of the Flateyjarbók, which was written and compiled by two Christian priests, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in the late 14th century.Rasmus B. Anderson, Introduction to the Flatey Book. Norrœna Society, London (1908). \"The priest Jon Thordson wrote the story of Erik Vidforle and both the Olaf Sagas; but the priest Magnus Thorhalson wrote what follows and also what goes before, and revised the whole, thus dedicating the work: \"May God Almighty and the Virgin Mary bless both the one that wrote and the one that dictated!\" In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until Ragnarök.\n\nThe battle of Högni and Heðinn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the skaldic poem Ragnarsdrápa, Skáldskaparmál (section 49), and Gesta Danorum: king Högni's daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king Heðinn. When Högni comes to fight Heðinn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of Heðinn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and Hildr resurrects the fallen to make them fight until Ragnarök. None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who Christianized Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.\n\nArchaeological record\n\nA pagan völva was buried  with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.Harrison, D. & Svensson, K. (2007). Vikingaliv. Fälth & Hässler, Värnamo.  p.58\n\nModern influence\n\nAlan Garner wrote a children's fantasy novel called The Weirdstone of Brisingamen about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.\n\nDiana Paxson's novel Brisingamen features Freyja and her bracelet.\n\nBlack Phoenix Alchemy Lab has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.\n\nFreyja's necklace Brisingamen features prominently in Betsy Tobin's novel Iceland, where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion includes a treasure called the Nauglamír, which was made by the dwarves of Eriador for the elvish king Finrod Felagund. However, the necklace was brought out a dragon's hoard by Túrin Turambar and given to King Thingol of Doriath. This king asks a group of dwarves to set a Silmaril into the necklace for his wife Melian to wear. The dwarves fall under the spell of the Silmaril and they claim the Nauglamir as their own – with the Silmaril attached. They kill Thingol and make off with the necklace. It is eventually recovered and is an heirloom of Thingol's descendants, eventually leading Eärendil to Valinor and resulting in the return of the Valar into the affairs of Middle-earth. This is clearly intended to be the equivalent in his mythology to the Brísingamen.\n\nIn Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, the word \"brisingr\" means fire. This is probably a distillation of the word brisinga.\n\nUrsula Le Guin's short story Semley's Necklace, the first part of her novel Rocannon's World, is a retelling of the Brisingamen story on an alien planet. \n\nBrisingamen is represented as a card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, \"Nordic Relic Brisingamen\".\n\nBrisingamen was part of MMORPG Ragnarok Online lore, which is ranked as \"God item\". The game is heavily based from Norse mythology.\n\nIn the Firefly Online Game, one of the planets of the Himinbjörg system (which features planets named after figures from Germanic mythology) is named Brisingamen.  It is third from the star, and has moons named Freya, Beowulf, and Alberich.\n\nThe Brisingamen is an item that can be found and equipped in the game Castlevania: Lament of Innocence.",
