  "textBody" : "A heterocyclic compound or ring structure is a cyclic compound that has atoms of at least two different elements as members of its ring(s).IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02798.html heterocyclic compounds] Heterocyclic chemistry is the branch of organic chemistry dealing with the synthesis, properties, and applications of these heterocycles. \n\nExamples of heterocyclic compounds include all of the nucleic acids, the majority of drugs, most biomass (cellulose and related materials), and many natural and synthetic dyes.\n\nClassification \n\nAlthough heterocyclic chemical compounds may be inorganic compounds or organic compounds, most contain at least one carbon. While atoms that are neither carbon nor hydrogen are normally referred to in organic chemistry as heteroatoms, this is usually in comparison to the all-carbon backbone. But this does not prevent a compound such as borazine (which has no carbon atoms) from being labelled \"heterocyclic\". IUPAC recommends the Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature for naming heterocyclic compounds.\n\nHeterocyclic compounds can be usefully classified based on their electronic structure.  The saturated heterocycles behave like the acyclic derivatives.  Thus, piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are conventional amines and ethers, with modified steric profiles.  Therefore, the study of heterocyclic chemistry focuses especially on unsaturated derivatives, and the preponderance of work and applications involves unstrained 5- and 6-membered rings.  Included are pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan.  Another large class of heterocycles are fused to benzene rings, which for pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan are quinoline, benzothiophene, indole, and benzofuran, respectively.  Fusion of two benzene rings gives rise to a third large family of compounds, respectively the acridine, dibenzothiophene, carbazole, and dibenzofuran.  The unsaturated rings can be classified according to the participation of the heteroatom in the conjugated system, pi system.\n\n3-membered rings \n\nHeterocycles with three atoms in the ring are more reactive because of ring strain. Those containing one heteroatom are, in general, stable. Those with two heteroatoms are more likely to occur as reactive intermediates.\nCommon 3-membered heterocycles with one heteroatom are:\n\nThose with two heteroatoms include:\n\n4-membered rings \n\nCompounds with one heteroatom:\n\nCompounds with two heteroatoms:\n\n5-membered rings \n\nWith heterocycles containing five atoms, the unsaturated compounds are frequently more stable because of aromaticity.\n\nFive-membered rings with one heteroatom:\n\nThe 5-membered ring compounds containing two heteroatoms, at least one of which is nitrogen, are collectively called the azoles.  Thiazoles and isothiazoles contain a sulfur and a nitrogen atom in the ring.  Dithiolanes have two sulfur atoms.\n\nA large group of 5-membered ring compounds with three heteroatoms also exists. One example is dithiazoles that contain two sulfur and a nitrogen atom.\n\nFive-member ring compounds with four heteroatoms:\n\nWith 5-heteroatoms, the compound may be considered inorganic rather than heterocyclic. \n\n6-membered rings \n\nSix-membered rings with a single heteroatom:\n\nWith two heteroatoms:\n\nWith three heteroatoms:\n\nWith four heteroatoms:\n\nWith five heteroatoms:\n\nThe hypothetical compound with six nitrogen heteroatoms would be hexazine.\n\n7-membered rings \n\nWith 7-membered rings, the heteroatom must be able to provide an empty pi orbital (e.g., boron) for \"normal\" aromatic stabilization to be available; otherwise, homoaromaticity may be possible.  Compounds with one heteroatom include:\n\nThose with two heteroatoms include:\n\n8-membered rings \n\n9-membered rings \n\nImages \n\nNames in italics are retained by IUPAC and they do not follow the Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature\n\nFused rings \n\nHeterocyclic rings systems that are formally derived by fusion with other rings, either carbocyclic or heterocyclic, have a variety of common and systematic names.  For example, with the benzo-fused unsaturated nitrogen heterocycles, pyrrole provides indole or isoindole depending on the orientation.  The pyridine analog is quinoline or isoquinoline.  For azepine, benzazepine is the preferred name.  Likewise, the compounds with two benzene rings fused to the central heterocycle are carbazole, acridine, and dibenzoazepine. Thienothiophene are the fusion of two thiophene rings. Phosphaphenalenes are a tricylic phosphorus-containing heterocyclic system derived from the carbocycle phenalene.\n\nHistory of heterocyclic chemistry \n\nThe history of heterocyclic chemistry began in the 1800s, in step with the development of organic chemistry.
