  "textBody" : "Eden Phillpotts (4 November 1862 – 29 December 1960) was an English author, poet and dramatist. He was born in Mount Abu, India, was educated in Plymouth, Devon, and worked as an insurance officer for 10 years before studying for the stage and eventually becoming a writer.\n\nLife\n\nEden Phillpotts was a great-nephew of Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter. His father Henry Phillpotts was a son of the bishop’s younger brother Thomas Phillpotts. James Surtees Phillpotts the reforming headmaster of Bedford School was his second cousin.Phillpotts Genealogy, Percy Phillpotts, 1910 (manuscript in family possession)\n\nEden Phillpotts was born on 4 November 1862 at Mount Abu in Rajasthan. His father Henry was an officer in the Indian Army, while his mother Adelaide was the daughter of an Indian Civil Service officer posted in Madras, George Jenkins Waters.Dictionary of National Biography, article by Thomas Moult\n\nHenry Phillpotts died in 1866, leaving Adelaide a widow at the age of 21. With her three small sons, of whom Eden was the eldest, she returned to England and settled in Plymouth.Eden Phillpotts, From the Angle of 88, 1952\n\nPhillpotts was educated at Mannamead School in Plymouth. At school he showed no signs of a literary bent. In 1879, aged 17, he left home and went to London to earn his living. He found a job as a clerk with the Sun Fire Office.\n\nPhillpotts’ ambition was to be an actor and he attended evening classes at a drama school for two years. He came to the conclusion that he would never make a name as an actor but might have success as a writer. In his spare time out of office hours he proceeded to create a stream of small works which he was able to sell. In due course he left the insurance company to concentrate on his writing, while also working part-time as assistant editor for the weekly Black and White Magazine.\n\nEden Phillpotts maintained a steady output of three or four books a year for the next half century. He produced poetry, short stories, novels, plays and mystery tales. Many of his novels were about rural Devon life and some of his plays were distinguished by their effective use of regional dialect.\n\nEden Phillpotts died at his home in Broadclyst near Exeter, Devon, on 29 December 1960.\n\nPersonality\n\nPhillpotts was for many years the President of the Dartmoor Preservation Association and cared passionately about the conservation of Dartmoor.  He was an agnostic and a supporter of the Rationalist Press Association.\"...among the honorary associates of the [Rationalist Press] Association, past and present, are distinguished names such as...Eden Phillpotts.\" Quoted in Lord Snell, Men, Movements And Myself (p. 156), J.M. Dent and Sons, 1936.\n\nPhillpotts was a friend of Agatha Christie, who was an admirer of his work and a regular visitor to his home. Jorge Luis Borges was another admirer.Jorge Luis Borges: Conversations. University Press of Mississippi, 1998. Page 218. Borges mentioned him numerous times, wrote at least two reviews of his novels, and included him in his \"Personal Library\", a collection of works selected to reflect his personal literary preferences.\n\nPhilpotts appears to have had a long incestuous relationship with his daughter Adelaide. In a 1976 interview for a book about her father, Adelaide describes an incestuous relationship with him that she says lasted from the age of five or six until her early thirties, when he remarried. When she herself finally married at the age of 55 her father never forgave her, and never communicated with her again.James Y. Dayananda, ‘Phillpotts , (Mary) Adelaide Eden (1896–1993)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2012 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49176, accessed 9 May 2017]\n\nWritings\n\nPhillpotts wrote a great many books with a Dartmoor setting. One of his novels, Widecombe Fair, inspired by an annual fair at the village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor, provided the scenario for his comic play The Farmer's Wife. It went on to become a silent movie of the same name, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and filmed in 1927. (The cast included Jameson Thomas, Lillian Hall-Davis, Gordon Harker and Gibb McLaughlin.)\n\nHe co-wrote several plays with his daughter Adelaide Phillpotts, The Farmer's Wife (1924) and Yellow Sands (1926);I. Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 735 she later claimed their relationship was incestuous. Eden is best known as the author of many novels, plays and poems about Dartmoor. His Dartmoor cycle of 18 novels and two volumes of short stories still has many avid readers despite the fact that many titles are out of print.\n\nPhilpotts also wrote a series of novels, each set against the background of a different trade or industry. Titles include: Brunel's Tower (a pottery) and Storm in a Teacup (hand-papermaking). Among his other works is The Grey Room, the plot of which is centered on a haunted room in an English manor house. He also wrote a number of other mystery novels, both under his own name and the pseudonym Harrington Hext. These include: The Thing at Their Heels, The Red Redmaynes, The Monster, The Clue from the Stars, and The Captain's Curio. The Human BoyPhilpotts, Eden; The Human Boy; Pub: Harper & Brothers, 1899. was a collection of schoolboy stories in the same genre as Rudyard Kipling's Stalky & Co., though different in mood and style. Late in his long writing career he wrote a few books of interest to science fiction and fantasy readers, the most noteworthy being Saurus, which involves an alien reptilian observing human life.\n\nEric Partridge praised the immediacy and impact of his dialect writing.Eric Partridge, Usage and Abusage (1964) p. 96\n\nPhotographs\n\nPostbridge Clapper Bridge 2005-07-21.jpg|The clapper bridge at Postbridge, which is the central location of Phillpotts' novel The Thief of Virtue.\n\nWorks\n\nNovels\n*The End of a Life (1891)\n*Folly and Fresh Air (1891)\n*A Tiger's Club (1892)\n*[https://archive.org/details/adealwithdevil00philgoog A Deal with the Devil] (1895)\n*[https://archive.org/details/someeverydayfol00philgoog Some Every-day Folks] (1895)\n*[https://archive.org/details/mylaughingphilo00philgoog My Laughing Philosopher] (1896)\n*[https://archive.org/details/downdartmoorway00philgoog Down Dartmoor Way] (1896)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id9tE_AQAAIAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Lying Prophets: A Novel] (1897)\n*Children of the Mist (1898)\n*Sons of the Morning (1900)\n* [https://archive.org/details/goodredearth00philgoog The Good Red Earth] (1901)\n*The River (1902)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id-f8nAAAAMAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Old Delabole] (1903)\n*[https://archive.org/details/goldenfetich00philgoog The Golden Fetich] (1903)\n*The American Prisoner (1904)\n*[https://archive.org/details/farmdagger00philgoog The Farm of the Dagger] (1904)\n*The Secret Woman (1905)\n*The Poacher's Wife (1906) AKA Daniel Sweetland (1906)\n*The Sinews of War: A Romance of London and the Sea (1906) with Arnold Bennett\n*Doubloons (1906) with Arnold Bennett\n*The Portreeve (1906)\n*The Whirlwind (1907)\n* [https://archive.org/details/mother00philgoog The Mother] (1908)\n* The Virgin in Judgment (1908) AKA A Fight to Finish (1911)\n* [https://archive.org/details/statueastoryint00benngoog The Statue: A Story of International Intrigue and Mystery] (1908) with Arnold Bennett\n*[https://archive.org/stream/threebrothers01philgoog#page/n12/mode/2up The Three Brothers] (1909)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?idGsw5AQAAMAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse The Fun of the Fair] (1909)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?idduYWAAAAYAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse The Haven] (1909)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?idlUrTAAAAMAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse The Flint Heart: A Fairy Story] (1910)\n*The Thief of Virtue (1910)\n*The Beacon (1911)\n*[https://archive.org/details/demetersdaughte01philgoog Demeter's Daughter] (1911)\n*The Three Knaves (1912)\n*The Forest on the Hill (1912)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/loversromance00philuoft#page/n9/mode/2up The Lovers: A Romance] (1912)\n*Widecombe Fair (1913)\n*[https://archive.org/details/joyyouth01philgoog The Joy of Youth] (1913)\n*[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?idmdp.39015063947231;view\n1up;seq=9 The Old Time Before Them] (1913)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?idJ0Q1AAAAMAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_ge_summary_r&cad\n0#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Faith Tresilion] (1914)\n*The Master of Merripit (1914)\n*Brunel's Tower (1915)\n*[https://archive.org/details/greenalleysacom00philgoog The Green Alleys: A Comedy] (1916)\n*The Banks of Colne: (the Nursery) (1917)\n*The Girl and the Faun (1917)\n*[https://archive.org/details/spinners00philgoog The Spinners] (1918)\n* [https://archive.org/details/fromanglesevent00philgoog From the Angle of Seventeen] (1912)\n*Evander (1919)\n*[https://archive.org/details/storminateacup01philgoog Storm in a Teacup] (1919)\n*Miser's Money (1920)\n* [https://archive.org/details/eudociaacomedyr00philgoog Eudocia] (1921)\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1577/1577-h/1577-h.htm The Grey Room] (1921)\n*The Bronze Venus (1921)\n*Orphan Dinah (1920)\n* [https://archive.org/details/redredmaynes00philuoft The Red Redmaynes] (1922)\n*Pan and the Twins (1922)\n* [https://archive.org/details/number00philgoog Number 87] (1922)\n* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?iduc1.$b307410;view\n1up;seq=9 The Thing at Their Heels] (1923)\n*Cheat-the-boys; a Story of the Devonshire Orchards (1924)\n*Redcliff (1924)\n*The Treasures of Typhon (1924)\n*The Lavender Dragon (1924)\n*Who Killed Diana?

His Dartmoor cycle of 18 novels and two volumes of short stories still has many avid readers despite the fact that many titles are out of print.\n\nPhilpotts also wrote a series of novels, each set against the background of a different trade or industry. Titles include: Brunel's Tower (a pottery) and Storm in a Teacup (hand-papermaking). Among his other works is The Grey Room, the plot of which is centered on a haunted room in an English manor house. He also wrote a number of other mystery novels, both under his own name and the pseudonym Harrington Hext. These include: The Thing at Their Heels, The Red Redmaynes, The Monster, The Clue from the Stars, and The Captain's Curio.
