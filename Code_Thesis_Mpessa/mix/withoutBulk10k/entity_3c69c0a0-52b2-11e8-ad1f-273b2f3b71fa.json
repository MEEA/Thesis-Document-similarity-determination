  "textBody" : "Michael Edward Palin  (pronounced; born 5 May 1943) is an English comedian, actor, writer and television presenter.  He was a member of the comedy group Monty Python and later made a number of travel documentaries.\n\nPalin wrote most of his comedic material with fellow Python member Terry Jones. Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the Ken Dodd Show, The Frost Report, and Do Not Adjust Your Set. Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including \"Argument Clinic\", \"Dead Parrot sketch\", \"The Lumberjack Song\", \"The Spanish Inquisition\", \"Bicycle Repair Man\" and \"The Fish-Slapping Dance\".\n\nPalin continued to work with Jones after Python, co-writing Ripping Yarns. He has also appeared in several films directed by fellow Python Terry Gilliam and made notable appearances in other films such as A Fish Called Wanda (1988), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In a 2005 poll to find The Comedians' Comedian, he was voted the 30th favourite by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[https://movies.yahoo.com/person/michael-palin/ Michael Palin Biography] Yahoo.com. Retrieved 7 May 2012\n\nAfter Python, he began a new career as a travel writer and travel documentarian. His journeys have taken him across the world, including the North and South Poles, the Sahara Desert, the Himalayas, Eastern Europe and Brazil. In 2000 Palin was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to television. From 2009 to 2012 Palin was the president of the Royal Geographical Society.[http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/People/People.htm People & Staff]  Royal Geographical Society. Retrieved 24 June 2012 On 12 May 2013, Palin was made a BAFTA fellow, the highest honour that is conferred by the organisation.\n\nEarly life\n\nPalin was born in Ranmoor, Sheffield, the second child and only son of Edward Moreton Palin (1900-1977). and Mary Rachel Lockhart, née Ovey (1903-1990). His father was a Shrewsbury School and Cambridge University-educated engineer working for a steel firm. His maternal grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Lockhart Ovey, DSO, was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1927.The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons, p. 31 He started his education at Birkdale Preparatory School, Sheffield, and later Shrewsbury School. His sister Angela was nine years older than he was. Despite the age gap the two had a close relationship until her suicide in 1987. He has ancestral roots in Letterkenny, County Donegal.\n\nWhen he was five years old, Palin had his first acting experience at Birkdale playing Martha Cratchit in a school performance of A Christmas Carol. At the age of 10, Palin, still interested in acting, made a comedy monologue and read a Shakespeare play to his mother while playing all the parts.Ross, 200 After his school days in 1962 he went on to read modern history at Brasenose College, Oxford. With fellow student Robert Hewison he performed and wrote, for the first time, comedy material at a university Christmas party.[http://www.acornmedia.com/rippingyarns/MEP_Bio.htm Michael Palin biography]  Terry Jones, also a student in Oxford, saw that performance and began writing together with Hewison and Palin. In the same year Palin joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society Players and first gained fame when he won an acting award at a Co-op drama festival. He also performed and wrote in the Oxford Revue (called the Et ceteras) with Jones.Desert Island Discs, Radio 4, Sat 17 November 1979 – http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/b74f8680#p009mwvb\n\nIn 1966 he married Helen Gibbins, whom he first had met in 1959 on holiday in Southwold in Suffolk. This meeting was later fictionalised in Palin's play East of Ipswich.Ross, 57 The couple have three children (Thomas (b. 1969), William (b. 1971) and Rachel (b. 1975) and two grandchildren. Rachel is a BBC TV director, whose work includes MasterChef: The Professionals, shown on BBC2 throughout October and November 2010. A photograph of William as a baby briefly appeared in Monty Python and the Holy Grail as \"Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film\". His nephew is the theatre designer Jeremy Herbert.\n\nEarly career\n\nAfter finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called Now! for the television contractor Television Wales and the West. At the same time Palin was contacted by Jones, who had left university a year earlier, for assistance in writing a theatrical documentary about sex through the ages. Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various BBC programmes, such as The Ken Dodd Show, The Billy Cotton Bandshow, and The Illustrated Weekly Hudd. They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of writers working for The Frost Report, whose other members included Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Monty Python members Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, The Frost Report was the first time all the British members of Monty Python (its sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was at that time an American citizen) worked together. During the run of The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring John Bird: The Late Show and A series of Bird's. For A series of Bird's the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.\n\nFollowing The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team worked both as actors and writers on the show Twice a Fortnight with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, and the successful children's comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set with Idle and David Jason. The show also featured musical numbers by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, including future Monty Python musical collaborator Neil Innes. The animations for Do Not Adjust Your Set were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with PalinRoss, 91 sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in How to Irritate People together with Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for The Complete and Utter History of Britain.\n\nMonty Python\n\nOn the strength of their work on The Frost Report and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, among them Chapman's reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become Monty Python's Flying Circus. At the same time the success of Do Not Adjust Your Set had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, John Chapman, David Sherlock, Bob McCabe; Thomas Dunne Books; 2003\n\nIn Monty Python, Palin played various roles, which ranged from manic enthusiasm (such as the lumberjack of the Lumberjack Song, or Herbert Anchovy, host of the game show \"Blackmail\") to unflappable calmness (such as the Dead parrot vendor, Cheese Shop proprietor, or Postal Clerk). As a straight man he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits quietly as a marriage counsellor (Eric Idle) makes love to his wife (Carol Cleveland), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who wants to become a lion tamer. He also appeared as the \"It's\" man at the beginning of most episodes.\n\nPalin frequently co-wrote sketches with Terry Jones and also initiated the \"Spanish Inquisition sketch\", which included the catchphrase \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!\"\nHe also composed songs with Jones including \"The Lumberjack Song\", \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" and \"Spam\". His solo musical compositions included \"Decomposing Composers\" and \"Finland\".[http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82483 Monty Python Sings – Monty Python: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards: AllMusic]\n\nOther work\n\nAfter the Monty Python television series ended in 1974, the Palin/Jones team worked on Ripping Yarns, an intermittent television comedy series broadcast over three years from 1976. They had earlier collaborated on the play Secrets from the BBC series Black and Blue in 1973. He starred as Dennis the Peasant in Terry Gilliam's 1977 film Jabberwocky. Palin also appeared in All You Need Is Cash (1978) as Eric Manchester (based on Derek Taylor), the press agent for the Rutles. In 1980, Palin co-wrote Time Bandits with Terry Gilliam. He also acted in the film.\n\nIn 1982, Palin wrote and starred in The Missionary, co-starring Maggie Smith. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortescue, who is recalled from Africa to aid prostitutes. He co-starred with Maggie Smith again in the 1984 comedy film A Private Function. In 1984, he reunited with Terry Gilliam to appear in Brazil. He appeared in the comedy film A Fish Called Wanda, for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make Fierce Creatures. After filming for Fierce Creatures finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of Fierce Creatures had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot.\n\nUntil \"The Death of Stalin\" in 2017, and with the exception of several made-for-TV films and voice work for animations, Palin's last film role was a small part in The Wind in the Willows, a film directed by and starring Terry Jones. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, The Human Face. Palin was in the cast of You've Got Mail, the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy as a subplot novelist, but his role was eventually cut entirely. He also assisted Campaign for Better Transport and others with campaigns on sustainable transport, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has been president of the campaign since 1986.[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin Campaign for Better Transport website] \n\nPalin has also appeared in serious drama. In 1991 Palin worked as producer and actor in the film American Friends based upon a real event in the life of his great grandfather, a fellow at St John's College, Oxford. In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's Channel 4 drama series GBH.\n\nPalin also had a small cameo role in Australian soap opera Home and Away. He played an English surfer with a fear of sharks, who interrupts a conversation between two main characters to ask whether there were any sharks in the sea. This was filmed while he was in Australia for the Full Circle series, with a segment about the filming of the role featuring in the series. In November 2005, he appeared in the John Peel's Record Box documentary.[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 \"John Peel's Record Box\"], 2005\n\nIn 2013 Michael Palin appeared in a First World War drama titled The Wipers Times written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was announced that Palin was set to star alongside Adam Driver in Terry Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.Skinner, Craig (2016). [http://www.flickreel.com/terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-to-star-adam-driver-and-michael-palin-new-concept-art-uncovered/ EXCLUSIVE: TERRY GILLIAM’S THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE TO STAR ADAM DRIVER AND MICHAEL PALIN; NEW CONCEPT ART UNCOVERED], Flickreel.com, 11 May 2016 Palin, however, dropped out of the film after it ran into a financial problem.\n\nActivism\n\nIn July 2010, Palin sent a message of support for the Dongria Kondh tribe of India, who are resisting mining on their land by the company Vedanta Resources. Palin said, \"I've been to the Nyamgiri Hills in Orissa and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government. The tribe I visited simply want to carry on living in the villages that they and their ancestors have always lived in\".[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6269 Michael Palin sends message to support Dongria Kondh], Survival International\n\nOn 2 January 2011, Palin became the first person to sign the UK-based Campaign for Better Transport's Fair Fares Now campaign. In July 2015, Palin signed an open letter and gave an interview to support \"a strong BBC at the centre of British life\" at a time the government was reviewing the corporation's size and activities.\n\nTelevision documentaries\n\nTravel\n\nPalin's first travel documentary was segment 4 of the 1980 BBC Television series Great Railway Journeys of the World, entitled Confessions of a Trainspotter.  Throughout the hour long show, Palin humorously reminisces about his childhood hobby of train spotting, while he travels throughout the UK by train, from London to the Kyle of Lochalsh, via Manchester, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Inverness. He rides vintage train lines and trains including Flying Scotsman.  At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the station's long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.\n\nIn 1994, Palin travelled through Ireland for the same series, entitled \"Derry to Kerry\". In a quest for family roots, he attempted to trace his great grandmother – Brita Gallagher – who set sail from Ireland  years ago during the Great Famine (1845–1849), bound for a new life in Burlington, New Jersey. The series is a trip along the Palin family line.\n\nStarting in 1989, Palin appeared as presenter in a series of travel programmes made for the BBC. It was after the veteran TV globetrotter Alan Whicker and journalist Miles Kington turned down presenting the first of these, Around the World in 80 Days, that gave Palin the opportunity to present his first and subsequent travel shows. These programmes have been broadcast around the world in syndication, and were also sold on VHS tape and later on DVD:\n\n* Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days (Travel 1988; Programme release 1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous Jules Verne story without using aircraft.\n* Pole to Pole (Travel 1991; Programme release 1992): travelling from the North Pole to the South Pole, following as closely as possible the 30-degree line of longitude, over as much land as possible, i.e., through Europe and Africa.\n* Full Circle with Michael Palin (Travel 1995/96; Programme release 1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the Pacific Ocean anti-clockwise; a journey of almost 50000 mi starting on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait and taking him through Asia, Oceania and the Americas.\n* Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure (1999): retracing the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway through the United States, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.\n* Sahara with Michael Palin (Travel 2001/02; Programme release 2002): in which he trekked around and through the world's largest desert.\n* Himalaya with Michael Palin (Travel 2003/04; Programme release 2004): in which he travels through the Himalaya region.\n* Michael Palin's New Europe (Travel 2006/07; Programme release 2007): in which he travels through Central and Eastern Europe.\n* Brazil with Michael Palin (2012) in which he travels through Brazil.\n\nFollowing each trip, Palin wrote a book about his travels, providing information and insights not included in the TV programme. Each book is illustrated with photographs by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was on the team. (Exception: the first book, Around the World in 80 Days, contains some pictures by Pao but most are by other photographers.)\n\nAll seven of these books were also made available as audio books, and all of them are read by Palin himself. Around the World in 80 Days and Hemingway Adventure are unabridged, while the other four books were made in both abridged and unabridged versions, although the unabridged versions can be very difficult to find.\n\nFor four of the trips a photography book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.\n\nPalin's travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the \"Palin effect\": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions – for example, the significant increase in the number of tourists interested in Peru after Palin visited Machu Picchu. In a 2006 survey of \"15 of the world's top travel writers\" by The Observer, Palin named Peru's Pongo de Mainique (canyon below the Machu Picchu) his \"favourite place in the world\".\n\nPalin notes in his book of Around the World in 80 Days that the final leg of his journey could originally have taken him and his crew on one of the trains involved in the Clapham Junction rail crash, but they arrived ahead of schedule and caught an earlier train.\n\nArt and history\n\nIn recent years, Palin has written and presented occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on Scottish painter Anne Redpath, was Palin on Redpath in 1997. In The Bright Side of Life (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, looking at the work of the Scottish Colourists. Two further programmes followed on European painters; Michael Palin and the Ladies Who Loved Matisse (2004) and Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi (2005), about the French artist Henri Matisse and Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershøi respectively. The DVD Michael Palin on Art contains all these documentaries except for the Matisse programme.\n\nIn November 2008, Palin presented a First World War documentary about Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when thousands of soldiers lost their lives in battle after the war had officially ended. Palin filmed on the battlefields of Northern France and Belgium for the programme, called the Last Day of World War One, produced for the BBC's Timewatch series.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nPalin was instrumental in setting up the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children in 1993. Also in 1993, each member of Monty Python had an asteroid named after him. Palin's is Asteroid 9621 Michaelpalin. In 2003, inside the Globe a commemorative stone was placed - Palin has his own stone, to mark donors to the theatre, but it is misspelt as \"Michael Pallin\". The story goes that John Cleese paid for the stone, and mischievously insisted on misspelling his name. \n\nIn honour of his achievements as a traveller, especially rail travel, Palin has two British trains named after him. In 2002, Virgin Trains' new £5 million high speed Super Voyager train number 221130 was named \"Michael Palin\" – it carries his name externally and a plaque is located adjacent to the onboard shop with information on Palin and his many journeys. Also, National Express East Anglia named a British Rail Class 153 (unit number 153335) after him. (He is also a model railway enthusiast.[http://www.009.cd2.com/young.htm 009.cd2.com])\n\nIn 2008, he received the James Joyce Award of the Literary and Historical Society in Dublin. In recognition of his services to the promotion of geography, Palin was awarded the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in March 2009, along with a Fellowship to the Society. In June 2013, he was similarly honoured in Canada with a gold medal for achievements in geography by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. In June 2009, Palin was elected for a three-year term as President of the Royal Geographical Society. Because of his self-described \"amenable, conciliatory character\" Michael Palin has been referred to as unofficially \"Britain's Nicest Man.\"\n\nIn September 2013, Moorlands School, Leeds named one of their school houses \"Palin\" after him. The University of St Andrews awarded Palin an honorary Doctor of Science degree during their June 2017 graduation ceremonies, with the degree recognising his contribution to the public's understanding of contemporary geography. He joins his fellow Pythons John Cleese and Terry Jones in receiving an honorary degree from the Fife institution.\n\nBibliography\n\nTravel books\n\n* Around the World in 80 Days (1989) \n* Pole to Pole (1992) \n* Full Circle (1997) \n* Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure (1999) \n* Sahara (2002) \n* Himalaya (2004) \n* New Europe (2007) \n* Brazil (2012) \n\nAll his travel books can also be read at no charge, complete and unabridged, on his website.\n\nAutobiography (contributor)\n\n* The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons (2003) \n\nDiaries\n\n* Diaries 1969–1979: The Python Years. 2006. \n* Diaries 1980–1988: Halfway to Hollywood – The Film Years.

Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various BBC programmes, such as The Ken Dodd Show, The Billy Cotton Bandshow, and The Illustrated Weekly Hudd. They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of writers working for The Frost Report, whose other members included Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Monty Python members Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, The Frost Report was the first time all the British members of Monty Python (its sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was at that time an American citizen) worked together. During the run of The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring John Bird: The Late Show and A series of Bird's. For A series of Bird's the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.\n\nFollowing The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team worked both as actors and writers on the show Twice a Fortnight with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, and the successful children's comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set with Idle and David Jason. The show also featured musical numbers by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, including future Monty Python musical collaborator Neil Innes. The animations for Do Not Adjust Your Set were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with PalinRoss, 91 sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in How to Irritate People together with Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for The Complete and Utter History of Britain.\n\nMonty Python\n\nOn the strength of their work on The Frost Report and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, among them Chapman's reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become Monty Python's Flying Circus. At the same time the success of Do Not Adjust Your Set had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, John Chapman, David Sherlock, Bob McCabe; Thomas Dunne Books; 2003\n\nIn Monty Python, Palin played various roles, which ranged from manic enthusiasm (such as the lumberjack of the Lumberjack Song, or Herbert Anchovy, host of the game show \"Blackmail\") to unflappable calmness (such as the Dead parrot vendor, Cheese Shop proprietor, or Postal Clerk). As a straight man he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits quietly as a marriage counsellor (Eric Idle) makes love to his wife (Carol Cleveland), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who wants to become a lion tamer. He also appeared as the \"It's\" man at the beginning of most episodes.\n\nPalin frequently co-wrote sketches with Terry Jones and also initiated the \"Spanish Inquisition sketch\", which included the catchphrase \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!\"\nHe also composed songs with Jones including \"The Lumberjack Song\", \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" and \"Spam\". His solo musical compositions included \"Decomposing Composers\" and \"Finland\".[http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82483 Monty Python Sings – Monty Python: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards: AllMusic]\n\nOther work\n\nAfter the Monty Python television series ended in 1974, the Palin/Jones team worked on Ripping Yarns, an intermittent television comedy series broadcast over three years from 1976. They had earlier collaborated on the play Secrets from the BBC series Black and Blue in 1973. He starred as Dennis the Peasant in Terry Gilliam's 1977 film Jabberwocky. Palin also appeared in All You Need Is Cash (1978) as Eric Manchester (based on Derek Taylor), the press agent for the Rutles. In 1980, Palin co-wrote Time Bandits with Terry Gilliam. He also acted in the film.\n\nIn 1982, Palin wrote and starred in The Missionary, co-starring Maggie Smith. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortescue, who is recalled from Africa to aid prostitutes. He co-starred with Maggie Smith again in the 1984 comedy film A Private Function. In 1984, he reunited with Terry Gilliam to appear in Brazil. He appeared in the comedy film A Fish Called Wanda, for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make Fierce Creatures. After filming for Fierce Creatures finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of Fierce Creatures had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot.\n\nUntil \"The Death of Stalin\" in 2017, and with the exception of several made-for-TV films and voice work for animations, Palin's last film role was a small part in The Wind in the Willows, a film directed by and starring Terry Jones. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, The Human Face. Palin was in the cast of You've Got Mail, the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy as a subplot novelist, but his role was eventually cut entirely. He also assisted Campaign for Better Transport and others with campaigns on sustainable transport, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has been president of the campaign since 1986.[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin Campaign for Better Transport website] \n\nPalin has also appeared in serious drama. In 1991 Palin worked as producer and actor in the film American Friends based upon a real event in the life of his great grandfather, a fellow at St John's College, Oxford. In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's Channel 4 drama series GBH.\n\nPalin also had a small cameo role in Australian soap opera Home and Away. He played an English surfer with a fear of sharks, who interrupts a conversation between two main characters to ask whether there were any sharks in the sea. This was filmed while he was in Australia for the Full Circle series, with a segment about the filming of the role featuring in the series. In November 2005, he appeared in the John Peel's Record Box documentary.[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 \"John Peel's Record Box\"], 2005\n\nIn 2013 Michael Palin appeared in a First World War drama titled The Wipers Times written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was announced that Palin was set to star alongside Adam Driver in Terry Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.Skinner, Craig (2016). [http://www.flickreel.com/terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-to-star-adam-driver-and-michael-palin-new-concept-art-uncovered/ EXCLUSIVE: TERRY GILLIAM’S THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE TO STAR ADAM DRIVER AND MICHAEL PALIN; NEW CONCEPT ART UNCOVERED], Flickreel.com, 11 May 2016 Palin, however, dropped out of the film after it ran into a financial problem.\n\nActivism\n\nIn July 2010, Palin sent a message of support for the Dongria Kondh tribe of India, who are resisting mining on their land by the company Vedanta Resources. Palin said, \"I've been to the Nyamgiri Hills in Orissa and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government. The tribe I visited simply want to carry on living in the villages that they and their ancestors have always lived in\".[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6269 Michael Palin sends message to support Dongria Kondh], Survival International\n\nOn 2 January 2011, Palin became the first person to sign the UK-based Campaign for Better Transport's Fair Fares Now campaign. In July 2015, Palin signed an open letter and gave an interview to support \"a strong BBC at the centre of British life\" at a time the government was reviewing the corporation's size and activities.\n\nTelevision documentaries\n\nTravel\n\nPalin's first travel documentary was segment 4 of the 1980 BBC Television series Great Railway Journeys of the World, entitled Confessions of a Trainspotter.  Throughout the hour long show, Palin humorously reminisces about his childhood hobby of train spotting, while he travels throughout the UK by train, from London to the Kyle of Lochalsh, via Manchester, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Inverness. He rides vintage train lines and trains including Flying Scotsman.  At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the station's long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.\n\nIn 1994, Palin travelled through Ireland for the same series, entitled \"Derry to Kerry\". In a quest for family roots, he attempted to trace his great grandmother – Brita Gallagher – who set sail from Ireland  years ago during the Great Famine (1845–1849), bound for a new life in Burlington, New Jersey. The series is a trip along the Palin family line.\n\nStarting in 1989, Palin appeared as presenter in a series of travel programmes made for the BBC. It was after the veteran TV globetrotter Alan Whicker and journalist Miles Kington turned down presenting the first of these, Around the World in 80 Days, that gave Palin the opportunity to present his first and subsequent travel shows. These programmes have been broadcast around the world in syndication, and were also sold on VHS tape and later on DVD:\n\n* Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days (Travel 1988; Programme release 1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous Jules Verne story without using aircraft.\n* Pole to Pole (Travel 1991; Programme release 1992): travelling from the North Pole to the South Pole, following as closely as possible the 30-degree line of longitude, over as much land as possible, i.e., through Europe and Africa.\n* Full Circle with Michael Palin (Travel 1995/96; Programme release 1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the Pacific Ocean anti-clockwise; a journey of almost 50000 mi starting on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait and taking him through Asia, Oceania and the Americas.\n* Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure (1999): retracing the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway through the United States, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.\n* Sahara with Michael Palin (Travel 2001/02; Programme release 2002): in which he trekked around and through the world's largest desert.\n* Himalaya with Michael Palin (Travel 2003/04; Programme release 2004): in which he travels through the Himalaya region.\n* Michael Palin's New Europe (Travel 2006/07; Programme release 2007): in which he travels through Central and Eastern Europe.\n* Brazil with Michael Palin (2012) in which he travels through Brazil.\n\nFollowing each trip, Palin wrote a book about his travels, providing information and insights not included in the TV programme. Each book is illustrated with photographs by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was on the team. (Exception: the first book, Around the World in 80 Days, contains some pictures by Pao but most are by other photographers.)\n\nAll seven of these books were also made available as audio books, and all of them are read by Palin himself. Around the World in 80 Days and Hemingway Adventure are unabridged, while the other four books were made in both abridged and unabridged versions, although the unabridged versions can be very difficult to find.\n\nFor four of the trips a photography book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.\n\nPalin's travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the \"Palin effect\": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions – for example, the significant increase in the number of tourists interested in Peru after Palin visited Machu Picchu. In a 2006 survey of \"15 of the world's top travel writers\" by The Observer, Palin named Peru's Pongo de Mainique (canyon below the Machu Picchu) his \"favourite place in the world\".\n\nPalin notes in his book of Around the World in 80 Days that the final leg of his journey could originally have taken him and his crew on one of the trains involved in the Clapham Junction rail crash, but they arrived ahead of schedule and caught an earlier train.\n\nArt and history\n\nIn recent years, Palin has written and presented occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on Scottish painter Anne Redpath, was Palin on Redpath in 1997. In The Bright Side of Life (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, looking at the work of the Scottish Colourists. Two further programmes followed on European painters; Michael Palin and the Ladies Who Loved Matisse (2004) and Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi (2005), about the French artist Henri Matisse and Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershøi respectively. The DVD Michael Palin on Art contains all these documentaries except for the Matisse programme.\n\nIn November 2008, Palin presented a First World War documentary about Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when thousands of soldiers lost their lives in battle after the war had officially ended. Palin filmed on the battlefields of Northern France and Belgium for the programme, called the Last Day of World War One, produced for the BBC's Timewatch series.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nPalin was instrumental in setting up the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children in 1993. Also in 1993, each member of Monty Python had an asteroid named after him. Palin's is Asteroid 9621 Michaelpalin. In 2003, inside the Globe a commemorative stone was placed - Palin has his own stone, to mark donors to the theatre, but it is misspelt as \"Michael Pallin\". The story goes that John Cleese paid for the stone, and mischievously insisted on misspelling his name. \n\nIn honour of his achievements as a traveller, especially rail travel, Palin has two British trains named after him. In 2002, Virgin Trains' new £5 million high speed Super Voyager train number 221130 was named \"Michael Palin\" – it carries his name externally and a plaque is located adjacent to the onboard shop with information on Palin and his many journeys. Also, National Express East Anglia named a British Rail Class 153 (unit number 153335) after him. (He is also a model railway enthusiast.[http://www.009.cd2.com/young.htm 009.cd2.com])\n\nIn 2008, he received the James Joyce Award of the Literary and Historical Society in Dublin. In recognition of his services to the promotion of geography, Palin was awarded the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in March 2009, along with a Fellowship to the Society. In June 2013, he was similarly honoured in Canada with a gold medal for achievements in geography by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. In June 2009, Palin was elected for a three-year term as President of the Royal Geographical Society. Because of his self-described \"amenable, conciliatory character\" Michael Palin has been referred to as unofficially \"Britain's Nicest Man.\"\n\nIn September 2013, Moorlands School, Leeds named one of their school houses \"Palin\" after him. The University of St Andrews awarded Palin an honorary Doctor of Science degree during their June 2017 graduation ceremonies, with the degree recognising his contribution to the public's understanding of contemporary geography. He joins his fellow Pythons John Cleese and Terry Jones in receiving an honorary degree from the Fife institution.\n\nBibliography\n\nTravel books\n\n* Around the World in 80 Days (1989) \n* Pole to Pole (1992) \n* Full Circle (1997) \n* Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure (1999) \n* Sahara (2002) \n* Himalaya (2004) \n* New Europe (2007) \n* Brazil (2012) \n\nAll his travel books can also be read at no charge, complete and unabridged, on his website.\n\nAutobiography (contributor)\n\n* The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons (2003) \n\nDiaries\n\n* Diaries 1969–1979: The Python Years. 2006. \n* Diaries 1980–1988: Halfway to Hollywood – The Film Years.
