  "textBody" : "S&M (an abbreviation of Symphony and Metallica) is a live album by American heavy metal band Metallica, with The San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen. It was recorded on April 21–22, 1999 at The Berkeley Community Theatre. This is the final Metallica album to feature Jason Newsted as Metallica's bassist.\n\nAlbum information\n\nS&M contains performances of Metallica songs with additional symphonic accompaniment, which was composed by Michael Kamen, who also conducted the orchestra during the concert. The idea to combine heavy metal with an epic classical approach, as James Hetfield has stated repeatedly,[http://www.allmetallica.com/info/interviews/destruction.php All Metallica - Symphony of Destruction - James Hetfield: 1999] was an idea of Cliff Burton. Burton’s love of classical music, especially of Johann Sebastian Bach, can be traced back to many instrumental parts and melodic characteristics in Metallica’s songwriting including songs from Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets.Michael Custodis, chapter Film Music in Concert: Metallica mit Michael Kamen, in: Klassische Musik heute. Eine Spurensuche in der Rockmusik, Bielefeld transcript-Verlag 2009  The other inspiration was Deep Purple's 1969 Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Purple revived their hybrid musical performance in 1999's In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra after being notified that Metallica were doing theirs earlier that year.\n\nIn addition to songs from previous albums spanning Ride the Lightning through ReLoad, there are two new compositions: \"No Leaf Clover\" and \"−Human\". \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" by Ennio Morricone, Metallica's entrance music, was played live by the orchestra. \"No Leaf Clover\" has since been performed by Metallica in concert, using a recording of the orchestral prelude.\n\nSeveral other songs, including \"Wasting My Hate\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Low Man's Lyric\", \"Fade to Black\", The Unforgiven II, \"Through the Never\", \"Harvester of Sorrow\", and even more obscure and lesser-played tracks such as \"Ronnie\" and \"Mama Said\" were considered for selection, but were eventually dropped as it was decided by both Metallica and Kamen that they were not well-suited for symphonic accompaniment. Unexpectedly, the nearly ten-minute  \"...And Justice For All\" was also considered for the setlist but, due to the gap in time since the band last played it and with little time to prepare, the idea was abandoned.  On the S&M DVD documentary, Metallica and Kamen can be seen and heard discussing the orchestration for \"So What?\", though it's obvious both parties were enjoying a good joke and had no intentions of performing the song.\n\nChanges were made to the lyrics of some songs, most notably the removal of the second verse and chorus of \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" and playing the third verse in its place.\n\nThe \"S\" in the stylized \"S&M\" on the album cover is a backwards treble clef, while the \"M\" is taken from Metallica's logo.\n\nThe drum kit Ulrich used on the album currently resides in a Guitar Center in San Francisco.\n\nCritical reception\n\n*Rolling Stone (January 20, 2000, pp. 57–59) - 3 stars out of 5 - \"...create the most crowded, ceiling-rattling basement rec room in rock....[in its] sheer awesomeness...the live performance succeeded....the monster numbers benefit from supersizing.

As of 2003, the album had been certified 5× platinum. As of August 2013 the album had sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nThis album was also ranked 48th on NME's list of 50 Greatest Live Albums.\n\nWith Kamen's death in 2003, Metallica has not revisited the S&M concept in any further performances or recording work.\n\nTrack listing\n\nVideo release\n\nMetallica also filmed and released the concert in DVD and VHS with direction by Wayne Isham. The VHS set has only the concert video, while the double DVD set has 5.1 sound (also: 2.0 band+orchestra, 2.0 band-only and 2.0 orchestra-only), 41 minute documentary about the concert, and two \"No Leaf Clover\" music videos: \"Slice & Dice\" version and the \"Maestro Edit\". The DVD also contains four songs with multi-angles where each band member can be viewed individually: \"Of Wolf and Man\", \"Fuel\", \"Sad But True\", and \"Enter Sandman\".\n\nPersonnel\n\nMetallica\n\n* James Hetfield – lead vocals, rhythm guitar \n* Kirk Hammett – lead guitar\n* Jason Newsted – bass, backing vocals\n* Lars Ulrich – drums\n\nVideo production\n\n* Wayne Isham – video director\n* Bart Lipton – video producer\n* Dana Marshall – video producer\n\nSan Francisco Symphony\n\n* Michael Kamen – conductor\n* John Kieser – general manager\n* Eric Achen, Joshua Garrett, Douglas Hull, Jonathan Ring, Bruce Roberts, Robert Ward, James Smelser – French horns\n* David Teie principal, Richard Andaya, Barara Bogatin, Jill Rachuy Brindel, David Goldblatt – cello\n* Jeremy Constant concertmaster, Daniel Banner, Enrique Bocedi, Paul Brancato, Catherine Down, Bruce Freifeld, Connie Gantsweg, Michael Gerling, Frances Jeffrey, Robert Zelnick, Yukiko Kamei, Naomi Kazama, Kum Mo Kim, Yasuko Hattori, Melissa Kleinbart, Mo Kobialka, Daniel Kobialka, Rudolph Kremer, Kelly Leon-Pearce, Diane Nicholeris, Florin Parvulescu, Anne Pinsker, Victor Romasevich, Philip Santos, Peter Shelton – violins\n* Chris Bogios, Glenn Fischthal, Andrew McCandless, Craig Morris – trumpets\n* Stephen Paulson, Steven Dibner, Rob Weir – bassoons\n* Steven Braunstein – contrabassoon\n* Charles Chandler, Laurence Epstein, Chris Gilbert, William Ritchen, Stephen Tramontozzi, S.
