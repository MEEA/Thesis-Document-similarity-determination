  "textBody" : "Lucifer ( ) is a name that, according to dictionaries of the English language, refers to the Devil or to the planet Venus when appearing as the morning star.\n\nAs a name for the Devil, the more common meaning in English, \"Lucifer\" is the rendering of the Hebrew word  in Isaiah () given in the King James Version. This Bible version took the word from the Latin Vulgate, which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized), meaning \"the morning star, the planet Venus\", or, as an adjective, \"light-bringing\".\n\nAs a name for the morning star, \"Lucifer\" is a proper name and is capitalized in English. In the Greco-Roman civilization the morning star was also personified and considered a pagan god.[https://books.google.com/books?id2U7okUE3PIcC&pg\nPA193&dqdixon-kennedy+lucifer&hl\nen&saX&redir_esc\ny#vonepage&q\ndixon-kennedy%20lucifer&f=false Mike Dixon-Kennedy, Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology (ABC-CLIO 1998), p. 193]  At that time the distinction between capitalized and lower-case letters had not yet been invented.[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150902-the-mysterious-origins-of-punctuation Keith Houston, \"The mysterious origins of punctuation\"]\n\nIn Isaiah 14:12 \n\nThe Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale),[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?StrongsH1966&t\nKJV Strong's Concordance, H1966]: \"shining one, morning star, Lucifer; of the king of Babylon and Satan (fig.)\" occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means \"shining one, light-bearer\". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος (heōsphoros), a name, literally \"bringer of dawn\", for the morning star.\n\nAccording to both Christian[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/14-12.htm Examples of Christian literal exegesis of Isaiah 14:12] and Jewish exegesis, in the Book of Isaiah, chapter 14, the King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar II, conqueror of Jerusalem, is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called the \"Morning Star\" (planet Venus).Helel ben Shaḥar \"day-star, son of the dawn\"; planet Venus is one of the brightest celestial bodies at night, which can be seen in the early morning when no other star can be seen any more, but vanishes when the sun, the real light, rises. In this chapter the Hebrew text says . \"Helel ben Shahar\" may refer to the Morning Star, but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet.Gunkel, \"Schöpfung und Chaos,\" pp. 132 et seq.\n\nLater Christian tradition came to use the Latin word for \"morning star\", lucifer, as the proper name (\"Lucifer\") of the Devil as he was before his fall. As a result, \"Lucifer has become a byword for Satan / the Devil in the church and in popular literature\", as in Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Joost van den Vondel's Lucifer, and John Milton's Paradise Lost. However, unlike the English word, the Latin word was not used exclusively in this way and was applied to others also, including Jesus.See Latin word lucifer below. The image of a morning star fallen from the sky is generally believed among scholars to have a parallel in Canaanite mythology.See #Mythology\n\nLiteral meaning \n\nThe translation of הֵילֵל as \"Lucifer\", as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render הֵילֵל as \"morning star\" (New International Version, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, Good News Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible), \"daystar\" (New Jerusalem Bible, The Message), \"Day Star\" (New Revised Standard Version, English Standard Version), \"shining one\" (New Life Version, New World Translation, JPS Tanakh), or \"shining star\" (New Living Translation).\n\nThe term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon, who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (Hêlêl ben Šāḥar), rendered in the King James Version as \"O Lucifer, son of the morning!\" and in others as \"morning star, son of the dawn\".\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\" After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n:\"How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'\"\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man; and that man may have been not Nebuchadnezzar II, but rather his son, Belshazzar. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god Sin (possibly analogous with Hubal, the primary god of pre-Islamic Mecca), and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.\n\nFor the unnamed \"king of Babylon\" a wide range of identifications have been proposed. They include a Babylonian ruler of the prophet Isaiah's own time the later Nebuchadnezzar II, under whom the Babylonian captivity of the Jews began, or Nabonidus, and the Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon II and Sennacherib. Herbert Wolf held that the \"king of Babylon\" was not a specific ruler but a generic representation of the whole line of rulers.\n\nMythology\n\nCanaanite mythology \n\nIn ancient Canaanite mythology, the morning star is pictured as a god, Attar, who attempted to occupy the throne of Ba'al and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the underworld.[https://books.google.com/books?idy-gfwlltlRwC John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. . ), pp. 172–173[https://books.google.com/books?id\nHj791_BeAF0C Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict] (InterVarsity Press, 1997 . ), pp. 159–160 The original myth may have been about a lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El who lived on a mountain to the north. Hermann Gunkel's reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called Hêlal, whose ambition was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities, but who had to descend to the depths; it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun.\n\nSimilarities have been noted with the East Semitic story of Ishtar's or Inanna's descent into the underworld, Ishtar and Inanna being associated with the planet Venus. A connection has been seen also with the Babylonian myth of Etana. The Jewish Encyclopedia comments:\n\n:\"The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and Zu: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods ... but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus.\"\n\nThe Greek myth of Phaethon, whose name, like that of הֵילֵל, means \"Shining One\", has also been seen as similar. [https://books.google.com/books?id\npNstLQ8i3nsC&pgPA90&dq\n%22it+is+even+more+definitely+certain+that+we+are+dealing+with+a+native+myth!%22 page 90: \"it is even more definitely certain that we are dealing with a native myth!\"]\n\nThe Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible points out that no evidence has been found of any Canaanite myth of a god being thrown from heaven, as in Isaiah 14:12. It concludes that the closest parallels with Isaiah's description of the king of Babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in any lost Canaanite and other myths but in traditional ideas of the Jewish people themselves, echoed in the Biblical account of the fall of Adam and Eve, cast out of God's presence for wishing to be as God, and the picture in  of the \"gods\" and \"sons of the Most High\" destined to die and fall. This Jewish tradition has echoes also in Jewish pseudepigrapha such as 2 Enoch and the Life of Adam and Eve.\n\nClassical mythology \n\nIn classical mythology, Lucifer (\"light-bringer\" in Latin), Phosphorus (same meaning in Greek), Eosphoros (\"dawn-bringer\" in Greek) was a  personification of the morning star as a male figure bearing a torch,[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lucifer-classical-mythology \"Lucifer]\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica] \"the fabled son of Aurora and Cephalus, and father of Ceyx\". There is almost no legend about the Lucifer of classical mythology, but he was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.\n\nLatin\n\nAs an adjective, the Latin word lucifer meant \"light-bringing\" and was applied to the moon. As a noun, it meant \"morning star\", or, in Roman mythology, its divine personification, as indicated above under Classical mythology, or. in poetry, one day in a succession of days.\n\n is not the only place where the Vulgate uses the word lucifer. It uses the same word four more times, in contexts where it clearly has no reference to a fallen angel:  (meaning \"morning star\"),  (\"the light of the morning\"),  (\"the signs of the zodiac\") and  (\"the dawn\").[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09410a.htm Anthony Maas, \"Lucifer\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910)] Lucifer is not the only expression that the Vulgate uses to speak of the morning star: three times it uses stella matutina:  (referring to the actual morning star), and  (of uncertain reference) and  (referring to Jesus).\n\nIndications that in Christian tradition the Latin word lucifer, unlike the English word, did not necessarily call a fallen angel to mind exist also outside the text of the Vulgate. Two bishops bore that name: Saint Lucifer of Cagliari, and Lucifer of Siena.\n\nIn Latin, the word is applied to John the Baptist and is used as a title of Jesus himself in several early Christian hymns. The morning hymn Lucis largitor splendide of Hilary contains the line: \"Tu verus mundi lucifer\" (you are the true light bringer of the world).March, Francis Andrew Latin Hymns with English Notes, Douglass Series of Christian Greek and Latin Writers. Vol.1 Latin Hymns. Notes p218 \"Lucifer: God - Christ is here addressed as the true light bringer, in distinction from the planet Venus. Such etymological turns are common in the hymns. Lucifer is a familiar epithet of John the Baptist in the early church, as well as of the \"Son of the morning,\" mentioned in Isaiah xiv., ... This description of the King of Babylon was applied by Tertullian and others to Satan, and the mistake has led to the present meanings of Lucifer. See Webster's Dictionary.\" Some interpreted the mention of the morning star (lucifer) in Ambrose's hymn Aeterne rerum conditor as referring allegorically to Jesus and the mention of the cock, the herald of the day (praeco) in the same hymn as referring to John the Baptist.March Notes p224 \"Lucifer: this the lovers of allegory interpreted of Christ, making John the Baptist the praeco.\" Likewise, in the medieval hymn Christe qui lux es et dies, some manuscripts have the line \"Lucifer lucem proferens\".March Notes p235 \"For the use of Lucifer for Christ, see Hilary's hymn as above\".\n\nThe Latin word lucifer is also used of Jesus in the Easter Proclamation prayer to God regarding the paschal candle: Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum (\"May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever\"). In the works of Latin grammarians, Lucifer, like Daniel, was discussed as an example of a personal name.[https://books.google.com/books?idkDi9rHgh8lYC&pg\nPA66&dqAmsler+Lucifer+%22proper+name%22&hl\nen&saX&ei\nfjFUUp-JGdKGhQfD6YHwBA&redir_escy#v\nonepage&qAmsler%20Lucifer%20%22proper%20name%22&f\nfalse Mark Amsler, Etymology and Grammatical Discourse in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (John Benjamins 1989)] , p. 66\n\nJewish exegesis \n\nThe Hebrew words  in Isaiah 14:12 are part of a prophetic vision against an oppressive king of Babylon. Jewish exegesis of Isaiah 14:12–15 identified the king of Babylon as Nebuchadnezzar II. Verse 20 says that this king of Babylon will not be \"joined with them [all the kings of the nations] in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever\", but rather be cast out of the grave, while \"All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house\".Isaiah 14:18\n\nApocrypha and pseudepigrapha\n\nIn the Second Temple period literature the main possible reference is found in 2 Enoch, also known as Slavonic Enoch:\n\nHowever the editor of the standard modern edition (Charlesworth, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.1) pipelines the verse as a probable later Christian interpolation on the grounds that \"Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10:18 with Isa 14 and eventually Gen. 3 so vs 4 could be a Christian interpolation... Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6., and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses.\" Furthermore, the name used in 2 Enoch, Satanail, is not directly related to the Isaiah 14 text, and the surrounding imagery of fire suggests .Charlesworth Old Testament Pseudepigrapha vol.1 p. 139 \"Origen falls back on the Bible when he expands the fall of Lucifer\" p. 148 2 Enoch 29:3 Here Satanail was hurled from the height together with his angels \"form of the Lucifer myth found here in 2En\" p. 149 2 Enoch footnote Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10:18 with Isa 14 and eventually Gen. 3 so vs 4 could be a Christian interpolation. In the Byzantine tradition Satan's revolt took place on the fourth day, not the second as here. Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6., and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses.\n\nOther instances of lucifer in the Old Testament pseudepigrapha are related to the \"star\" Venus, in the Sibylline Oracles battle of the constellations (line 517) \"Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo\",Charlesworth Vol.1 p. 405 Sibylline Oracles line 517 \"Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo\" or the entirely rewritten Christian version of the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra 4:32 which has a reference to Lucifer as Antichrist.p. 567 Greek Apocalypse of Ezra Antichrist \"the 'Lucifer' theme (4:32)\n\nAn association of Isaiah 14:12–18 with a personification of evil, called the devil developed outside of mainstream Rabbinic Judaism in pseudepigrapha and Christian writings, particularly with the apocalypses.\n\nEspecially Isaiah 14:12, became a dominant conception of a fallen angel motif in 1 Enoch 86-90 and 2 Enoch 29:3–4. Rabbinical Judaism rejected any belief in rebel or fallen angels. In the 11th century, the Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer illustrates the origin of the \"fallen angel myth\" by giving two accounts, one relates to the angel in the Garden of Eden who seduces Eve, and the other relates to the angels, the benei elohim who cohabit with the daughters of man (Genesis 6:1–4).Adelman, Rachel (2009). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?idZ7Ue5kAkw20C&pg\nPA62&dq=%22+Book+of+Enoch%22 61–62].\n\nChristianity\n\nChristian writers applied the words of Isaiah 14:12 to Satan. Sigve K Tonstad argues that the New Testament War in Heaven theme of , in which the dragon \"who is called the devil and Satan … was thrown down to the earth\", derives from the passage in Isaiah 14. Origen (184/185 – 253/254) interpreted such Old Testament passages as being about manifestations of the Devil; but writing in Greek, not Latin, he did not identify the devil with the name \"Lucifer\".Auffarth, Christoph; Stuckenbruck, Loren T., eds. (2004). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id\nlhNyGFkT3QYC&pgPA62&dq\nOrigen+Lucifer 62]. Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 225), who wrote in Latin, also understood  (\"I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High\") as spoken by the Devil, but \"Lucifer\" is not among the numerous names and phrases he used to describe the devil. Even at the time of the Latin writer Augustine of Hippo (354–430), \"Lucifer\" had not yet become a common name for the Devil.\n\nSome time later, the metaphor of the morning star that Isaiah 14:12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for \"morning star\", capitalized, as the original name of the devil before his fall from grace, linking Isaiah 14:12 with  (\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven\") and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan's fall from heaven.\n\nHowever, the understanding of the morning star in Isaiah 14:12 as a metaphor referring to a king of Babylon continued also to exist among Christians. Theodoret of Cyrus (c. 393 – c. 457) wrote that Isaiah calls the king \"morning star\", not as being the star, but as having had the illusion of being it. The same understanding is shown in Christian translations of the passage, which in English generally use \"morning star\" rather than treating the word as a proper name, \"Lucifer\". So too in other languages, such as French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Even the Vulgate text in Latin is printed with lower-case lucifer (morning star), not upper-case Lucifer (proper name).\n\nCalvin said: \"The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance: for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians.\" Luther also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil.\n\nLucifer as Satan or the devil \n\nAdherents of the King James Only movement and others who hold that Isaiah 14:12 does indeed refer to the devil have decried the modern translations.\n\nThose treating \"Lucifer\" as a name for Satan may use that name when speaking of such accounts of the devil or Satan as the following:\n* Satan inciting David to number Israel (1 Chronicles ), though in 2 Samuel  it is stated that God caused David to take census of Israel\n* Job tested by Satan (Book of Job)\n* Satan ready to accuse the high priest Joshua (Zechariah )\n* Sin brought into the world through the devil's envy (Wisdom )\n* \"The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience\" (Ephesians )\n* \"The god of this world\" (2 Corinthians ).\n* The devil disputing with Michael about the body of Moses (Jude )\n* The dragon of the Book of Revelation \"who is called the devil and Satan\" ()\n\nThey may also use the name \"Lucifer\" when speaking of Satan's motive for rebelling and of the nature of his sin, which, without using the name \"Lucifer\", Origen, Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine attributed to the devil's pride, and Irenaeus, Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Cyprian, and again Augustine attributed to the devil's envy of humanity created in the image of God. Jealousy of humans, created in the divine image and given authority over the world is the motive that a modern writer, who denies that there is any such person as Lucifer, says that Tertullian attributed to the devil, and, while he cited Tertullian and Augustine as giving envy as the motive for the fall, an 18th-century French Capuchin preacher himself described the rebel angel as jealous of Adam's exaltation, which he saw as a diminution of his own status.\n\nLatter-day Saints \n\nLucifer is regarded within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the pre-mortal name of the devil. Mormon theology teaches that in a heavenly council, Lucifer rebelled against the plan of God the Father and was subsequently cast out. Mormon scripture reads:\"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.\"After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer \"goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men\". Mormons consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.\n\nIslam\n\nMorning Star in Islamic legend\n\nIn Islamic and Persian teachings the Morning Star or Ishtar is called Zohra or Zohrah and were once a beautiful woman called.Muhammad Asad The Road To Mecca The Book Foundation 1954  Two fallen angels named Harut and Marut, were seduced by her beauty to commit shirk, murder, adultery and drinking wine. In their drunken state, Zohra elicited from these angels the secret words to ascend to heaven. Then she uttered the secret words, she elevated to the first heaven, but was imprisoned or transformed into Venus.William Percy William Percy's Mahomet and His Heaven: A Critical Edition Ashgate Publishing 2006  page 18\n\nIslamic account of the Devil\n\nIn Islam the Devil is known as  (, plural:  ') or  (, plural:  '). Iblis is banished from heaven for refusing to prostrate himself before Adam, which is similar to the earlier 3 Enoch, chapter 4, in which all of the angels prostrate themselves before Enoch, an early descendant of Adam. Thus, he sins after the creation of man. He asks God for seducing human to sin until judgment day as long God's curse rest on him.Mahmoud Ayoub The Qur'an and Its Interpreters , Volume 1 SUNY Press 1984  page 87 God grants this request, and Iblis then swears revenge by tempting human beings and turning them away from God. God tells him that any humans who follow him will join him in the fire of hell at judgment day, but that Iblis will have no power over all mankind except who wants to follow Iblis. QS (17:63–65) This story is cited multiple times in the Qur'an for different reasons.\n\nIslamic literature presents Iblis as God worshipping and very pious until he refused to prostrate to Adam due to his jealousy and pride.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nlNAWAgAAQBAJ&pgPA170&dq\nIslam+Iblis+jinn&hlen&sa\nX&eiSRYYVIC3F-iM7QbLkIGIDQ&ved\n0CE4Q6AEwBw#vonepage&q\nIslam%20Iblis%20jinn&ffalse Scott B.

Therefore he created the material world and trapped souls from heaven inside matter. Jesus descended to earth to free the captured souls.Michael C. Thomsett Heresy in the Roman Catholic Church: A History McFarland 2011  page 71Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition Shambhala Publications 2009  p. 745-755 and p. 831\n\nAnthroposophy\n\nRudolf Steiner's writings, which formed the basis for Anthroposophy, characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to Ahriman, with Christ between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious/philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nOccultism\n\nLuciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.\n\nIn Anton LaVey's The Satanic Bible, Lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell, particularly that of the East, the 'lord of the air', and is called the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment. The title 'lord of the air' is based upon Ephesians 2:2, which uses the phrase 'prince of the power of the air' to refer to the pagan god Zeus, but that phrase later became conflated with Satan.\n\nAuthor Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a \"mask\" of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.\n\nTaxil's hoax\n\nLéo Taxil (1854–1907) claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the Taxil hoax, he alleged that leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed \"The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world\" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the \"Luciferian path,\" or the \"energies of Lucifer,\" they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer,\"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 321).

    "aggregatedText" : "Lucifer ( ) is a name that, according to dictionaries of the English language, refers to the Devil or to the planet Venus when appearing as the morning star.\n\nAs a name for the Devil, the more common meaning in English, \"Lucifer\" is the rendering of the Hebrew word  in Isaiah () given in the King James Version. This Bible version took the word from the Latin Vulgate, which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized), meaning \"the morning star, the planet Venus\", or, as an adjective, \"light-bringing\".\n\nAs a name for the morning star, \"Lucifer\" is a proper name and is capitalized in English. In the Greco-Roman civilization the morning star was also personified and considered a pagan god.[https://books.google.com/books?id2U7okUE3PIcC&pg\nPA193&dqdixon-kennedy+lucifer&hl\nen&saX&redir_esc\ny#vonepage&q\ndixon-kennedy%20lucifer&f=false Mike Dixon-Kennedy, Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology (ABC-CLIO 1998), p. 193]  At that time the distinction between capitalized and lower-case letters had not yet been invented.[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150902-the-mysterious-origins-of-punctuation Keith Houston, \"The mysterious origins of punctuation\"]\n\nIn Isaiah 14:12 \n\nThe Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale),[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?StrongsH1966&t\nKJV Strong's Concordance, H1966]: \"shining one, morning star, Lucifer; of the king of Babylon and Satan (fig.)\" occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means \"shining one, light-bearer\". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος (heōsphoros), a name, literally \"bringer of dawn\", for the morning star.\n\nAccording to both Christian[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/14-12.htm Examples of Christian literal exegesis of Isaiah 14:12] and Jewish exegesis, in the Book of Isaiah, chapter 14, the King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar II, conqueror of Jerusalem, is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called the \"Morning Star\" (planet Venus).Helel ben Shaḥar \"day-star, son of the dawn\"; planet Venus is one of the brightest celestial bodies at night, which can be seen in the early morning when no other star can be seen any more, but vanishes when the sun, the real light, rises. In this chapter the Hebrew text says . \"Helel ben Shahar\" may refer to the Morning Star, but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet.Gunkel, \"Schöpfung und Chaos,\" pp. 132 et seq.\n\nLater Christian tradition came to use the Latin word for \"morning star\", lucifer, as the proper name (\"Lucifer\") of the Devil as he was before his fall. As a result, \"Lucifer has become a byword for Satan / the Devil in the church and in popular literature\", as in Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Joost van den Vondel's Lucifer, and John Milton's Paradise Lost. However, unlike the English word, the Latin word was not used exclusively in this way and was applied to others also, including Jesus.See Latin word lucifer below. The image of a morning star fallen from the sky is generally believed among scholars to have a parallel in Canaanite mythology.See #Mythology\n\nLiteral meaning \n\nThe translation of הֵילֵל as \"Lucifer\", as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render הֵילֵל as \"morning star\" (New International Version, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, Good News Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible), \"daystar\" (New Jerusalem Bible, The Message), \"Day Star\" (New Revised Standard Version, English Standard Version), \"shining one\" (New Life Version, New World Translation, JPS Tanakh), or \"shining star\" (New Living Translation).\n\nThe term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon, who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (Hêlêl ben Šāḥar), rendered in the King James Version as \"O Lucifer, son of the morning!\" and in others as \"morning star, son of the dawn\".\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\" After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n:\"How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'\"\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man; and that man may have been not Nebuchadnezzar II, but rather his son, Belshazzar. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god Sin (possibly analogous with Hubal, the primary god of pre-Islamic Mecca), and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.\n\nFor the unnamed \"king of Babylon\" a wide range of identifications have been proposed. They include a Babylonian ruler of the prophet Isaiah's own time the later Nebuchadnezzar II, under whom the Babylonian captivity of the Jews began, or Nabonidus, and the Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon II and Sennacherib. Herbert Wolf held that the \"king of Babylon\" was not a specific ruler but a generic representation of the whole line of rulers.\n\nMythology\n\nCanaanite mythology \n\nIn ancient Canaanite mythology, the morning star is pictured as a god, Attar, who attempted to occupy the throne of Ba'al and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the underworld.[https://books.google.com/books?idy-gfwlltlRwC John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. . ), pp. 172–173[https://books.google.com/books?id\nHj791_BeAF0C Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict] (InterVarsity Press, 1997 . ), pp. 159–160 The original myth may have been about a lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El who lived on a mountain to the north. Hermann Gunkel's reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called Hêlal, whose ambition was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities, but who had to descend to the depths; it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun.\n\nSimilarities have been noted with the East Semitic story of Ishtar's or Inanna's descent into the underworld, Ishtar and Inanna being associated with the planet Venus. A connection has been seen also with the Babylonian myth of Etana. The Jewish Encyclopedia comments:\n\n:\"The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and Zu: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods ... but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus.\"\n\nThe Greek myth of Phaethon, whose name, like that of הֵילֵל, means \"Shining One\", has also been seen as similar. [https://books.google.com/books?id\npNstLQ8i3nsC&pgPA90&dq\n%22it+is+even+more+definitely+certain+that+we+are+dealing+with+a+native+myth!%22 page 90: \"it is even more definitely certain that we are dealing with a native myth!\"]\n\nThe Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible points out that no evidence has been found of any Canaanite myth of a god being thrown from heaven, as in Isaiah 14:12. It concludes that the closest parallels with Isaiah's description of the king of Babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in any lost Canaanite and other myths but in traditional ideas of the Jewish people themselves, echoed in the Biblical account of the fall of Adam and Eve, cast out of God's presence for wishing to be as God, and the picture in  of the \"gods\" and \"sons of the Most High\" destined to die and fall. This Jewish tradition has echoes also in Jewish pseudepigrapha such as 2 Enoch and the Life of Adam and Eve.\n\nClassical mythology \n\nIn classical mythology, Lucifer (\"light-bringer\" in Latin), Phosphorus (same meaning in Greek), Eosphoros (\"dawn-bringer\" in Greek) was a  personification of the morning star as a male figure bearing a torch,[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lucifer-classical-mythology \"Lucifer]\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica] \"the fabled son of Aurora and Cephalus, and father of Ceyx\". There is almost no legend about the Lucifer of classical mythology, but he was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.\n\nLatin\n\nAs an adjective, the Latin word lucifer meant \"light-bringing\" and was applied to the moon. As a noun, it meant \"morning star\", or, in Roman mythology, its divine personification, as indicated above under Classical mythology, or. in poetry, one day in a succession of days.\n\n is not the only place where the Vulgate uses the word lucifer. It uses the same word four more times, in contexts where it clearly has no reference to a fallen angel:  (meaning \"morning star\"),  (\"the light of the morning\"),  (\"the signs of the zodiac\") and  (\"the dawn\").[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09410a.htm Anthony Maas, \"Lucifer\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910)] Lucifer is not the only expression that the Vulgate uses to speak of the morning star: three times it uses stella matutina:  (referring to the actual morning star), and  (of uncertain reference) and  (referring to Jesus).\n\nIndications that in Christian tradition the Latin word lucifer, unlike the English word, did not necessarily call a fallen angel to mind exist also outside the text of the Vulgate. Two bishops bore that name: Saint Lucifer of Cagliari, and Lucifer of Siena.\n\nIn Latin, the word is applied to John the Baptist and is used as a title of Jesus himself in several early Christian hymns. The morning hymn Lucis largitor splendide of Hilary contains the line: \"Tu verus mundi lucifer\" (you are the true light bringer of the world).March, Francis Andrew Latin Hymns with English Notes, Douglass Series of Christian Greek and Latin Writers. Vol.1 Latin Hymns. Notes p218 \"Lucifer: God - Christ is here addressed as the true light bringer, in distinction from the planet Venus. Such etymological turns are common in the hymns. Lucifer is a familiar epithet of John the Baptist in the early church, as well as of the \"Son of the morning,\" mentioned in Isaiah xiv., ... This description of the King of Babylon was applied by Tertullian and others to Satan, and the mistake has led to the present meanings of Lucifer. See Webster's Dictionary.\" Some interpreted the mention of the morning star (lucifer) in Ambrose's hymn Aeterne rerum conditor as referring allegorically to Jesus and the mention of the cock, the herald of the day (praeco) in the same hymn as referring to John the Baptist.March Notes p224 \"Lucifer: this the lovers of allegory interpreted of Christ, making John the Baptist the praeco.\" Likewise, in the medieval hymn Christe qui lux es et dies, some manuscripts have the line \"Lucifer lucem proferens\".March Notes p235 \"For the use of Lucifer for Christ, see Hilary's hymn as above\".\n\nThe Latin word lucifer is also used of Jesus in the Easter Proclamation prayer to God regarding the paschal candle: Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum (\"May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever\"). In the works of Latin grammarians, Lucifer, like Daniel, was discussed as an example of a personal name.[https://books.google.com/books?idkDi9rHgh8lYC&pg\nPA66&dqAmsler+Lucifer+%22proper+name%22&hl\nen&saX&ei\nfjFUUp-JGdKGhQfD6YHwBA&redir_escy#v\nonepage&qAmsler%20Lucifer%20%22proper%20name%22&f\nfalse Mark Amsler, Etymology and Grammatical Discourse in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (John Benjamins 1989)] , p. 66\n\nJewish exegesis \n\nThe Hebrew words  in Isaiah 14:12 are part of a prophetic vision against an oppressive king of Babylon. Jewish exegesis of Isaiah 14:12–15 identified the king of Babylon as Nebuchadnezzar II. Verse 20 says that this king of Babylon will not be \"joined with them [all the kings of the nations] in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever\", but rather be cast out of the grave, while \"All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house\".Isaiah 14:18\n\nApocrypha and pseudepigrapha\n\nIn the Second Temple period literature the main possible reference is found in 2 Enoch, also known as Slavonic Enoch:\n\nHowever the editor of the standard modern edition (Charlesworth, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.1) pipelines the verse as a probable later Christian interpolation on the grounds that \"Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10:18 with Isa 14 and eventually Gen. 3 so vs 4 could be a Christian interpolation... Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6., and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses.\" Furthermore, the name used in 2 Enoch, Satanail, is not directly related to the Isaiah 14 text, and the surrounding imagery of fire suggests .Charlesworth Old Testament Pseudepigrapha vol.1 p. 139 \"Origen falls back on the Bible when he expands the fall of Lucifer\" p. 148 2 Enoch 29:3 Here Satanail was hurled from the height together with his angels \"form of the Lucifer myth found here in 2En\" p. 149 2 Enoch footnote Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10:18 with Isa 14 and eventually Gen. 3 so vs 4 could be a Christian interpolation. In the Byzantine tradition Satan's revolt took place on the fourth day, not the second as here. Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6., and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses.\n\nOther instances of lucifer in the Old Testament pseudepigrapha are related to the \"star\" Venus, in the Sibylline Oracles battle of the constellations (line 517) \"Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo\",Charlesworth Vol.1 p. 405 Sibylline Oracles line 517 \"Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo\" or the entirely rewritten Christian version of the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra 4:32 which has a reference to Lucifer as Antichrist.p. 567 Greek Apocalypse of Ezra Antichrist \"the 'Lucifer' theme (4:32)\n\nAn association of Isaiah 14:12–18 with a personification of evil, called the devil developed outside of mainstream Rabbinic Judaism in pseudepigrapha and Christian writings, particularly with the apocalypses.\n\nEspecially Isaiah 14:12, became a dominant conception of a fallen angel motif in 1 Enoch 86-90 and 2 Enoch 29:3–4. Rabbinical Judaism rejected any belief in rebel or fallen angels. In the 11th century, the Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer illustrates the origin of the \"fallen angel myth\" by giving two accounts, one relates to the angel in the Garden of Eden who seduces Eve, and the other relates to the angels, the benei elohim who cohabit with the daughters of man (Genesis 6:1–4).Adelman, Rachel (2009). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?idZ7Ue5kAkw20C&pg\nPA62&dq=%22+Book+of+Enoch%22 61–62].\n\nChristianity\n\nChristian writers applied the words of Isaiah 14:12 to Satan. Sigve K Tonstad argues that the New Testament War in Heaven theme of , in which the dragon \"who is called the devil and Satan … was thrown down to the earth\", derives from the passage in Isaiah 14. Origen (184/185 – 253/254) interpreted such Old Testament passages as being about manifestations of the Devil; but writing in Greek, not Latin, he did not identify the devil with the name \"Lucifer\".Auffarth, Christoph; Stuckenbruck, Loren T., eds. (2004). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id\nlhNyGFkT3QYC&pgPA62&dq\nOrigen+Lucifer 62]. Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 225), who wrote in Latin, also understood  (\"I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High\") as spoken by the Devil, but \"Lucifer\" is not among the numerous names and phrases he used to describe the devil. Even at the time of the Latin writer Augustine of Hippo (354–430), \"Lucifer\" had not yet become a common name for the Devil.\n\nSome time later, the metaphor of the morning star that Isaiah 14:12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for \"morning star\", capitalized, as the original name of the devil before his fall from grace, linking Isaiah 14:12 with  (\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven\") and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan's fall from heaven.\n\nHowever, the understanding of the morning star in Isaiah 14:12 as a metaphor referring to a king of Babylon continued also to exist among Christians. Theodoret of Cyrus (c. 393 – c. 457) wrote that Isaiah calls the king \"morning star\", not as being the star, but as having had the illusion of being it. The same understanding is shown in Christian translations of the passage, which in English generally use \"morning star\" rather than treating the word as a proper name, \"Lucifer\". So too in other languages, such as French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Even the Vulgate text in Latin is printed with lower-case lucifer (morning star), not upper-case Lucifer (proper name).\n\nCalvin said: \"The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance: for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians.\" Luther also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil.\n\nLucifer as Satan or the devil \n\nAdherents of the King James Only movement and others who hold that Isaiah 14:12 does indeed refer to the devil have decried the modern translations.\n\nThose treating \"Lucifer\" as a name for Satan may use that name when speaking of such accounts of the devil or Satan as the following:\n* Satan inciting David to number Israel (1 Chronicles ), though in 2 Samuel  it is stated that God caused David to take census of Israel\n* Job tested by Satan (Book of Job)\n* Satan ready to accuse the high priest Joshua (Zechariah )\n* Sin brought into the world through the devil's envy (Wisdom )\n* \"The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience\" (Ephesians )\n* \"The god of this world\" (2 Corinthians ).\n* The devil disputing with Michael about the body of Moses (Jude )\n* The dragon of the Book of Revelation \"who is called the devil and Satan\" ()\n\nThey may also use the name \"Lucifer\" when speaking of Satan's motive for rebelling and of the nature of his sin, which, without using the name \"Lucifer\", Origen, Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine attributed to the devil's pride, and Irenaeus, Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Cyprian, and again Augustine attributed to the devil's envy of humanity created in the image of God. Jealousy of humans, created in the divine image and given authority over the world is the motive that a modern writer, who denies that there is any such person as Lucifer, says that Tertullian attributed to the devil, and, while he cited Tertullian and Augustine as giving envy as the motive for the fall, an 18th-century French Capuchin preacher himself described the rebel angel as jealous of Adam's exaltation, which he saw as a diminution of his own status.\n\nLatter-day Saints \n\nLucifer is regarded within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the pre-mortal name of the devil. Mormon theology teaches that in a heavenly council, Lucifer rebelled against the plan of God the Father and was subsequently cast out. Mormon scripture reads:\"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.\"After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer \"goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men\". Mormons consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.\n\nIslam\n\nMorning Star in Islamic legend\n\nIn Islamic and Persian teachings the Morning Star or Ishtar is called Zohra or Zohrah and were once a beautiful woman called.Muhammad Asad The Road To Mecca The Book Foundation 1954  Two fallen angels named Harut and Marut, were seduced by her beauty to commit shirk, murder, adultery and drinking wine. In their drunken state, Zohra elicited from these angels the secret words to ascend to heaven. Then she uttered the secret words, she elevated to the first heaven, but was imprisoned or transformed into Venus.William Percy William Percy's Mahomet and His Heaven: A Critical Edition Ashgate Publishing 2006  page 18\n\nIslamic account of the Devil\n\nIn Islam the Devil is known as  (, plural:  ') or  (, plural:  '). Iblis is banished from heaven for refusing to prostrate himself before Adam, which is similar to the earlier 3 Enoch, chapter 4, in which all of the angels prostrate themselves before Enoch, an early descendant of Adam. Thus, he sins after the creation of man. He asks God for seducing human to sin until judgment day as long God's curse rest on him.Mahmoud Ayoub The Qur'an and Its Interpreters , Volume 1 SUNY Press 1984  page 87 God grants this request, and Iblis then swears revenge by tempting human beings and turning them away from God. God tells him that any humans who follow him will join him in the fire of hell at judgment day, but that Iblis will have no power over all mankind except who wants to follow Iblis. QS (17:63–65) This story is cited multiple times in the Qur'an for different reasons.\n\nIslamic literature presents Iblis as God worshipping and very pious until he refused to prostrate to Adam due to his jealousy and pride.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nlNAWAgAAQBAJ&pgPA170&dq\nIslam+Iblis+jinn&hlen&sa\nX&eiSRYYVIC3F-iM7QbLkIGIDQ&ved\n0CE4Q6AEwBw#vonepage&q\nIslam%20Iblis%20jinn&ffalse Scott B.

Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious/philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nOccultism\n\nLuciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.\n\nIn Anton LaVey's The Satanic Bible, Lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell, particularly that of the East, the 'lord of the air', and is called the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment. The title 'lord of the air' is based upon Ephesians 2:2, which uses the phrase 'prince of the power of the air' to refer to the pagan god Zeus, but that phrase later became conflated with Satan.\n\nAuthor Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a \"mask\" of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.\n\nTaxil's hoax\n\nLéo Taxil (1854–1907) claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the Taxil hoax, he alleged that leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed \"The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world\" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the \"Luciferian path,\" or the \"energies of Lucifer,\" they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer,\"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 321). Much has been made of this quote ([http://www.masonicinfo.com/lucifer.htm Masonic information: Lucifer]). the search for light; the very antithesis of dark, satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly) that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the Palladium, which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda. As described by Freemasonry Disclosed in 1897:\n\nTaxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-masonic groups.\n\nIn Devil-Worship in France, Arthur Edward Waite compared Taxil's work to what today we would call a tabloid story, replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Inf. 34 Alessandro Vellutello, Lucifero (1534).jpg|Lucifer, by Alessandro Vellutello (1534), for Dante's Inferno, canto 34\nFile:Blake Hell 34 Lucifer.jpg|Lucifer, by William Blake, for Dante's Inferno, canto 34\nFile:ParadiseLButts1.jpg|Satan/Lucifer arousing rebel angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, by William Blake\nFile:Lucifero.gif|Cover of 1887 edition of Mario Rapisardi's poem Lucifero\nFile:Zichy,Mihaly - Lucifer az urral szemben (Madach).jpg|Lucifer before the Lord, by Mihály Zichy (19th century)\nFile:Punchinello Mayor Hall.png|Mayor Hall and Lucifer, by an unknown artist (1870)\nFile:Paradise Lost 12.jpg|Gustave Doré's illustration for [http://www.danshort.com/pl/page1.php?p=12 Milton's Paradise Lost, III, 739–742: Satan on his way to bring about the fall of man]\nFile:Paradise Lost 19.jpg|Gustave Doré's illustration for [http://www.danshort.com/pl/page1.php?p=19 Milton's Paradise Lost, V, 1006–1015: Satan yielding before Gabriel].
