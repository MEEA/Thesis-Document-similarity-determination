He is known internationally for his roles in Mephisto (1981), Never Say Never Again (1983) and Out of Africa (1985).\n\nPersonal life\n\nBrandauer was born as Klaus Georg Steng in Bad Aussee, Austria. He is the son of Maria Brandauer and Georg Steng (or Stenj), a civil servant.[http://www.filmreference.com/film/0/Klaus-Maria-Brandauer.html Klaus Maria Brandauer Film Reference biography] He subsequently took his mother's maiden name  as  part of his professional name, Klaus Maria Brandauer.\n\nCareer\n\nBrandauer began acting on stage in 1962. After working in national theatre and television, he made his film debut in English in 1972, in Ingo Preminger's Saltzburg Connection. In 1975 he played in Derrick – in Season 2, Episode 8 called \"Pfandhaus\". His starring and award-winning role in István Szabó's Mephisto (1981) playing a self-absorbed actor, launched his international career.\n\nFollowing his role in Mephisto, Brandauer appeared as Maximillian Largo in  Never Say Never Again (1983),  a remake of the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball. Roger Ebert said of his performance: \"For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. Brandauer is a wonderful actor, and he chooses not to play the villain as a cliché. Instead, he brings a certain poignancy and charm to Largo, and since Connery always has been a particularly human James Bond, the emotional stakes are more convincing this time.\" He starred in Out of Africa (1985), opposite Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, for which he was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe, and Szabó's Oberst Redl (1985). \n\nIn 1987, he was the Head of the Jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nIn 1988 he appeared in Hanussen opposite Erland Josephson and Ildikó Bánsági. Brandauer was originally cast as Marko Ramius in The Hunt for Red October. That role eventually went to Oscar nominee Sean Connery, who played James Bond to Brandauer's Largo in Never Say Never Again (1983). He co-starred with Connery again in The Russia House (1990).\n\nBrandauer directed his first film in 1989, ', with himself in the title role. His other film roles have been in The Lightship (1986), Streets of Gold (1986), Burning Secret (1988), The Russia House (1990), White Fang (1991), Becoming Colette (1992), Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), and Everyman's Feast (2002). In 1989 he participated in the great production film for the bicentennial of the French Revolution by the French television channel TF1, La Révolution française: He played the role of Georges Danton.\n\nIn August 2006, Brandauer's much-awaited production of The Threepenny Opera gained a mixed reception. Brandauer had resisted questions about how his production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's classic musical comedy about the criminal MacHeath would differ from earlier versions, and his production featured Mack the Knife in a three-piece suit and white gloves, stuck to Brecht's text, and avoided any references to contemporary politics or issues.\n\nBrandauer has at least a working knowledge of five languages: German, Italian, Hungarian, English and French and has acted in each.\n\nFamily\n\nHis first wife was Karin Katharina Müller (14 October 1945 – 13 November 1992), an Austrian film and television director and screenwriter, from 1963 until her death in 1992, aged 47, from cancer. Both were teenagers when they married, in 1963. They had one son.
