  "textBody" : "Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was an American former Marine and Marxist who assassinated United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. According to four federal government investigations and one municipal investigation,These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Oswald shot and killed Kennedy from a sniper's nest as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in the city of Dallas, Texas.\n\nOswald was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959. He lived in the Belarusian city of Minsk until June 1962, at which time he returned to the United States with his Russian wife Marina and eventually settled in Dallas.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after Oswald fatally shot Kennedy, he shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit on a local street. Oswald then slipped into a movie theatre, where he was arrested for Tippit's murder. Oswald was later charged with the murder of Kennedy. He denied shooting anybody, saying that he was a \"patsy\".[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZYAIiErTNg Lee Oswald claiming innocence (film)], Youtube.comWarren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3—Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination] Two days later, Oswald was in the process of being transferred from the city jail to the county jail when he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.\n\nIn September 1964, the Warren Commission released its findings and concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas School Book Depository. This conclusion was supported by previous investigations carried out by the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Despite forensic, ballistic, and eyewitness evidence supporting the lone gunman theory, public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that most Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone, but conspired with others to kill the president. The assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\n\nOswald was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1939, to Robert Edward Lee Oswald, Sr. (1896–1939) and Marguerite Frances Claverie (1907–1981). Robert Oswald was a distant cousin of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and a veteran of World War I. Robert died of a heart attack two months before Lee was born.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 799, CE 1963, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0415b.htm Schedule showing known addresses of Lee Harvey Oswald from the time of his birth]. Lee's elder brother Robert, Jr. (1934–2017) was also a former Marine. Through Marguerite's first marriage to Edward John Pic, Jr., Lee and Robert Jr. were the half-brothers of Air Force veteran John Edward Pic (1932 – 2000).\n\nIn 1944, Marguerite moved the family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. Oswald entered the 1st grade in 1945 and over the next half-dozen years attended several different schools in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas through the 6th grade. Oswald took an IQ test in the 4th grade and scored 103; \"on achievement tests in [grades 4 to 6], he twice did best in reading and twice did worst in spelling.\"\n\nAs a child, Oswald was described as withdrawn and temperamental by several people who knew him. When Oswald was 12 in August 1952, his mother took him to New York City where they lived for a short time with Oswald's half-brother, John. Oswald and his mother were later asked to leave after an argument in which Oswald allegedly struck his mother and threatened John's wife with a pocket knife.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 687, CE 1382, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0359a.htm Interview with Mrs. John Edward Pic].\n\nOswald attended the 7th grade in the Bronx, New York, but was often truant, which led to a psychiatric assessment at a juvenile reformatory. The reformatory psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, described Oswald as immersed in a \"vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which [Oswald] tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations.\" Dr. Hartogs detected a \"personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive-aggressive tendencies\" and recommended continued treatment.\n\nIn January 1954, Marguerite returned to New Orleans and took Lee with her. At the time, there was a question pending before a New York judge as to whether Oswald should be removed from the care of his mother to finish his schooling,Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/2_12_64_AM.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].\nalthough Oswald's behavior appeared to improve during his last months in New York.[http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo3/exhibits/carro1.htm Carro Exhibit No. 1 Continued] at Kennedy Assassination Home Page.Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/carro.htm Testimony of John Carro].\n\nOswald completed the 8th and 9th grades in New Orleans.  He entered the 10th grade in 1955 but quit school after one month. After leaving school, Oswald worked for several months as an office clerk and messenger in New Orleans. In July 1956, Oswald's mother moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas, and Oswald re-enrolled in the 10th grade for the September session at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth. A few weeks later in October, Oswald quit school at age 17 to join the Marines (see below); he never earned a high school diploma.\n\nBy the age of 17, he had resided at 22 different locations and attended 12 different schools.\nThe schools were: \n* 1st grade: Benbrook Common School (Fort Worth, Texas), October 31, 1945\n* 1st grade (again): Covington Elementary School (Covington, Louisiana), Sep. 1946–Jan. 1947\n* 1st grade (end): Clayton Public School (Ft Worth, TX), Jan.–May 1947\n* 2nd grade: Clayton Public School (Ft Worth, TX), Sept. 1947\n* 2nd grade (end): Clark Elementary School (Ft Worth, TX), March 1948\n* 3rd grade: Arlington Heights Elementary School (Ft Worth, TX), Sept. 1948\n* 4th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (since renamed Luella Merrett, Ft Worth), Sep. 1949\n* 5th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (Ft Worth), Sep. 1950\n* 6th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (Ft Worth), Sep. 1951\n* 7th grade: Trinity Evangelical Lutheran School (Bronx, NYC, NY), Aug. 1952\n* 7th grade: Public School 117 (Bronx, NY), Sep. 1952 (attended 17 of 64 days)\n* 7th grade (end): Public School 44 (Bronx, NY), March 23, 1953\n: Reformatory: Youth House (NYC, NY), April/May 1953.\n* 8th grade: Public School 44 (Bronx, NY), September 14, 1953\n* 8th grade (end): Beauregard Junior High School (New Orleans), January 13, 1954\n* 9th grade: Beauregard Junior High School (New Orleans), Sep. 1954–June 1955\n* 10th grade: Warren Easton High School (New Orleans), Sep.–Oct. 1955 (Warren appendix 13)\n: (tried to enlist in U.S. Marines using affidavit claiming age 17)\n: (worked as clerk/messenger in New Orleans, rather than school)\n* 10th grade (again): Arlington Heights High School (Ft Worth, TX), Sep.–Oct. 1956. Final withdrawal from high school, 10th grade. (Warren appendix 13)\n\nThough the young Oswald had trouble spelling and may have had a \"reading-spelling disability\", he read voraciously. By age 15, he claimed to be a Marxist and wrote in his diary, \"I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries.\" At 16 he wrote to the Socialist Party of America for information on their Young People's Socialist League, saying he had been studying socialist principles for \"well over fifteen months.\"Warren Commission Hearings, CE 2240, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0085b.htm FBI transcript of letter from Lee Oswald to the Socialist Party of America, October 3, 1956].\nHowever, Edward Voebel, \"whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans..... said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying Communism' were a 'lot of baloney.' \" Voebel said that \"Oswald commonly read 'paperback trash.'\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_4_Oswald.pdf Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, vol. 9, 4, p. 107.[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0009b.htm Testimony of Edward Voebel], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 10, 12.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 235. \n\nAs a teenager in 1955, Oswald attended Civil Air Patrol meetings in New Orleans. His fellow cadets recalled him attending C.A.P. meetings \"three or four\" times, or \"10 or 12 times\" over a one- or two-month period.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0058a.htm Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 4, pp. 107–115.Summers 1998, p. 234.[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS Frontline \"Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald\"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).\n\nMarine Corps\n\nOswald enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, just after his seventeenth birthday. He was underage and his brother Robert, Jr. was required to sign the forms as his guardian. Oswald also named his mother and his half-brother John as beneficiaries. Oswald idolized his older brother, Robert Jr., and wore his Marine Corps ring. John Pic (Oswald's half-brother) testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald's enlistment was motivated by wanting \"to get from out and under ... the yoke of oppression from my mother.\"\n\nOswald's enlistment papers showed his vital statistics as 5 ft in height, 135 lb in weight, with hazel eyes and brown hair. His primary training was in radar operation, which was a position that required a security clearance. A May 1957 document stated that he was \"granted final clearance to handle classified matter up to and including confidential after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data.\"Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 665, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0342a.htm Administrative Remarks].\n\nAt Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, Oswald finished seventh in a class of thirty in the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course, which \"included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar.\" He was given the military occupational specialty of Aviation Electronics Operator. On July 9, he reported to the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro then departed for Japan the following month, where he was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron 1 at Naval Air Facility Atsugi near Tokyo.\n\nLike all marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting and he scored 212 in December 1956, slightly above the requirements for the designation of sharpshooter. In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to marksman.\n\nOswald was court-martialed after he accidentally shot himself in the elbow with an unauthorized .22 handgun. He was court-martialed a second time for fighting with a sergeant who he thought was responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was demoted from private first class to private and briefly imprisoned in the brig. Oswald was later punished for a third incident: while he was on a night-time sentry duty in the Philippines, he inexplicably fired his rifle into the jungle.Gerald Posner \"Case Closed\" Random House, New York, 1993 pg. 28\n\nSlightly built, Oswald was nicknamed Ozzie Rabbit after the cartoon character; he was also called Oswaldskovich[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/pdf/WH8_Botelho_aff.pdf Affidavit of James Botelho] because he espoused pro-Soviet sentiments. In November 1958, Oswald transferred back to El Toro where his unit's function \"was to serveil  for aircraft, but basically to train both enlisted men and officers for later assignment overseas.\" An officer there said that Oswald was a \"very competent\" crew chief and was \"brighter than most people.\"[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0149b.htm Testimony of John E. Donovan], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 290–298.Summers 1998, p. 94.\n\nWhile in the marines, Oswald made an effort to teach himself rudimentary Russian. Although this was an unusual endeavor, in February 25, 1959 he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His level at the time was rated \"poor\" in understanding spoken Russian, though he fared rather reasonably for a Marine private at the time in reading and writing.Summers 2013, pp. 140-141. The grades were -5 in understanding, +4 in reading and +3 in writing. On September 11, 1959, he received a hardship discharge from active service, claiming his mother needed care, and was put on reserve.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 85, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0373b.htm Request for Dependency Discharge].\n\nAdult life and early crimes\n\nDefection to the Soviet Union\n\nOswald traveled to the Soviet Union just before he turned 20 in October 1959; this was a trip that he had planned well in advance. Along with his self-taught Russian, he had saved $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 705, CE 1385, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0366a.htm Notes of interview of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by Aline Mosby in Moscow in November 1959]. Oswald: \"When I was working in the middle of the night on guard duty, I would think how long it would be and how much money I would have to save. It would be like being out of prison. I saved about $1500.\" During Oswald's 2 years and 10 months of service in the Marine Corps he received $3,452.20, after all taxes, allotments and other deductions as well as his GED. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, p. 709, CE 3099, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/wc/contents_wh26.htm Certified military pay records for Lee Harvey Oswald for the period October 24, 1956, to September 11, 1959].\n\nOswald spent two days with his mother in Fort Worth, then embarked by ship on September 20 from New Orleans to Le Havre, France, and immediately proceeded to the United Kingdom. Arriving in Southampton on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland. However, on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, where he was issued a Soviet visa on October 14. Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October 16.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/journey.htm The Journey From USA to USSR] at Russian Books His visa, valid only for a week, was due to expire on October 21.\n\nAlmost immediately after arriving, Oswald informed his Intourist guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen. When asked why by the various Soviet officials he encountered—all of whom, by Oswald's account, found his wish incomprehensible—he said that he was a communist, and gave what he described in his diary as \"vauge [sic] answers about 'Great Soviet Union'\".Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 94, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0059b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 16, 1959 to October 21, 1959. On October 21, the day his visa was due to expire, he was told that his citizenship application had been refused, and that he had to leave the Soviet Union that evening. Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself in a way that would shock her. Delaying Oswald's departure because of his self-inflicted injury, the Soviets kept him in a Moscow hospital under psychiatric observation until October 28, 1959.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 95, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060a.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 21, 1959 to October 28, 1959.\n\nAccording to Oswald, he met with four more Soviet officials that same day, who asked if he wanted to return to the United States. Oswald replied by insisting that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 96, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 28, 1959 to October 31, 1959.\n\nOn October 31, Oswald appeared at the United States embassy in Moscow and declared a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/moscow1.htm Moscow Part 1] at Russian Books\n\nWarren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 108, CE 912, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0061b.htm Declaration of Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 3, 1959, requesting that his U.S. citizenship be revoked].\n \"I have made up my mind,\" he said; \"I'm through.\" He told the U.S. embassy interviewing officer, Richard Edward Snyder, that \"he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed. He intimated that he might know something of special interest.\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/pdf/WH18_CE_908.pdf Foreign Service Dispatch from the American Embassy in Moscow to the Department of State], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 98, CE 908\n(Such statements led to Oswald's hardship/honorable military reserve discharge being changed to undesirable.)Warren Commission Hearings, CE 780, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/pdf/WH17_CE_780.pdf Documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's Marine Corps file].\nThe Associated Press story of the defection of a former U.S. Marine to the Soviet Union was reported on the front pages of some newspapers in 1959.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id\nIrwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid4eoFAAAAIBAJ&pg\n3310,5481990&dqlee+oswald+russia&hl\nen \"Texas Marine Gives Up U.S. For Russia\"], The Miami News, October 31, 1959, p1\n\nThough Oswald had wanted to attend Moscow State University, he was sent to Minsk to work as a lathe operator at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. Stanislau Shushkevich, who later became independent Belarus's first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time, and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian. Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay—all in all, an idyllic existence by working-class Soviet standards,Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk3.htm Minsk Part 3] at Russian Books though he was kept under constant surveillance.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk2.htm Minsk Part 2] at Russian Books\n\nFrom approximately June 1960 to February 1961, Oswald was in a personal relationship with Ella German, a co-worker at the factory. He proposed marriage to her at the beginning of 1961, but she refused with the explanation that she did not love him and was afraid to marry an American. Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have had much to do with his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.\n\nOswald wrote in his diary in January 1961: \"I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough.\" Shortly afterwards, Oswald (who had never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship) wrote to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow requesting return of his American passport, and proposing to return to the U.S. if any charges against him would be dropped.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 131, CE 931, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0073a.htm Undated letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Embassy in Moscow].\n\nIn March 1961, Oswald met Marina Prusakova, a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married less than six weeks later in April.Though later reports described her uncle, with whom she was living, as a colonel in the KGB, he was a lumber industry expert in the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) with a bureaucratic rank of Polkovnik.

On May 24, 1962, Oswald and Marina applied at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for documents that enabled her to immigrate to the U.S. On June 1, the U.S. Embassy gave Oswald a repatriation loan of $435.71.\nOswald, Marina, and their infant daughter left for the United States, where they received less attention from the press than Oswald expected, much to his disappointment.[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1962/06/09/page/101/article/marine-learns-that-the-u-s-a-dwarfs-russia \"Marine Learns That the U.S.A.

On October 12, he started working for the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee. A fellow employee at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall testified that Oswald's rudeness at his new job was such that fights threatened to break out, and that he once saw Oswald reading a Russian-language publication.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 199–205, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh10/html/WC_Vol10_0104a.htm Testimony of Dennis Hyman Ofstein].Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of Dennis Hyman Ofstein: 'I would say he didn't get along with people and that several people had words with him at times about the way he barged around the plant, and one of the fellows back in the photosetter department almost got in a fight with him one day, and I believe it was Mr. Graef that stepped in and broke it up before it got started...' Oswald was fired almost 6 months later, on the first week of April 1963.\n\nEdwin Walker assassination attempt\n\nIn March 1963, Oswald used the alias \"A. Hidell\" to make a mail-order purchase of a secondhand 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle for $29.95. He also purchased a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver by the same method.[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0296a.htm Questioned Documents], Warren Commission Report, Appendix 10, p. 567–571. On April 10, 1963, Oswald attempted to kill retired U.S. Major General Edwin Walker. He fired the Carcano rifle at Walker through a window from less than 100 ft away as Walker sat at a desk in his Dallas home.

Later, the Committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald had visited Mexico City and concluded that \"the majority of evidence tends to indicate\" that Oswald in fact visited the consulates, but the Committee could not rule out the possibility that someone else had used his name in visiting the consulates.House Select Committee on Assassinations, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/lopezrpt/html/LopezRpt_0018a.htm 1996 Release: Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City (\"Lopez Report\")], p. 121.\n\nReturn to Dallas\n\nOn October 2, 1963, Oswald left Mexico City by bus and arrived in Dallas the next day.

Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the depository and was hired there on October 16 as a $1.25 an hour minimum wage order filler. Oswald's supervisor, Roy S.

Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When he was told that Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: \"Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife\" [signed] \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\" The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to \"blow up the FBI\" or merely \"report this to higher authorities\". According to Hosty, the note said, \"If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities.\" Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0113a.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 195–196.Summers 1998, pp. 283–286.\n\nJohn F.

One shot apparently missed the presidential limousine entirely, another struck both Kennedy and Connally, and a third bullet struck Kennedy in the head, killing him. Bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from a small piece of curbstone that had fragmented after it was struck by one of the bullets.\n\nHoward Brennan was a steamfitter who was sitting across the street from the Texas School Book Depository and watching the motorcade go by.

About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald encountered police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn,  in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee.

Four cartridge cases found at the scene were identified by expert witnesses before the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee as having been fired from the revolver later found in Oswald's possession, to the exclusion of all other weapons. However, the bullets taken from Tippit's body could not be positively identified as having been fired from Oswald's revolver as the bullets were too extensively damaged to make conclusive assessments.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 466–473, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0237b.htm Testimony of Cortlandt Cunningham].

Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that he was the first to reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to surrender saying, \"Well, it is all over now.\" McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed.Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.jfk-assassination.com/warren/wch/vol3/page295.php Testimony of M. N.

Retrieved June 21, 2011.\n\nAt about 2 p.m., Oswald arrived at the Police Department building, where homicide detective Jim Leavelle (1920–) questioned him about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the book depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh21/html/WH_Vol21_0268b.htm Copy of an undated statement made by Richard M.

Oswald declared, \"I didn't shoot anybody\" and, \"They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!\" Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, \"Did you kill the President?\" and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, \"No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.\" As he was led from the room the question was called out, \"What did you do in Russia?\" and, \"How did you hurt your eye?\"; Oswald answered, \"A policeman hit me.\"Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3 – Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination].., YouTube.com.\n\nPolice interrogation\n\nOswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 66.  However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an \"A. J. Hidell\". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, \"Alek James Hidell\" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying \"you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do.\"[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/contents/wc/contents_wh17.htm vol.

Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) conducted the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the \"domino room\"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0238a.htm Testimony of James P.

Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two \"Negro employees\" walking by, one he recognized as \"Junior\" and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had \"walked through\" the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.Summers 1998, p. 59. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was at the time of the shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0153a.htm Testimony of Harry D.

When H. Louis Nichols, President of the Dallas Bar Association, met with him in his cell on Saturday, he declined their services, saying he wanted to be represented by John Abt, chief counsel to the Communist Party USA, or by lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0168b.htm Testimony of H.

Holmes\n\nDeath\n\nOn Sunday, November 24, Oswald was being escorted by detectives through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was to take him from the city jail (located on the fourth floor of police headquarters) to the nearby county jail. At 11:21 a.m. CST, Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby stepped from the crowd and shot Oswald once in the abdomen at close range.The Nook: An Investigation of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, [http://www.jmasland.com/cat_content.asp?contentid\n108 Official Autopsy Report of Lee Harvey Oswald], November 24, 1963. Accessed January 9, 2013. Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 p.m. Dallas police chief Jesse Curry announced Oswald's death on a TV news broadcast.\n\nAt 2:45 p.m. the same day, an autopsy was performed on Oswald in the Office of the County Medical Examiner. Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose said: \"The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male.\" Rose's examination found that the bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.\n\nA network television pool camera was there to cover the transfer and was broadcasting live; millions of people who were watching on NBC witnessed the shooting as it happened and on other networks within minutes afterward. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the Dallas Times Herald was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.\n\nRuby's motive\n\nRuby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was \"saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial.\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200. Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel \nfor the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: \"The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.\"\n\nBurial\n\nOswald was buried on November 25 in Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth.[http://jfkassassination.net/parnell/grave.htm Directions to Lee Harvey Oswald's Grave] at Kennedy Assassination Home Page Reporters who were present to report on the burial were asked by officials to act as pallbearers.[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57162874-68/oswald-fort-lee-worth.html.csp Lee Harvey Oswald pallbearer recalls the weather and widow] The Salt Lake Tribune, November 21, 2013. A marker inscribed simply Oswald replaced the stolen original tombstone, which gave Oswald's full name, and birth and death dates. His mother was buried beside him in 1981.\n\nA claim that a look-alike Russian agent was buried in place of Oswald led to his exhumation on October 4, 1981. Dental records confirmed that it was Oswald's body in the grave and he was reburied in a new coffin due to water damage to the original.\n\nIn 2010, the Fort Worth funeral home that held Oswald's original coffin employed a Los Angeles auction house to sell it to an undisclosed bidder for $87,468. The sale was halted after Oswald's brother, Robert, learned of the transaction in a Texas newspaper and sued to reclaim the coffin. In January 2015, a district judge in Tarrant County, Texas ruled that the funeral home intentionally concealed the existence of the pine coffin from Robert Oswald who had originally purchased it and believed that it had been discarded after the exhumation. The court ordered it returned to Oswald's brother, plus damages equal to the sale price. Robert Oswald's attorney stated that the coffin would likely be destroyed \"as soon as possible\".\n\nOfficial investigations\n\nWarren Commission\n\nNew President Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that created The Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, and the Warren Report could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:\n\nThe proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret, and about 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.\"Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing...Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and all of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission.\" (Bugliosi, p. 332)\n\nRamsey Clark Panel\n\nIn 1968, the Ramsey Clark Panel examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence, concluding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/clark.txt 1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John E Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas]  (.txt) at Kennedy Assassination Home Page\n\nHouse Select Committee\n\nIn 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.Bugliosi, Reclaiming History, p. 376 However, late in the Committee's proceedings a dictabelt recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired. After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a \"high probability that two gunmen fired\" at Kennedy and that Kennedy \"was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.\" Although the Committee was \"unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy,\" it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0005a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] HSCA Final Report, p. 3.

Their conclusions were later published in the journal Science.\n\nIn a 2001 article in the journal Science & Justice, D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.Donald B.

Retrieved April 10, 2010. In 2005, Thomas's conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.Linsker R., Garwin R.L., Chernoff H., Horowitz P., Ramsey N.F., [http://jfk-records.com/ScienceAndJustice_45%284%29_207-226%282005%29.pdf \"Synchronization of the acoustic evidence in the assassination of President Kennedy\"].

Thomas challenged in a book the 2005 Science & Justice article and restated his conclusion that there were at least two gunmen.\n\nBackyard photos\n\nThe \"backyard photos\", taken by Marina Oswald probably around March 31, 1963 using a camera belonging to Oswald, show Oswald holding two Marxist newspapers—The Militant and The Worker—and a rifle, and wearing a pistol in a holster. Oswald was shown the pictures after his arrest and insisted that they were forgeries, but Marina testified in 1964 that she had taken the photographs at Oswald's request—Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 15, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0014a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]. testimony she reaffirmed repeatedly over the decades.\n*[http://www.jfk-online.com/marinashaw2.html Testimony of Marina Oswald Porter], Trial of Clay Shaw, Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, February 21, 1969.\n*United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/jfkinfo4/jfk12/marinade.htm#maraug Deposition of Marina Oswald Porter] (1977):\nQ.

CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B. Oswald's mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with \"To my daughter June\" written on it.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 146, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0079b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].\n\nThe HSCA obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of George de Mohrenschildt.

Also in English were added in script: \"To my friend George, Lee Oswald, 5/IV/63 [April 5, 1963].\"HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, p. 151, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm Figure IV-21]. Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald. After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.\n\nThese photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0072b.htm \"The Oswald Backyard Photographs\"] Photographic experts consulted by the HSCA concluded they were genuine, answering twenty-one points raised by critics. Marina Oswald has always maintained she took the photos herself, and the 1963 de Mohrenschildt print bearing Oswald's signature clearly indicate they existed before the assassination. Nonetheless, some continue to contest their authenticity.United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo/hscawhte.htm Testimony of Jack D. White]. In 2009, after digitally analyzing the photograph of Oswald holding the rifle and paper, computer scientist Hany Farid concluded that the photo \"almost certainly was not altered.\"\n\nOther investigations and dissenting theories\n\n \n\nSome critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed.\n\nPublic opinion\n\nA Gallup Poll taken in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed that Kennedy was killed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald acted alone.\n\nCriminal trial\n\nOswald was never prosecuted because he was murdered two days after the killings of Kennedy and Tippit. In March 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others. Garrison believed that the men were part of an arms smuggling ring supplying weapons to the anti-Castro Cubans in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA to kill Kennedy.  The trial of Clay Shaw began in January 1969 in Orleans Parish Criminal Court. The jury acquitted Shaw.\n\nFictional trials\n\nSeveral films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald, depicting what may have happened had Ruby not killed Oswald. The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964); The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977); and On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald (1986) have imagined such a trial. In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a  judge,Bugliosi, Reclaiming History with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty. In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials. The first trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was an American former Marine and Marxist who assassinated United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. According to four federal government investigations and one municipal investigation,These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Oswald shot and killed Kennedy from a sniper's nest as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in the city of Dallas, Texas.\n\nOswald was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959. He lived in the Belarusian city of Minsk until June 1962, at which time he returned to the United States with his Russian wife Marina and eventually settled in Dallas.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after Oswald fatally shot Kennedy, he shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit on a local street. Oswald then slipped into a movie theatre, where he was arrested for Tippit's murder. Oswald was later charged with the murder of Kennedy. He denied shooting anybody, saying that he was a \"patsy\".[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZYAIiErTNg Lee Oswald claiming innocence (film)], Youtube.comWarren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3—Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination] Two days later, Oswald was in the process of being transferred from the city jail to the county jail when he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.\n\nIn September 1964, the Warren Commission released its findings and concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas School Book Depository. This conclusion was supported by previous investigations carried out by the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Despite forensic, ballistic, and eyewitness evidence supporting the lone gunman theory, public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that most Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone, but conspired with others to kill the president. The assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\n\nOswald was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1939, to Robert Edward Lee Oswald, Sr. (1896–1939) and Marguerite Frances Claverie (1907–1981). Robert Oswald was a distant cousin of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and a veteran of World War I. Robert died of a heart attack two months before Lee was born.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 799, CE 1963, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0415b.htm Schedule showing known addresses of Lee Harvey Oswald from the time of his birth]. Lee's elder brother Robert, Jr. (1934–2017) was also a former Marine. Through Marguerite's first marriage to Edward John Pic, Jr., Lee and Robert Jr. were the half-brothers of Air Force veteran John Edward Pic (1932 – 2000).\n\nIn 1944, Marguerite moved the family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. Oswald entered the 1st grade in 1945 and over the next half-dozen years attended several different schools in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas through the 6th grade. Oswald took an IQ test in the 4th grade and scored 103; \"on achievement tests in [grades 4 to 6], he twice did best in reading and twice did worst in spelling.\"\n\nAs a child, Oswald was described as withdrawn and temperamental by several people who knew him. When Oswald was 12 in August 1952, his mother took him to New York City where they lived for a short time with Oswald's half-brother, John. Oswald and his mother were later asked to leave after an argument in which Oswald allegedly struck his mother and threatened John's wife with a pocket knife.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 687, CE 1382, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0359a.htm Interview with Mrs. John Edward Pic].\n\nOswald attended the 7th grade in the Bronx, New York, but was often truant, which led to a psychiatric assessment at a juvenile reformatory. The reformatory psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, described Oswald as immersed in a \"vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which [Oswald] tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations.\" Dr. Hartogs detected a \"personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive-aggressive tendencies\" and recommended continued treatment.\n\nIn January 1954, Marguerite returned to New Orleans and took Lee with her. At the time, there was a question pending before a New York judge as to whether Oswald should be removed from the care of his mother to finish his schooling,Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/2_12_64_AM.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].\nalthough Oswald's behavior appeared to improve during his last months in New York.[http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo3/exhibits/carro1.htm Carro Exhibit No. 1 Continued] at Kennedy Assassination Home Page.Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/carro.htm Testimony of John Carro].\n\nOswald completed the 8th and 9th grades in New Orleans.  He entered the 10th grade in 1955 but quit school after one month. After leaving school, Oswald worked for several months as an office clerk and messenger in New Orleans. In July 1956, Oswald's mother moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas, and Oswald re-enrolled in the 10th grade for the September session at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth. A few weeks later in October, Oswald quit school at age 17 to join the Marines (see below); he never earned a high school diploma.\n\nBy the age of 17, he had resided at 22 different locations and attended 12 different schools.\nThe schools were: \n* 1st grade: Benbrook Common School (Fort Worth, Texas), October 31, 1945\n* 1st grade (again): Covington Elementary School (Covington, Louisiana), Sep. 1946–Jan. 1947\n* 1st grade (end): Clayton Public School (Ft Worth, TX), Jan.–May 1947\n* 2nd grade: Clayton Public School (Ft Worth, TX), Sept. 1947\n* 2nd grade (end): Clark Elementary School (Ft Worth, TX), March 1948\n* 3rd grade: Arlington Heights Elementary School (Ft Worth, TX), Sept. 1948\n* 4th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (since renamed Luella Merrett, Ft Worth), Sep. 1949\n* 5th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (Ft Worth), Sep. 1950\n* 6th grade: Ridglea West Elementary School (Ft Worth), Sep. 1951\n* 7th grade: Trinity Evangelical Lutheran School (Bronx, NYC, NY), Aug. 1952\n* 7th grade: Public School 117 (Bronx, NY), Sep. 1952 (attended 17 of 64 days)\n* 7th grade (end): Public School 44 (Bronx, NY), March 23, 1953\n: Reformatory: Youth House (NYC, NY), April/May 1953.\n* 8th grade: Public School 44 (Bronx, NY), September 14, 1953\n* 8th grade (end): Beauregard Junior High School (New Orleans), January 13, 1954\n* 9th grade: Beauregard Junior High School (New Orleans), Sep. 1954–June 1955\n* 10th grade: Warren Easton High School (New Orleans), Sep.–Oct. 1955 (Warren appendix 13)\n: (tried to enlist in U.S. Marines using affidavit claiming age 17)\n: (worked as clerk/messenger in New Orleans, rather than school)\n* 10th grade (again): Arlington Heights High School (Ft Worth, TX), Sep.–Oct. 1956. Final withdrawal from high school, 10th grade. (Warren appendix 13)\n\nThough the young Oswald had trouble spelling and may have had a \"reading-spelling disability\", he read voraciously. By age 15, he claimed to be a Marxist and wrote in his diary, \"I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries.\" At 16 he wrote to the Socialist Party of America for information on their Young People's Socialist League, saying he had been studying socialist principles for \"well over fifteen months.\"Warren Commission Hearings, CE 2240, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0085b.htm FBI transcript of letter from Lee Oswald to the Socialist Party of America, October 3, 1956].\nHowever, Edward Voebel, \"whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans..... said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying Communism' were a 'lot of baloney.' \" Voebel said that \"Oswald commonly read 'paperback trash.'\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_4_Oswald.pdf Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, vol. 9, 4, p. 107.[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0009b.htm Testimony of Edward Voebel], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 10, 12.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 235. \n\nAs a teenager in 1955, Oswald attended Civil Air Patrol meetings in New Orleans. His fellow cadets recalled him attending C.A.P. meetings \"three or four\" times, or \"10 or 12 times\" over a one- or two-month period.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0058a.htm Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 4, pp. 107–115.Summers 1998, p. 234.[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS Frontline \"Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald\"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).\n\nMarine Corps\n\nOswald enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, just after his seventeenth birthday. He was underage and his brother Robert, Jr. was required to sign the forms as his guardian. Oswald also named his mother and his half-brother John as beneficiaries. Oswald idolized his older brother, Robert Jr., and wore his Marine Corps ring. John Pic (Oswald's half-brother) testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald's enlistment was motivated by wanting \"to get from out and under ... the yoke of oppression from my mother.\"\n\nOswald's enlistment papers showed his vital statistics as 5 ft in height, 135 lb in weight, with hazel eyes and brown hair. His primary training was in radar operation, which was a position that required a security clearance. A May 1957 document stated that he was \"granted final clearance to handle classified matter up to and including confidential after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data.\"Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 665, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0342a.htm Administrative Remarks].\n\nAt Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, Oswald finished seventh in a class of thirty in the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course, which \"included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar.\" He was given the military occupational specialty of Aviation Electronics Operator. On July 9, he reported to the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro then departed for Japan the following month, where he was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron 1 at Naval Air Facility Atsugi near Tokyo.\n\nLike all marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting and he scored 212 in December 1956, slightly above the requirements for the designation of sharpshooter. In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to marksman.\n\nOswald was court-martialed after he accidentally shot himself in the elbow with an unauthorized .22 handgun. He was court-martialed a second time for fighting with a sergeant who he thought was responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was demoted from private first class to private and briefly imprisoned in the brig. Oswald was later punished for a third incident: while he was on a night-time sentry duty in the Philippines, he inexplicably fired his rifle into the jungle.Gerald Posner \"Case Closed\" Random House, New York, 1993 pg. 28\n\nSlightly built, Oswald was nicknamed Ozzie Rabbit after the cartoon character; he was also called Oswaldskovich[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/pdf/WH8_Botelho_aff.pdf Affidavit of James Botelho] because he espoused pro-Soviet sentiments. In November 1958, Oswald transferred back to El Toro where his unit's function \"was to serveil  for aircraft, but basically to train both enlisted men and officers for later assignment overseas.\" An officer there said that Oswald was a \"very competent\" crew chief and was \"brighter than most people.\"[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0149b.htm Testimony of John E. Donovan], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 290–298.Summers 1998, p. 94.\n\nWhile in the marines, Oswald made an effort to teach himself rudimentary Russian. Although this was an unusual endeavor, in February 25, 1959 he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His level at the time was rated \"poor\" in understanding spoken Russian, though he fared rather reasonably for a Marine private at the time in reading and writing.Summers 2013, pp. 140-141. The grades were -5 in understanding, +4 in reading and +3 in writing. On September 11, 1959, he received a hardship discharge from active service, claiming his mother needed care, and was put on reserve.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 85, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0373b.htm Request for Dependency Discharge].\n\nAdult life and early crimes\n\nDefection to the Soviet Union\n\nOswald traveled to the Soviet Union just before he turned 20 in October 1959; this was a trip that he had planned well in advance. Along with his self-taught Russian, he had saved $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 705, CE 1385, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0366a.htm Notes of interview of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by Aline Mosby in Moscow in November 1959]. Oswald: \"When I was working in the middle of the night on guard duty, I would think how long it would be and how much money I would have to save. It would be like being out of prison. I saved about $1500.\" During Oswald's 2 years and 10 months of service in the Marine Corps he received $3,452.20, after all taxes, allotments and other deductions as well as his GED. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, p. 709, CE 3099, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/wc/contents_wh26.htm Certified military pay records for Lee Harvey Oswald for the period October 24, 1956, to September 11, 1959].\n\nOswald spent two days with his mother in Fort Worth, then embarked by ship on September 20 from New Orleans to Le Havre, France, and immediately proceeded to the United Kingdom. Arriving in Southampton on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland. However, on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, where he was issued a Soviet visa on October 14. Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October 16.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/journey.htm The Journey From USA to USSR] at Russian Books His visa, valid only for a week, was due to expire on October 21.\n\nAlmost immediately after arriving, Oswald informed his Intourist guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen. When asked why by the various Soviet officials he encountered—all of whom, by Oswald's account, found his wish incomprehensible—he said that he was a communist, and gave what he described in his diary as \"vauge [sic] answers about 'Great Soviet Union'\".Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 94, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0059b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 16, 1959 to October 21, 1959. On October 21, the day his visa was due to expire, he was told that his citizenship application had been refused, and that he had to leave the Soviet Union that evening. Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself in a way that would shock her. Delaying Oswald's departure because of his self-inflicted injury, the Soviets kept him in a Moscow hospital under psychiatric observation until October 28, 1959.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 95, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060a.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 21, 1959 to October 28, 1959.\n\nAccording to Oswald, he met with four more Soviet officials that same day, who asked if he wanted to return to the United States. Oswald replied by insisting that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 96, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Historic Diary\"], entries of October 28, 1959 to October 31, 1959.\n\nOn October 31, Oswald appeared at the United States embassy in Moscow and declared a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/moscow1.htm Moscow Part 1] at Russian Books\n\nWarren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 108, CE 912, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0061b.htm Declaration of Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 3, 1959, requesting that his U.S. citizenship be revoked].\n \"I have made up my mind,\" he said; \"I'm through.\" He told the U.S. embassy interviewing officer, Richard Edward Snyder, that \"he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed. He intimated that he might know something of special interest.\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/pdf/WH18_CE_908.pdf Foreign Service Dispatch from the American Embassy in Moscow to the Department of State], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 98, CE 908\n(Such statements led to Oswald's hardship/honorable military reserve discharge being changed to undesirable.)Warren Commission Hearings, CE 780, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/pdf/WH17_CE_780.pdf Documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's Marine Corps file].\nThe Associated Press story of the defection of a former U.S. Marine to the Soviet Union was reported on the front pages of some newspapers in 1959.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id\nIrwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid4eoFAAAAIBAJ&pg\n3310,5481990&dqlee+oswald+russia&hl\nen \"Texas Marine Gives Up U.S. For Russia\"], The Miami News, October 31, 1959, p1\n\nThough Oswald had wanted to attend Moscow State University, he was sent to Minsk to work as a lathe operator at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. Stanislau Shushkevich, who later became independent Belarus's first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time, and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian. Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay—all in all, an idyllic existence by working-class Soviet standards,Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk3.htm Minsk Part 3] at Russian Books though he was kept under constant surveillance.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk2.htm Minsk Part 2] at Russian Books\n\nFrom approximately June 1960 to February 1961, Oswald was in a personal relationship with Ella German, a co-worker at the factory. He proposed marriage to her at the beginning of 1961, but she refused with the explanation that she did not love him and was afraid to marry an American. Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have had much to do with his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.\n\nOswald wrote in his diary in January 1961: \"I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough.\" Shortly afterwards, Oswald (who had never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship) wrote to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow requesting return of his American passport, and proposing to return to the U.S. if any charges against him would be dropped.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 131, CE 931, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0073a.htm Undated letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Embassy in Moscow].\n\nIn March 1961, Oswald met Marina Prusakova, a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married less than six weeks later in April.Though later reports described her uncle, with whom she was living, as a colonel in the KGB, he was a lumber industry expert in the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) with a bureaucratic rank of Polkovnik.

On May 24, 1962, Oswald and Marina applied at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for documents that enabled her to immigrate to the U.S. On June 1, the U.S. Embassy gave Oswald a repatriation loan of $435.71.\nOswald, Marina, and their infant daughter left for the United States, where they received less attention from the press than Oswald expected, much to his disappointment.[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1962/06/09/page/101/article/marine-learns-that-the-u-s-a-dwarfs-russia \"Marine Learns That the U.S.A.

On October 12, he started working for the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee. A fellow employee at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall testified that Oswald's rudeness at his new job was such that fights threatened to break out, and that he once saw Oswald reading a Russian-language publication.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 199–205, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh10/html/WC_Vol10_0104a.htm Testimony of Dennis Hyman Ofstein].Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of Dennis Hyman Ofstein: 'I would say he didn't get along with people and that several people had words with him at times about the way he barged around the plant, and one of the fellows back in the photosetter department almost got in a fight with him one day, and I believe it was Mr. Graef that stepped in and broke it up before it got started...' Oswald was fired almost 6 months later, on the first week of April 1963.\n\nEdwin Walker assassination attempt\n\nIn March 1963, Oswald used the alias \"A. Hidell\" to make a mail-order purchase of a secondhand 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle for $29.95. He also purchased a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver by the same method.[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0296a.htm Questioned Documents], Warren Commission Report, Appendix 10, p. 567–571. On April 10, 1963, Oswald attempted to kill retired U.S. Major General Edwin Walker. He fired the Carcano rifle at Walker through a window from less than 100 ft away as Walker sat at a desk in his Dallas home. The bullet struck the window-frame and Walker's only injuries were bullet fragments to the forearm.

Later, the Committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald had visited Mexico City and concluded that \"the majority of evidence tends to indicate\" that Oswald in fact visited the consulates, but the Committee could not rule out the possibility that someone else had used his name in visiting the consulates.House Select Committee on Assassinations, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/lopezrpt/html/LopezRpt_0018a.htm 1996 Release: Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City (\"Lopez Report\")], p. 121.\n\nReturn to Dallas\n\nOn October 2, 1963, Oswald left Mexico City by bus and arrived in Dallas the next day.

Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the depository and was hired there on October 16 as a $1.25 an hour minimum wage order filler. Oswald's supervisor, Roy S.

Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When he was told that Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: \"Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife\" [signed] \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\" The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to \"blow up the FBI\" or merely \"report this to higher authorities\". According to Hosty, the note said, \"If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities.\" Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0113a.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 195–196.Summers 1998, pp. 283–286.\n\nJohn F.

One shot apparently missed the presidential limousine entirely, another struck both Kennedy and Connally, and a third bullet struck Kennedy in the head, killing him. Bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from a small piece of curbstone that had fragmented after it was struck by one of the bullets.\n\nHoward Brennan was a steamfitter who was sitting across the street from the Texas School Book Depository and watching the motorcade go by.

About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald encountered police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn,  in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee.

Four cartridge cases found at the scene were identified by expert witnesses before the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee as having been fired from the revolver later found in Oswald's possession, to the exclusion of all other weapons. However, the bullets taken from Tippit's body could not be positively identified as having been fired from Oswald's revolver as the bullets were too extensively damaged to make conclusive assessments.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 466–473, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0237b.htm Testimony of Cortlandt Cunningham].

Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that he was the first to reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to surrender saying, \"Well, it is all over now.\" McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed.Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.jfk-assassination.com/warren/wch/vol3/page295.php Testimony of M. N.

Retrieved June 21, 2011.\n\nAt about 2 p.m., Oswald arrived at the Police Department building, where homicide detective Jim Leavelle (1920–) questioned him about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the book depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh21/html/WH_Vol21_0268b.htm Copy of an undated statement made by Richard M.

Oswald declared, \"I didn't shoot anybody\" and, \"They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!\" Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, \"Did you kill the President?\" and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, \"No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.\" As he was led from the room the question was called out, \"What did you do in Russia?\" and, \"How did you hurt your eye?\"; Oswald answered, \"A policeman hit me.\"Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3 – Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination].., YouTube.com.\n\nPolice interrogation\n\nOswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 66.  However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an \"A. J. Hidell\". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, \"Alek James Hidell\" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying \"you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do.\"[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/contents/wc/contents_wh17.htm vol.

Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) conducted the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the \"domino room\"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0238a.htm Testimony of James P.

Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two \"Negro employees\" walking by, one he recognized as \"Junior\" and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had \"walked through\" the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.Summers 1998, p. 59. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was at the time of the shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0153a.htm Testimony of Harry D.

When H. Louis Nichols, President of the Dallas Bar Association, met with him in his cell on Saturday, he declined their services, saying he wanted to be represented by John Abt, chief counsel to the Communist Party USA, or by lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0168b.htm Testimony of H.

Holmes\n\nDeath\n\nOn Sunday, November 24, Oswald was being escorted by detectives through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was to take him from the city jail (located on the fourth floor of police headquarters) to the nearby county jail. At 11:21 a.m. CST, Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby stepped from the crowd and shot Oswald once in the abdomen at close range.The Nook: An Investigation of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, [http://www.jmasland.com/cat_content.asp?contentid\n108 Official Autopsy Report of Lee Harvey Oswald], November 24, 1963. Accessed January 9, 2013. Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 p.m. Dallas police chief Jesse Curry announced Oswald's death on a TV news broadcast.\n\nAt 2:45 p.m. the same day, an autopsy was performed on Oswald in the Office of the County Medical Examiner. Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose said: \"The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male.\" Rose's examination found that the bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.\n\nA network television pool camera was there to cover the transfer and was broadcasting live; millions of people who were watching on NBC witnessed the shooting as it happened and on other networks within minutes afterward. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the Dallas Times Herald was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.\n\nRuby's motive\n\nRuby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was \"saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial.\"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200. Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel \nfor the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: \"The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.\"\n\nBurial\n\nOswald was buried on November 25 in Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth.[http://jfkassassination.net/parnell/grave.htm Directions to Lee Harvey Oswald's Grave] at Kennedy Assassination Home Page Reporters who were present to report on the burial were asked by officials to act as pallbearers.[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57162874-68/oswald-fort-lee-worth.html.csp Lee Harvey Oswald pallbearer recalls the weather and widow] The Salt Lake Tribune, November 21, 2013. A marker inscribed simply Oswald replaced the stolen original tombstone, which gave Oswald's full name, and birth and death dates. His mother was buried beside him in 1981.\n\nA claim that a look-alike Russian agent was buried in place of Oswald led to his exhumation on October 4, 1981. Dental records confirmed that it was Oswald's body in the grave and he was reburied in a new coffin due to water damage to the original.\n\nIn 2010, the Fort Worth funeral home that held Oswald's original coffin employed a Los Angeles auction house to sell it to an undisclosed bidder for $87,468. The sale was halted after Oswald's brother, Robert, learned of the transaction in a Texas newspaper and sued to reclaim the coffin. In January 2015, a district judge in Tarrant County, Texas ruled that the funeral home intentionally concealed the existence of the pine coffin from Robert Oswald who had originally purchased it and believed that it had been discarded after the exhumation. The court ordered it returned to Oswald's brother, plus damages equal to the sale price. Robert Oswald's attorney stated that the coffin would likely be destroyed \"as soon as possible\".\n\nOfficial investigations\n\nWarren Commission\n\nNew President Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that created The Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, and the Warren Report could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:\n\nThe proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret, and about 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.\"Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing...Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and all of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission.\" (Bugliosi, p. 332)\n\nRamsey Clark Panel\n\nIn 1968, the Ramsey Clark Panel examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence, concluding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/clark.txt 1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John E Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas]  (.txt) at Kennedy Assassination Home Page\n\nHouse Select Committee\n\nIn 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.Bugliosi, Reclaiming History, p. 376 However, late in the Committee's proceedings a dictabelt recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired. After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a \"high probability that two gunmen fired\" at Kennedy and that Kennedy \"was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.\" Although the Committee was \"unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy,\" it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0005a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] HSCA Final Report, p. 3. Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.\n\nThe acoustical evidence has since been discredited. Officer H.B.

Their conclusions were later published in the journal Science.\n\nIn a 2001 article in the journal Science & Justice, D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.Donald B.

Retrieved April 10, 2010. In 2005, Thomas's conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.Linsker R., Garwin R.L., Chernoff H., Horowitz P., Ramsey N.F., [http://jfk-records.com/ScienceAndJustice_45%284%29_207-226%282005%29.pdf \"Synchronization of the acoustic evidence in the assassination of President Kennedy\"].

Thomas challenged in a book the 2005 Science & Justice article and restated his conclusion that there were at least two gunmen.\n\nBackyard photos\n\nThe \"backyard photos\", taken by Marina Oswald probably around March 31, 1963 using a camera belonging to Oswald, show Oswald holding two Marxist newspapers—The Militant and The Worker—and a rifle, and wearing a pistol in a holster. Oswald was shown the pictures after his arrest and insisted that they were forgeries, but Marina testified in 1964 that she had taken the photographs at Oswald's request—Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 15, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0014a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]. testimony she reaffirmed repeatedly over the decades.\n*[http://www.jfk-online.com/marinashaw2.html Testimony of Marina Oswald Porter], Trial of Clay Shaw, Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, February 21, 1969.\n*United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/jfkinfo4/jfk12/marinade.htm#maraug Deposition of Marina Oswald Porter] (1977):\nQ.

CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B. Oswald's mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with \"To my daughter June\" written on it.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 146, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0079b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].\n\nThe HSCA obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of George de Mohrenschildt. The words \"Hunter of fascists—ha ha ha!\" written in block Russian were on the back. Also in English were added in script: \"To my friend George, Lee Oswald, 5/IV/63 [April 5, 1963].\"HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, p. 151, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm Figure IV-21]. Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald. After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.\n\nThese photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0072b.htm \"The Oswald Backyard Photographs\"] Photographic experts consulted by the HSCA concluded they were genuine, answering twenty-one points raised by critics. Marina Oswald has always maintained she took the photos herself, and the 1963 de Mohrenschildt print bearing Oswald's signature clearly indicate they existed before the assassination. Nonetheless, some continue to contest their authenticity.United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/jfkinfo/hscawhte.htm Testimony of Jack D. White]. In 2009, after digitally analyzing the photograph of Oswald holding the rifle and paper, computer scientist Hany Farid concluded that the photo \"almost certainly was not altered.\"\n\nOther investigations and dissenting theories\n\n \n\nSome critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed.\n\nPublic opinion\n\nA Gallup Poll taken in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed that Kennedy was killed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald acted alone.\n\nCriminal trial\n\nOswald was never prosecuted because he was murdered two days after the killings of Kennedy and Tippit. In March 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others. Garrison believed that the men were part of an arms smuggling ring supplying weapons to the anti-Castro Cubans in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA to kill Kennedy.  The trial of Clay Shaw began in January 1969 in Orleans Parish Criminal Court. The jury acquitted Shaw.\n\nFictional trials\n\nSeveral films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald, depicting what may have happened had Ruby not killed Oswald. The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964); The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977); and On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald (1986) have imagined such a trial. In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a  judge,Bugliosi, Reclaiming History with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty. In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials. The first trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.
