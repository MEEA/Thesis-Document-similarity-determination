  "textBody" : "An ansible is a category of fictional device or technology capable of instantaneous or faster-than-light communication. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay. The term ansible is broadly shared across works of several science fiction authors, settings and continuities.\n\nOrigin \n\nUrsula K. Le Guin coined the word ansible in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.Bernardo, Susan M. & Murphy, Graham J. Ursula K. Le Guin: A Critical Companion (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), page 18. The word is a contraction of \"answerable\", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over interstellar distances. Her award-winning 1974 novel The Dispossessed, a book in the Hainish Cycle, tells of the invention of the ansible.\n\nLe Guin's ansible was said to communicate \"instantaneously\", but other authors have adopted the name for devices capable only of finite-speed communication, although still faster than light.\n\nUse in fiction \n\nThe name of the device has since been borrowed by authors such as Orson Scott Card,\nVernor Vinge, Elizabeth Moon, Jason Jones,Jones, Jason (with Greg Kirkpatrick) (1995-11-24) Marathon 2: Durandal, computer game, Chicago, Illinois: Bungie Software. \"A connection [?ansible] was left; awaiting the next quiet [?peace]; and though destroyed by the threes, it will scream over the void one time.\" Kim Stanley Robinson,\"Any device that uses this phenomenon is called an ansible, and these devices have been constructed.\" (2312) L.A. Graf, and Dan Simmons. The term is used extensively by Joe M. McDermott in his work The Fortress at the End of Time.\n\nIn Le Guin's work \n\nIn The Word for World Is Forest, Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one \"must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos.\"\n\nIn The Left Hand of Darkness, the ansible \n\nAny ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited bandwidth which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.\n\nIn Card's work \n\nOrson Scott Card's Ender's Game series uses the term \"ansible\" for his own fictitious communicator, one of the characters explaining that \"...somebody dredged the name ansible out of an old book somewhere.\" Card's description of the ansible's functions in Xenocide involves a fictional subatomic particle, the philote. In the \"Enderverse\", the two quarks inside a pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by \"philotic rays\". This concept is similar to quantum teleportation due to entanglement. However, in reality, quark confinement prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance. The ansible is also featured in the video game Advent Rising, for which Card helped write the story.",
