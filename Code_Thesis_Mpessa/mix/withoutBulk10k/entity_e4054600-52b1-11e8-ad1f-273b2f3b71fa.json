The Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary lists for the Sanskrit word draviḍa a meaning of \"collective Name for 5 peoples, viz. the Āndhras, Karṇāṭakas, Gurjaras, Tailaṅgas, and Mahārāṣṭras\".[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ Sanskrit, Tamil and Pahlavi Dictionaries]\n\nClassification\n\nThe Dravidian languages form a close-knit family. Most scholars agree on four groups: South (or South DravidianI), South-Central (or South DravidianII), Central, and North Dravidian, but there are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups. Earlier classifications grouped Central and South-Central Dravidian in a single branch. Krishnamurti groups South-Central and South Dravidian. Languages recognized as official languages of India appear here in boldface.\n\nSome authors deny that North Dravidian forms a valid subgroup, splitting it into Northeast (Kurukh–Malto) and Northwest (Brahui). Their affiliation has been proposed primarily based on a small number of common phonetic developments, including:\n* In some words, *k is retracted or spirantized, shifting to in Kurukh and Brahui, in Malto.\n* In some words, *c is retracted to.\n* Word-initial *v develops to. This development is, however, also found in several other Dravidian languages, including Kannada, Kodagu and Tulu.\nMcAlpin (2003) notes that no exact conditioning can be established for the first two changes, and proposes that distinct Proto-Dravidian *q and *kʲ should be reconstructed behind these correspondences, and that Brahui, Kurukh-Malto, and the rest of Dravidian may be three coordinate branches, possibly with Brahui being the earliest language to split off. A few morphological parallels between Brahui and Kurukh-Malto are also known, but according to McAlpin they are analyzable as shared archaisms rather than shared innovations.\n\nIn addition, Ethnologue lists several unclassified Dravidian languages: Allar, Bazigar, Bharia, Malankuravan (possibly a dialect of Malayalam), and Vishavan. Ethnologue also lists several unclassified Southern Dravidian languages: Mala Malasar, Malasar, Thachanadan, Ullatan, Kalanadi, Kumbaran, Kunduvadi, Kurichiya, Attapady Kurumba, Muduga, Pathiya, and Wayanad Chetti.\n\nDistribution\n\n \nSince 1981, the Census of India has reported only languages with more than 10,000 speakers, including 17 Dravidian languages. In 1981, these accounted for approximately 24% of India's population.\nIn the 2001 census, they included 214 million people, about 21% of India's total population of 1.02 billion.\n\nTelugu is the most spoken Dravidian language, with over 74 million native speakers. The total number of speakers of Telugu, including those whose first language is not Telugu, is around 84 million people, which is around 8% of India's total population.\n\nThe smallest branch of the Dravidian languages is the Central branch, which has only around 200,000 speakers. These languages are mostly tribal, and spoken in central India.\n\nThe second-smallest branch is the Northern branch, with around 6.3 million speakers. This is the only sub-group to have a language spoken in Pakistan — Brahui.\n\nThe next-largest is the South-Central branch, which has 78 million native speakers and includes Telugu. This branch also includes the tribal language Gondi spoken in central India.\n\nThe largest group is South Dravidian, with almost 150 million speakers. Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada make up around 98% of the speakers, with Tamil being by far the most spoken language, with almost half of all South Dravidian speakers speaking it.\n\nNorthern Dravidian \n\nCentral Dravidian \n\nSouth-Central Dravidian \n\nSouth Dravidian \n\nProposed relations with other families\n\nThe Dravidian family has defied all of the attempts to show a connection with other languages, including Indo-European, Hurrian, Basque, Sumerian, Korean and Japanese. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian subcontinent (Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Nihali), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Nonetheless, although there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, Dravidian shares strong areal features with the Indo-Aryan languages, which have been attributed to a substratum influence from Dravidian.\n\nDravidian languages display typological similarities with the Uralic language group, suggesting to some a prolonged period of contact in the past. This idea is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil,Zvelebil, Kamal (2006). Dravidian Languages. In Encyclopædia Britannica (DVD edition). and Mikhail Andronov.Andronov, Mikhail S. (1971), \"Comparative Studies on the Nature of Dravidian-Uralian Parallels: A Peep into the Prehistory of Language Families\". Proceedings of the Second International Conference of Tamil Studies Madras. 267–277. This hyphothesis has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages,Zvelebil, Kamal (1970), Comparative Dravidian Phonology Mouton, The Hauge. at p. 22 contains a bibliography of articles supporting and opposing the theory and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the linguist David McAlpin produced a detailed proposal of a genetic relationship between Dravidian and the extinct Elamite language of ancient Elam (present-day southwestern Iran). The Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis was supported in the late 1980s by the archaeologist Colin Renfrew and the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who suggested that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent. p. 113. (In his 2000 book, Cavalli-Sforza suggested western India, northern India and northern Iran as alternative starting points.) However, linguists have found McAlpin's cognates unconvincing and criticized his proposed phonological rules as ad hoc. Elamite is generally believed by scholars to be a language isolate, and the theory has had no effect on studies of the language. p. 48.\n\nDravidian is one of the primary language families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the last Ice Age and the emergence of proto-Indo-European 4–6 thousand years BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier, the Dravidian languages cannot easily be connected to any other language, and they could well be indigenous to India. The Dravidian language was the most widespread indigenous language before the advance of the Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nProto-Dravidian and onset of diversification\n\nAs a proto-language, the Proto-Dravidian language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It is suggested that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.[https://books.google.com/books?idchvjAAAAMAAJ&q\nthe+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&dqthe+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&hl\nen&saX&redir_esc\ny History and Archaeology, Volume 1, Issues 1-2] p.234, Department of Ancient History, Culture, and Archaeology, University of Allahabad According to Krishnamurti, Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a \"tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium.\" Krishnamurti further states that South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including Pre-Telugu) split around the eleventh century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time.\n\nIndus Valley Civilisation\n\nThe Indus Valley civilisation (3,300-1,900 BCE), located in Northwestern Indian subcontinent, is often identified as having been Dravidian. Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers Henry Heras, Kamil Zvelebil, Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan as being strong evidence for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation. The discovery in Tamil Nadu of a late Neolithic (early 2nd millennium BCE, i.e. post-dating Harappan decline) stone celt allegedly marked with Indus signs has been considered by some to be significant for the Dravidian identification.Subramanium 2006; see also [http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery]  by I. Mahadevan (2006)\n\nYuri Knorozov surmised that the symbols represent a logosyllabic script and suggested, based on computer analysis, an underlying agglutinative Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language. Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.\n\nLinguist Asko Parpola writes that the Indus script and Harappan language are \"most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family\". Parpola led a Finnish team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the \"fish\" sign with the Dravidian word for fish, \"min\") but disagreeing on several other readings. A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book Deciphering the Indus Script.\n\nIndo-Aryan migrations and Sanskritization\n\nNorthern Dravidian pockets\n\nAlthough in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they probably were spoken in a larger area. After the Indo-Aryan migrations into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, and the establishment of the Kuru kingdom ca. 1100 BCE, a process of Sanskritisation started, which resulted in a language shift in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\nThe Kurukh and Malto are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins.P. 83 The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate by Edwin Bryant The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the Deccan Peninsula,P. 18 The Orāons of Chōtā Nāgpur: their history, economic life, and social organization. by Sarat Chandra Roy, Rai Bahadur;  Alfred C Haddon more specifically Karnataka. The same tradition has existed of the Brahui,P. 12 Origin and Spread of the Tamils By V. R. Ramachandra DikshitarP. 32 Ideology and status of Sanskrit : contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language by Jan E M Houben who call themselves immigrants.P. 45 The Brahui language, an old Dravidian language spoken in parts of Baluchistan and Sind by Sir Denys Bray Holding this same view of the Brahui are many scholars Ancient India; Culture and Thought By M. L. Bhagi such as L.H. Horace Perera and M.Ratnasabapathy.P. 23 Ceylon & Indian History from Early Times to 1505 A.D. By L. H. Horace Perera, M. Ratnasabapathy\n\nThe Brahui population of Pakistan's Balochistan province has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and arrived in the area from the west only around 1,000AD. Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.\n\nDravidian influence on Sanskrit\n\nDravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages.\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109791 Dravidian languages.]\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008 Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c.1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.\n\nVedic Sanskrit has retroflex consonants (/, ) with about 88 words in the Rigveda having unconditioned retroflexes. Some sample words are ', ', ', ', ' and '.\nSince other Indo-European languages, including other Indo-Iranian languages, lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants. The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the Proto-Dravidian stage.\n\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister Avestan language appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the gerund, which has the same function as in Dravidian, and the quotative marker iti. Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian substratum. These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is language shift, that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages. Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.\n\nGrammar\n\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:\n* Dravidian languages are agglutinative.\n* Word order is subject–object–verb (SOV).\n* Dravidian languages have a clusivity distinction.\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, negative verbs.\n\nPhonology\n\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the orthography shows distinctions in voice and aspiration, the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of phonology and phonotactics: aspiration of plosives is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, Tamil does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the Tamil alphabet lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveolar, and retroflex places of articulation as well as large numbers of liquids.\n\nProto-Dravidian\n\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: *a, *ā, *i, *ī, *u, *ū, *e, *ē, *o, *ō. There were no diphthongs; ai and au are treated as *ay and *av (or *aw).\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:\n\nNumerals\n\nThe numerals from 1 to 10 in various Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages (here exemplified by Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi).\n\n# This is the same as the word for another form of the number one in Tamil and Malayalam, used as the indefinite article (\"a\") and when the number is an attribute preceding a noun (as in \"one person\"), as opposed to when it is a noun (as in \"How many are there?\" \"One\").\n# The stem *īr is still found in compound words, and has taken on a meaning of \"double\" in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. For example, irupatu (20, literally meaning \"double-ten\"), iravai (20 in Telugu), \"iraṭṭi\" (\"double\") or iruvar (\"two people\", in Tamil) and \"ippatthu\" (ipp-hatthu) literally meaning double ten in Kannada.\n# The Kolami numbers 5 to 10 are borrowed from Telugu.\n# The word tondu was also used to refer to the number nine in ancient sangam texts but was later completely replaced by the word onpadu.\n# These forms are derived from \"one (less than) ten\". Proto-Dravidian *toḷ is still used in Tamil and Malayalam as the basis of numbers such as 90, thonnooru.\n* Words indicated (II) are borrowings from Indo-Iranian languages (in Brahui's case, from Persian).\n\nLiterature\n\nFour Dravidian languages, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu, have lengthy literary traditions.\nLiterature in Tulu and Kodava is more recent.\n\nThe earliest known Dravidian inscriptions are 76 Old inscriptions on cave walls in Madurai and Tirunelveli districts in Tamil Nadu, dating from the 2nd century BCE.\nThese inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi.\nThe earliest long text in Old Tamil is the Tolkāppiyam, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could date from the 1st century BCE.",

Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada make up around 98% of the speakers, with Tamil being by far the most spoken language, with almost half of all South Dravidian speakers speaking it.\n\nNorthern Dravidian \n\nCentral Dravidian \n\nSouth-Central Dravidian \n\nSouth Dravidian \n\nProposed relations with other families\n\nThe Dravidian family has defied all of the attempts to show a connection with other languages, including Indo-European, Hurrian, Basque, Sumerian, Korean and Japanese. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian subcontinent (Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Nihali), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Nonetheless, although there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, Dravidian shares strong areal features with the Indo-Aryan languages, which have been attributed to a substratum influence from Dravidian.\n\nDravidian languages display typological similarities with the Uralic language group, suggesting to some a prolonged period of contact in the past. This idea is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil,Zvelebil, Kamal (2006). Dravidian Languages. In Encyclopædia Britannica (DVD edition). and Mikhail Andronov.Andronov, Mikhail S. (1971), \"Comparative Studies on the Nature of Dravidian-Uralian Parallels: A Peep into the Prehistory of Language Families\". Proceedings of the Second International Conference of Tamil Studies Madras. 267–277. This hyphothesis has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages,Zvelebil, Kamal (1970), Comparative Dravidian Phonology Mouton, The Hauge. at p. 22 contains a bibliography of articles supporting and opposing the theory and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the linguist David McAlpin produced a detailed proposal of a genetic relationship between Dravidian and the extinct Elamite language of ancient Elam (present-day southwestern Iran). The Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis was supported in the late 1980s by the archaeologist Colin Renfrew and the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who suggested that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent. p. 113. (In his 2000 book, Cavalli-Sforza suggested western India, northern India and northern Iran as alternative starting points.) However, linguists have found McAlpin's cognates unconvincing and criticized his proposed phonological rules as ad hoc. Elamite is generally believed by scholars to be a language isolate, and the theory has had no effect on studies of the language. p. 48.\n\nDravidian is one of the primary language families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the last Ice Age and the emergence of proto-Indo-European 4–6 thousand years BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier, the Dravidian languages cannot easily be connected to any other language, and they could well be indigenous to India. The Dravidian language was the most widespread indigenous language before the advance of the Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nProto-Dravidian and onset of diversification\n\nAs a proto-language, the Proto-Dravidian language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It is suggested that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.[https://books.google.com/books?idchvjAAAAMAAJ&q\nthe+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&dqthe+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&hl\nen&saX&redir_esc\ny History and Archaeology, Volume 1, Issues 1-2] p.234, Department of Ancient History, Culture, and Archaeology, University of Allahabad According to Krishnamurti, Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a \"tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium.\" Krishnamurti further states that South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including Pre-Telugu) split around the eleventh century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time.\n\nIndus Valley Civilisation\n\nThe Indus Valley civilisation (3,300-1,900 BCE), located in Northwestern Indian subcontinent, is often identified as having been Dravidian. Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers Henry Heras, Kamil Zvelebil, Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan as being strong evidence for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation. The discovery in Tamil Nadu of a late Neolithic (early 2nd millennium BCE, i.e. post-dating Harappan decline) stone celt allegedly marked with Indus signs has been considered by some to be significant for the Dravidian identification.Subramanium 2006; see also [http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery]  by I. Mahadevan (2006)\n\nYuri Knorozov surmised that the symbols represent a logosyllabic script and suggested, based on computer analysis, an underlying agglutinative Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language. Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.\n\nLinguist Asko Parpola writes that the Indus script and Harappan language are \"most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family\". Parpola led a Finnish team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the \"fish\" sign with the Dravidian word for fish, \"min\") but disagreeing on several other readings. A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book Deciphering the Indus Script.\n\nIndo-Aryan migrations and Sanskritization\n\nNorthern Dravidian pockets\n\nAlthough in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they probably were spoken in a larger area. After the Indo-Aryan migrations into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, and the establishment of the Kuru kingdom ca. 1100 BCE, a process of Sanskritisation started, which resulted in a language shift in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\nThe Kurukh and Malto are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins.P. 83 The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate by Edwin Bryant The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the Deccan Peninsula,P. 18 The Orāons of Chōtā Nāgpur: their history, economic life, and social organization. by Sarat Chandra Roy, Rai Bahadur;  Alfred C Haddon more specifically Karnataka.

L. Bhagi such as L.H. Horace Perera and M.Ratnasabapathy.P. 23 Ceylon & Indian History from Early Times to 1505 A.D. By L. H. Horace Perera, M. Ratnasabapathy\n\nThe Brahui population of Pakistan's Balochistan province has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and arrived in the area from the west only around 1,000AD. Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.\n\nDravidian influence on Sanskrit\n\nDravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages.\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109791 Dravidian languages.]\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008 Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c.1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.\n\nVedic Sanskrit has retroflex consonants (/, ) with about 88 words in the Rigveda having unconditioned retroflexes. Some sample words are ', ', ', ', ' and '.\nSince other Indo-European languages, including other Indo-Iranian languages, lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants. The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the Proto-Dravidian stage.\n\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister Avestan language appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the gerund, which has the same function as in Dravidian, and the quotative marker iti. Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian substratum. These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is language shift, that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages. Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.\n\nGrammar\n\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:\n* Dravidian languages are agglutinative.\n* Word order is subject–object–verb (SOV).\n* Dravidian languages have a clusivity distinction.\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, negative verbs.\n\nPhonology\n\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the orthography shows distinctions in voice and aspiration, the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of phonology and phonotactics: aspiration of plosives is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, Tamil does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the Tamil alphabet lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveolar, and retroflex places of articulation as well as large numbers of liquids.\n\nProto-Dravidian\n\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: *a, *ā, *i, *ī, *u, *ū, *e, *ē, *o, *ō. There were no diphthongs; ai and au are treated as *ay and *av (or *aw).\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:\n\nNumerals\n\nThe numerals from 1 to 10 in various Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages (here exemplified by Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi).\n\n# This is the same as the word for another form of the number one in Tamil and Malayalam, used as the indefinite article (\"a\") and when the number is an attribute preceding a noun (as in \"one person\"), as opposed to when it is a noun (as in \"How many are there?\" \"One\").\n# The stem *īr is still found in compound words, and has taken on a meaning of \"double\" in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. For example, irupatu (20, literally meaning \"double-ten\"), iravai (20 in Telugu), \"iraṭṭi\" (\"double\") or iruvar (\"two people\", in Tamil) and \"ippatthu\" (ipp-hatthu) literally meaning double ten in Kannada.\n# The Kolami numbers 5 to 10 are borrowed from Telugu.\n# The word tondu was also used to refer to the number nine in ancient sangam texts but was later completely replaced by the word onpadu.\n# These forms are derived from \"one (less than) ten\". Proto-Dravidian *toḷ is still used in Tamil and Malayalam as the basis of numbers such as 90, thonnooru.\n* Words indicated (II) are borrowings from Indo-Iranian languages (in Brahui's case, from Persian).\n\nLiterature\n\nFour Dravidian languages, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu, have lengthy literary traditions.\nLiterature in Tulu and Kodava is more recent.\n\nThe earliest known Dravidian inscriptions are 76 Old inscriptions on cave walls in Madurai and Tirunelveli districts in Tamil Nadu, dating from the 2nd century BCE.\nThese inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi.\nThe earliest long text in Old Tamil is the Tolkāppiyam, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could date from the 1st century BCE.
