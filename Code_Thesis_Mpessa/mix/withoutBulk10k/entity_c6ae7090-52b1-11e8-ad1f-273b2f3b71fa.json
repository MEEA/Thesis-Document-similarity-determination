  "textBody" : "The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago.  It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the United States state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \"the Bahamas\" can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 180000 sqmi of ocean space.\n\nThe Bahamas is the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New World in 1492. At that time, the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.\n\nThe Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves; the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships, American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida, and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Today, Afro-Bahamians make up nearly 90% of the population.\n\nThe Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining the British monarch, then and currently Queen Elizabeth II, as its head of state. In terms of gross domestic product per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and finance.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryNameBahamas,%20The&countryCode\nbf&regionCodecam&rank\n49#bf Country Comparison :: GDP – per capita (PPP)]. CIA World Factbook.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Bahamas is mostly likely derived from either the Taíno ' (\"big upper middle land\"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous Native Americans, or possibly from the Spanish ' (\"shallow water or sea\" or \"low tide\") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from ', a local name of unclear meaning.\n\nA peculiarity of the name is that the word The is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is, therefore, capitalised. So in contrast to \"the Congo\" and \"the United Kingdom\", it is proper to write \"The Bahamas\".\n\nHistory\n\nTaino people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan people. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of Christopher Columbus' arrival in 1492.\n\nColumbus's first landfall in the New World was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as Guanahani). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day San Salvador Island (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on Samana Cay, according to calculations made in 1986 by National Geographic writer and editor Joseph Judge, based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them.\n\nThe Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity; half of the Taino died from smallpox alone.[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?sourcehttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&destination\nhttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&levelId=2100 \"Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?\"], Education Week, 9 October 1991 The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.\n\nIn 1648, the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle, migrated from Bermuda. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named Eleuthera—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled New Providence, naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers salvaged goods from wrecks.\n\nIn 1670, King Charles II granted the islands to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing governors, and administering the country. In 1684 Spanish corsair Juan de Alcon raided the capital, Charles Town (later renamed Nassau). In 1703, a joint Franco-Spanish expedition briefly occupied the Bahamian capital during the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\n18th–19th centuries\n\nDuring proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard (circa 1680–1718). To put an end to the 'Pirates' republic' and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of Woodes Rogers. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy. In 1720, Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack.\n\nDuring the American War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. US Marines occupied the capital of Nassau for a fortnight.\n\nIn 1782, following the British defeat at Yorktown, a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city surrendered without a fight. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Before the news was received, however, the islands were recaptured by a small British force led by Andrew Deveaux.\n\nAfter American independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists with their slaves in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.\n\nIn 1807, the British abolished the slave trade, followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the Royal Navy intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.\n\nIn the 1820s during the period of the Seminole Wars in Florida, hundreds of American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from Cape Florida to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest Andros Island, where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 sloops, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID\n9173&SPFTerritoryFlorida&SPFType\nSite&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], Network to Freedom, National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013Vignoles, Charles Blacker (1823) Observations on the Floridas, New York: E.

The museum has researched and documented the African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_partner_details.htm?PARTNERID13845&PARTNERTerritory\nNULL&PARTNERKeywords=Red%20Bays Partners: \"African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC)\"], Network to Freedom, National Park Service, accessed 10 April 2013\n\nIn 1818,[https://books.google.com/books?idZ70-AAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA259 Appendix: \"Brigs Encomium and Enterprise\"], Register of Debates in Congress, Gales & Seaton, 1837, pp. 251–253. Note: In trying to retrieve American slaves off the Encomium from colonial officials (who freed them), the U.S. consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that \"he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by Sir Christopher Robinson and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State\". the Home Office in London had ruled that \"any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West Indies would be manumitted.\" This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.Horne, p. 103 The American slave ships Comet and Encomium used in the United States domestic coastwise slave trade, were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the Comet and 48 on the Encomium. Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.Horne, p. 137[https://books.google.com/books?idZ70-AAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA259&lpgPA259&dq\nbrig+Comet+1830&sourcebl&ots\ny_uxAN54OM&sigl_3rV5PKNYcogWpkSE63wi4aWQ8&hl\nen&saX&ei\npclmUZ6CAcng2gWIy4CQAQ&ved0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v\nonepage&qbrig%20Comet%201830&f\nfalse Register of Debates in Congress, Gales & Seaton], 1837, The section, \"Brigs Encomium and Enterprise\", has a collection of lengthy correspondence between US (including M. Van Buren), Vail, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in London, and British agents, including Lord Palmerston, sent to the Senate on 13 February 1837, by President Andrew Jackson, as part of the continuing process of seeking compensation.\n\nSlavery was abolished in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 American slaves from the Enterprise, which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the Hermosa, which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840.Horne, pp. 107–108 The most notable case was that of the Creole in 1841: as a result of a slave revolt on board, the leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in New Orleans. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The Creole case has been described as the \"most successful slave revolt in U.S. history\".\n\nThese incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and Great Britain. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the Creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.\n\n20th century\n\nIn August 1940, the Duke of Windsor was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. He arrived in the colony with his wife, the Duchess. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they \"tried to make the best of a bad situation\".Higham, pp. 300–302 He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as \"a third-class British colony\".Bloch, Michael (1982). The Duke of Windsor's War, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. , p. 364.\n\nHe opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the \"Out Islands\" that November, on Axel Wenner-Gren's yacht, which caused controversy;Higham, pp. 307–309 the British Foreign Office strenuously objected because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring of Nazi Germany.Bloch, Michael (1982). The Duke of Windsor's War. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. , pp. 154–159, 230–233\n\nThe Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in June 1942, when there was a \"full-scale riot\".Higham, pp. 331–332 Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on \"mischief makers – communists\" and \"men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\".Ziegler, Philip (1991). King Edward VIII: The Official Biography. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. . pp. 471–472\n\nThe Duke resigned the post on 16 March 1945.Matthew, H. C. G.

The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with Sir Roland Symonette, of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier.\n\nA new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964. In 1967, Lynden Pindling of the Progressive Liberal Party, became the first native born Premier of the majority native Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to Prime Minister. In 1968, Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence. A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968.\n\nThe British House of Lords voted to give the Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973. Prince Charles delivered the official documents to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, officially declaring the Bahamas a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973. It joined the Commonwealth of Nations on the same day. Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first Governor-General of the Bahamas (the official representative of Queen Elizabeth II) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on 22 August 1973, and it joined the United Nations on 18 September 1973.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.\n\nThe University of The Bahamas (UB) is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, UB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The University of the Bahamas was chartered on November 10, 2016.\n\nGeography\n\nThe country lies between latitudes 20° and 28°N, and longitudes 72° and 80°W.\n\nIn 1864, the Governor of the Bahamas reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.Albury, Paul (1975). The Story of the Bahamas. London: MacMillan Caribbean, p. 6\n\nThe closest island to the United States is Bimini, which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of Abaco is to the east of Grand Bahama. The southeasternmost island is Inagua. The largest island is Andros Island. Other inhabited islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, Rum Cay, Long Island, San Salvador Island, Ragged Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, Berry Islands and Mayaguana. Nassau, capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of New Providence.\n\nAll the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to. The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of 63 m.\n\nTo the southeast, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and three more extensive submarine features called Mouchoir Bank, Silver Bank and Navidad Bank, are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas.\n\nCastaway Cay\n\nDisney has its own private island in the Bahamas called Castaway Cay. It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease for the cay from the Bahamian government, set to expire in 2096.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of the Bahamas is tropical savannah climate or Aw according to Köppen climate classification. The low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low elevation give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10 °C for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American mainland. There is only an 8 °C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight annually.\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.\n\nGeology\n\nThe Bahamas is part of the Lucayan Archipelago, which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Mouchoir Bank, the Silver Bank, and the Navidad Bank.\n\nThe Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the Blake Plateau, formed about 150 Ma, not long after the formation of the North Atlantic.  The 6.4 km thick limestones, which predominately make up The Bahamas, date back to the Cretaceous.  These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the North American continental crust.  Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight.  Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands.  Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the Gulf Stream.  This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the Cay Sal Bank, plus the Little and Great Bahama Banks.  Sedimentation from the \"carbonate factory\" of each bank, or atoll, continues today at the rate of about 2 cm per kyr. Coral reefs form the \"retaining walls\" of these atolls, within which oolites and pellets form.\n\nCoral growth was greater through the Tertiary, until the start of the Ice Ages, and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m.  In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level.  Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3 °C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. Cemented ooids are referred to as grapestone.  Additionally, giant stromatolites are found off the Exuma Cays.\n\nSea level changes resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form sand dunes with distinct cross-bedding.  Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly lithified through the action of rainwater, called eolianite.  Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height.  The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.\n\nSolution weathering of the limestone results in a \"Bahamian Karst\" topography.  This includes potholes, Blue holes such as Dean's Blue Hole, sinkholes, beachrock such as the Bimini Road (\"pavements of Atlantis\"), limestone crust, caves due to the lack of rivers, and sea caves.  Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros Fault line. Tidal flats and tidal creeks are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as Great Bahama Canyon with the evidence of turbidity currents and turbidite deposition.\n\nThe stratigraphy of the islands consists of the Middle Pleistocene Owl's Hole Formation, overlain by the Late Pleistocene Grotto Beach Formation, and then the Holocene Rice Bay Formation.  However, these units are not necessarily stacked on top of each other but can be located laterally.  The oldest formation, Owl's Hole, is capped by a terra rosa paleosoil, as is the Grotto Beach, unless eroded.  The Grotto Beach Formation is the most widespread.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nThe Bahamas is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy headed by Queen Elizabeth II in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the Westminster system. The Bahamas is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm, retaining the Queen as head of state (represented by a Governor-General).\n\nLegislative power is vested In a bicameral parliament, which consists of a 38-member House of Assembly (the lower house), with members elected from single-member districts, and a 16-member Senate, with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.\n\nThe Prime Minister is the head of government and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is Dame Marguerite Pindling, and the current Prime Minister is The Rt. Hon. Hubert Minnis M.P..\n\nConstitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement and association. The Judiciary of the Bahamas is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English law.\n\nPolitical culture\n\nThe Bahamas has a two-party system dominated by the centre-left Progressive Liberal Party and the centre-right Free National Movement. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the Bahamas Democratic Movement, the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the Democratic National Alliance.\n\nForeign relations\n\nThe Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the United States and the United Kingdom, represented by an ambassador in Washington and High Commissioner in London. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\n\nArmed forces\n\nIts military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the Queen, to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)'s Regional Security Task Force.\n\nThe RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThe districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except New Providence (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the \"Local Government Act\" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts.[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors & Town Committee Members].

The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colors on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.\n\nCoat of arms\n\nThe coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a marlin and a flamingo, which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.\n\nOn top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the Santa María of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:[http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms].

Garden Club.\n\nThey reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the bougainvillea, hibiscus and poinciana—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flower].

World Bank, Retrieved on 20 April 2014. It was revealed in the Panama Papers that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies.\n\nTourism\n\nThe Bahamas relies on tourism to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html \"The Bahamas – Economy\"], Encyclopedia of the Nations, Retrieved 21 March 2010. The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.\n\nFinancial services\n\nAfter tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.\n\nThe government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.\n\nThe economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, VAT, licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include onions, okra, tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, cucumbers, sugar cane, lemons, limes, and sweet potatoes.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe Bahamas has an estimated population of , of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65.

The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).\n\nThe most populous islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located; and Grand Bahama, home to the second largest city of Freeport.\n\nRacial and ethnic groups\n\nAccording to the 99% response rate obtained from the race question on the 2010 Census questionnaire, 90.6% of the population identified themselves as being Black, 4.7% White and 2.1% of a mixed race (Black and White).[http://www.soencouragement.org/forms/CENSUS2010084903300.pdf Bahamas 2010 census TOTAL POPULATION BY SEX, AGE GROUP AND RACIAL GROUP] \"In 1722 when the first official census of the Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was European or native British and 26% was African or mixed.

The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from Bermuda; they arrived with the Eleutheran Adventurers looking for new lives.\n\nThe Haitian community in the Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.Davis, Nick (20 September 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8257660.stm \"Bahamas outlook clouds for Haitians\"], BBC.\n\nThe White Bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the English Puritans looking to flee religious persecution in England and American Loyalists escaping the American Revolution who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.\"[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bhswgw/land.htm The Names of Loyalist Settlers and Grants of Land Which They Received from the British Government: 1778–1783]\". Many Southern Loyalists went to the Abaco Islands, half of whose population was of European descent as of 1985.Christmas, Rachel J. and Christmas, Walter (1984) Fielding's Bermuda and the Bahamas 1985. Fielding Travel Books. p. 158.  The term white is usually used to identify Bahamians with Anglo ancestry, as well as \"light-skinned\" Afro-Bahamians. Sometimes Bahamians use the term Conchy Joe to describe people of Anglo descent.\n\nA small portion of the Euro-Bahamian population is descended from Greek labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's population, but have still preserved their distinct Greek Bahamian culture.\n\nBahamians typically identify themselves simply as either black or white.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe official language of the Bahamas is English. Many people speak an English-based creole language called Bahamian dialect (known simply as \"dialect\") or  \"Bahamianese.\"  Laurente Gibbs, a Bahamian writer and actor was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage. Both are used as autoglossonyms. Haitian Creole, a French-based creole language is spoken by Haitians and their descendants, who make up of about 25% of the total population. It is known simply as Creole to differentiate languages. Also note that the Bahamas was once under British rule and therefore the English taught in the Bahamian schools is still \"British-based\".\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' population is predominantly Christian. Protestant denominations are widespread and collectively account for more than 70% of the population, with Baptists representing 35% of the population, Anglicans 15%, Pentecostals 8%, Church of God 5%, Seventh-day Adventists 5% and Methodists 4%. There is also a significant Roman Catholic community accounting for about 14%.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

There are also smaller communities of Jews, Muslims, Baha'is, Hindus, Rastafarians and practitioners of Obeah.\n\nCulture\n\nIn the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called \"straw\", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called \"Voodoo dolls\", even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.Hurbon, Laennec (1995). \"American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.\" Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 181–97.\n\nA form of folk magic (obeah) is practiced by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas. The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615023254/http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/statutes/statute_CHAPTER_84.html#Ch84s232#Ch84s232 \"Practising Obeah, etc.\"], Ch. 84 Penal Code. laws.bahamas.gov.bs\n\nJunkanoo is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.\n\nRegattas are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned work boats, as well as an onshore festival.\n\nMany dishes are associated with Bahamian cuisine, which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the \"Pineapple Fest\" in Gregory Town, Eleuthera or the \"Crab Fest\" on Andros. Other significant traditions include story telling.\n\nBahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders.Collinwood, Dean W. and Dodge, Steve (1989) Modern Bahamian Society, Caribbean Books, .\n\nBahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.\n\nSport\n\nSport is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is cricket. Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846.[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/Recreation%20and%20Sports/Cricket/!ut/p/b1/vZLbcqowGEafpQ9gCWe4BMEQkVM454ZRQARFaEVQnn7bvW86nWl7s9vkKjMr_8r3TShCJRQ5b8e62g51d96e3s5EyFgALUXhJAvyQAAodDeKKxqMwwtUTCVGyty0zqogwvtDGmNlle4gvgSOGNk7tShgh_d9CjJVb_fj4gBkmT3l57mqJD0El7VotoIrDzQXoOV62ec0agM27tQ887OgbDDbCHdtLk4WvIVFq1SCk8p6d09czrFKW4ZEnMXzwnc7GN_L2ai9nOzYQ0TMaa5u261a87u2a9dkaa0by_cP5H7u8kXUZ5uzJL1oF_YRMn2EBJ8sBXzXwb_7nwEc-L5D8iXyNuEv8NUTv5zgMVT6AMR3QBABgGigYJ_2AGcwVEAlgMv85t6j-TjjZsbmsMFWoNMmmCMraJLIDvTZGiLb1rwJ6LTtzylz0Txg7TDyh41bRDhUFa3WAK1-FDpMID-ES1owQx74Dv3TQsg70qMCMXAVngHQBL8t_N1KoeuwP57ww6f5_8I1Repd-zzl7TN4ZnmJE2VZ4BiJEQRapKIm5HjtgibdvZmwL45J4Rx8W518pNe9Dp3Rr-Lx6l3yfSUHL8tjt-6bIbA0LbqJ3avanl0Yhi9HMQb9CMnikntug5LX1VVFR0GNvbw8Fp1vd6sZYRtN-2AYdvJeJ_StbSZpuro4FV2GnE7SiK90bFc0IXzpbUmIVeZ1WDqrOK-4xZyE4WBklphp-ZAGpW60bmnXOTpmBoE-o9UWcoBC1Cx8Ea_cviX3ELCgmzhWnNVRATUCT5RtdG1J9e1obgRszMm7XSpPfwAK0BGQ/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/ Cricket – Government – Non-Residents].

    "aggregatedText" : "The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago.  It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the United States state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \"the Bahamas\" can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 180000 sqmi of ocean space.\n\nThe Bahamas is the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New World in 1492. At that time, the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.\n\nThe Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves; the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships, American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida, and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Today, Afro-Bahamians make up nearly 90% of the population.\n\nThe Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining the British monarch, then and currently Queen Elizabeth II, as its head of state. In terms of gross domestic product per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and finance.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryNameBahamas,%20The&countryCode\nbf&regionCodecam&rank\n49#bf Country Comparison :: GDP – per capita (PPP)]. CIA World Factbook.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Bahamas is mostly likely derived from either the Taíno ' (\"big upper middle land\"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous Native Americans, or possibly from the Spanish ' (\"shallow water or sea\" or \"low tide\") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from ', a local name of unclear meaning.\n\nA peculiarity of the name is that the word The is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is, therefore, capitalised. So in contrast to \"the Congo\" and \"the United Kingdom\", it is proper to write \"The Bahamas\".\n\nHistory\n\nTaino people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan people. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of Christopher Columbus' arrival in 1492.\n\nColumbus's first landfall in the New World was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as Guanahani). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day San Salvador Island (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on Samana Cay, according to calculations made in 1986 by National Geographic writer and editor Joseph Judge, based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them.\n\nThe Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity; half of the Taino died from smallpox alone.[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?sourcehttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&destination\nhttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&levelId=2100 \"Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?\"], Education Week, 9 October 1991 The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.\n\nIn 1648, the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle, migrated from Bermuda. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named Eleuthera—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled New Providence, naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers salvaged goods from wrecks.\n\nIn 1670, King Charles II granted the islands to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing governors, and administering the country. In 1684 Spanish corsair Juan de Alcon raided the capital, Charles Town (later renamed Nassau). In 1703, a joint Franco-Spanish expedition briefly occupied the Bahamian capital during the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\n18th–19th centuries\n\nDuring proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard (circa 1680–1718). To put an end to the 'Pirates' republic' and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of Woodes Rogers. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy. In 1720, Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack.\n\nDuring the American War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. US Marines occupied the capital of Nassau for a fortnight.\n\nIn 1782, following the British defeat at Yorktown, a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city surrendered without a fight. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Before the news was received, however, the islands were recaptured by a small British force led by Andrew Deveaux.\n\nAfter American independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists with their slaves in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.\n\nIn 1807, the British abolished the slave trade, followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the Royal Navy intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.\n\nIn the 1820s during the period of the Seminole Wars in Florida, hundreds of American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from Cape Florida to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest Andros Island, where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 sloops, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID\n9173&SPFTerritoryFlorida&SPFType\nSite&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], Network to Freedom, National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013Vignoles, Charles Blacker (1823) Observations on the Floridas, New York: E.

Note: In trying to retrieve American slaves off the Encomium from colonial officials (who freed them), the U.S. consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that \"he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by Sir Christopher Robinson and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State\". the Home Office in London had ruled that \"any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West Indies would be manumitted.\" This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.Horne, p. 103 The American slave ships Comet and Encomium used in the United States domestic coastwise slave trade, were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the Comet and 48 on the Encomium. Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.Horne, p. 137[https://books.google.com/books?idZ70-AAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA259&lpgPA259&dq\nbrig+Comet+1830&sourcebl&ots\ny_uxAN54OM&sigl_3rV5PKNYcogWpkSE63wi4aWQ8&hl\nen&saX&ei\npclmUZ6CAcng2gWIy4CQAQ&ved0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v\nonepage&qbrig%20Comet%201830&f\nfalse Register of Debates in Congress, Gales & Seaton], 1837, The section, \"Brigs Encomium and Enterprise\", has a collection of lengthy correspondence between US (including M. Van Buren), Vail, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in London, and British agents, including Lord Palmerston, sent to the Senate on 13 February 1837, by President Andrew Jackson, as part of the continuing process of seeking compensation.\n\nSlavery was abolished in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 American slaves from the Enterprise, which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the Hermosa, which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840.Horne, pp. 107–108 The most notable case was that of the Creole in 1841: as a result of a slave revolt on board, the leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in New Orleans. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The Creole case has been described as the \"most successful slave revolt in U.S. history\".\n\nThese incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and Great Britain. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the Creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.\n\n20th century\n\nIn August 1940, the Duke of Windsor was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. He arrived in the colony with his wife, the Duchess. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they \"tried to make the best of a bad situation\".Higham, pp. 300–302 He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as \"a third-class British colony\".Bloch, Michael (1982). The Duke of Windsor's War, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. , p. 364.\n\nHe opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the \"Out Islands\" that November, on Axel Wenner-Gren's yacht, which caused controversy;Higham, pp. 307–309 the British Foreign Office strenuously objected because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring of Nazi Germany.Bloch, Michael (1982). The Duke of Windsor's War. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. , pp. 154–159, 230–233\n\nThe Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in June 1942, when there was a \"full-scale riot\".Higham, pp. 331–332 Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on \"mischief makers – communists\" and \"men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\".Ziegler, Philip (1991).

The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with Sir Roland Symonette, of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier.\n\nA new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964. In 1967, Lynden Pindling of the Progressive Liberal Party, became the first native born Premier of the majority native Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to Prime Minister. In 1968, Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence. A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968.\n\nThe British House of Lords voted to give the Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973. Prince Charles delivered the official documents to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, officially declaring the Bahamas a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973. It joined the Commonwealth of Nations on the same day. Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first Governor-General of the Bahamas (the official representative of Queen Elizabeth II) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on 22 August 1973, and it joined the United Nations on 18 September 1973.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.\n\nThe University of The Bahamas (UB) is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, UB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The University of the Bahamas was chartered on November 10, 2016.\n\nGeography\n\nThe country lies between latitudes 20° and 28°N, and longitudes 72° and 80°W.\n\nIn 1864, the Governor of the Bahamas reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.Albury, Paul (1975). The Story of the Bahamas. London: MacMillan Caribbean, p. 6\n\nThe closest island to the United States is Bimini, which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of Abaco is to the east of Grand Bahama. The southeasternmost island is Inagua. The largest island is Andros Island. Other inhabited islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, Rum Cay, Long Island, San Salvador Island, Ragged Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, Berry Islands and Mayaguana. Nassau, capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of New Providence.\n\nAll the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to. The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of 63 m.\n\nTo the southeast, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and three more extensive submarine features called Mouchoir Bank, Silver Bank and Navidad Bank, are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas.\n\nCastaway Cay\n\nDisney has its own private island in the Bahamas called Castaway Cay. It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease for the cay from the Bahamian government, set to expire in 2096.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of the Bahamas is tropical savannah climate or Aw according to Köppen climate classification. The low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low elevation give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10 °C for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American mainland. There is only an 8 °C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight annually.\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.\n\nGeology\n\nThe Bahamas is part of the Lucayan Archipelago, which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Mouchoir Bank, the Silver Bank, and the Navidad Bank.\n\nThe Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the Blake Plateau, formed about 150 Ma, not long after the formation of the North Atlantic.  The 6.4 km thick limestones, which predominately make up The Bahamas, date back to the Cretaceous.  These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the North American continental crust.  Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight.  Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands.  Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the Gulf Stream.  This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the Cay Sal Bank, plus the Little and Great Bahama Banks.  Sedimentation from the \"carbonate factory\" of each bank, or atoll, continues today at the rate of about 2 cm per kyr. Coral reefs form the \"retaining walls\" of these atolls, within which oolites and pellets form.\n\nCoral growth was greater through the Tertiary, until the start of the Ice Ages, and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m.  In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level.  Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3 °C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. Cemented ooids are referred to as grapestone.  Additionally, giant stromatolites are found off the Exuma Cays.\n\nSea level changes resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form sand dunes with distinct cross-bedding.  Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly lithified through the action of rainwater, called eolianite.  Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height.  The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.\n\nSolution weathering of the limestone results in a \"Bahamian Karst\" topography.  This includes potholes, Blue holes such as Dean's Blue Hole, sinkholes, beachrock such as the Bimini Road (\"pavements of Atlantis\"), limestone crust, caves due to the lack of rivers, and sea caves.  Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros Fault line. Tidal flats and tidal creeks are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as Great Bahama Canyon with the evidence of turbidity currents and turbidite deposition.\n\nThe stratigraphy of the islands consists of the Middle Pleistocene Owl's Hole Formation, overlain by the Late Pleistocene Grotto Beach Formation, and then the Holocene Rice Bay Formation.  However, these units are not necessarily stacked on top of each other but can be located laterally.  The oldest formation, Owl's Hole, is capped by a terra rosa paleosoil, as is the Grotto Beach, unless eroded.  The Grotto Beach Formation is the most widespread.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nThe Bahamas is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy headed by Queen Elizabeth II in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the Westminster system. The Bahamas is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm, retaining the Queen as head of state (represented by a Governor-General).\n\nLegislative power is vested In a bicameral parliament, which consists of a 38-member House of Assembly (the lower house), with members elected from single-member districts, and a 16-member Senate, with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.\n\nThe Prime Minister is the head of government and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is Dame Marguerite Pindling, and the current Prime Minister is The Rt. Hon. Hubert Minnis M.P..\n\nConstitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement and association. The Judiciary of the Bahamas is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English law.\n\nPolitical culture\n\nThe Bahamas has a two-party system dominated by the centre-left Progressive Liberal Party and the centre-right Free National Movement. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the Bahamas Democratic Movement, the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the Democratic National Alliance.\n\nForeign relations\n\nThe Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the United States and the United Kingdom, represented by an ambassador in Washington and High Commissioner in London. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\n\nArmed forces\n\nIts military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the Queen, to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)'s Regional Security Task Force.\n\nThe RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThe districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except New Providence (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the \"Local Government Act\" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts.[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors & Town Committee Members].

The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colors on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.\n\nCoat of arms\n\nThe coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a marlin and a flamingo, which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.\n\nOn top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the Santa María of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:[http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms].

Garden Club.\n\nThey reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the bougainvillea, hibiscus and poinciana—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flower].

World Bank, Retrieved on 20 April 2014. It was revealed in the Panama Papers that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies.\n\nTourism\n\nThe Bahamas relies on tourism to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html \"The Bahamas – Economy\"], Encyclopedia of the Nations, Retrieved 21 March 2010. The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.\n\nFinancial services\n\nAfter tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.\n\nThe government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.\n\nThe economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, VAT, licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include onions, okra, tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, cucumbers, sugar cane, lemons, limes, and sweet potatoes.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe Bahamas has an estimated population of , of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate of −2.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html#top Country Comparison \"Total fertility rate\"], CIA World Factbook.

Many people speak an English-based creole language called Bahamian dialect (known simply as \"dialect\") or  \"Bahamianese.\"  Laurente Gibbs, a Bahamian writer and actor was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage. Both are used as autoglossonyms. Haitian Creole, a French-based creole language is spoken by Haitians and their descendants, who make up of about 25% of the total population. It is known simply as Creole to differentiate languages. Also note that the Bahamas was once under British rule and therefore the English taught in the Bahamian schools is still \"British-based\".\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' population is predominantly Christian. Protestant denominations are widespread and collectively account for more than 70% of the population, with Baptists representing 35% of the population, Anglicans 15%, Pentecostals 8%, Church of God 5%, Seventh-day Adventists 5% and Methodists 4%. There is also a significant Roman Catholic community accounting for about 14%.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. [http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108512.htm Bahamas: International Religious Freedom Report 2008].  There are also smaller communities of Jews, Muslims, Baha'is, Hindus, Rastafarians and practitioners of Obeah.\n\nCulture\n\nIn the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called \"straw\", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called \"Voodoo dolls\", even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.Hurbon, Laennec (1995). \"American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.\" Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 181–97.\n\nA form of folk magic (obeah) is practiced by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas. The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615023254/http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/statutes/statute_CHAPTER_84.html#Ch84s232#Ch84s232 \"Practising Obeah, etc.\"], Ch. 84 Penal Code. laws.bahamas.gov.bs\n\nJunkanoo is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.\n\nRegattas are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned work boats, as well as an onshore festival.\n\nMany dishes are associated with Bahamian cuisine, which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the \"Pineapple Fest\" in Gregory Town, Eleuthera or the \"Crab Fest\" on Andros. Other significant traditions include story telling.\n\nBahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders.Collinwood, Dean W. and Dodge, Steve (1989) Modern Bahamian Society, Caribbean Books, .\n\nBahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.\n\nSport\n\nSport is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is cricket. Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846.[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/Recreation%20and%20Sports/Cricket/!ut/p/b1/vZLbcqowGEafpQ9gCWe4BMEQkVM454ZRQARFaEVQnn7bvW86nWl7s9vkKjMr_8r3TShCJRQ5b8e62g51d96e3s5EyFgALUXhJAvyQAAodDeKKxqMwwtUTCVGyty0zqogwvtDGmNlle4gvgSOGNk7tShgh_d9CjJVb_fj4gBkmT3l57mqJD0El7VotoIrDzQXoOV62ec0agM27tQ887OgbDDbCHdtLk4WvIVFq1SCk8p6d09czrFKW4ZEnMXzwnc7GN_L2ai9nOzYQ0TMaa5u261a87u2a9dkaa0by_cP5H7u8kXUZ5uzJL1oF_YRMn2EBJ8sBXzXwb_7nwEc-L5D8iXyNuEv8NUTv5zgMVT6AMR3QBABgGigYJ_2AGcwVEAlgMv85t6j-TjjZsbmsMFWoNMmmCMraJLIDvTZGiLb1rwJ6LTtzylz0Txg7TDyh41bRDhUFa3WAK1-FDpMID-ES1owQx74Dv3TQsg70qMCMXAVngHQBL8t_N1KoeuwP57ww6f5_8I1Repd-zzl7TN4ZnmJE2VZ4BiJEQRapKIm5HjtgibdvZmwL45J4Rx8W518pNe9Dp3Rr-Lx6l3yfSUHL8tjt-6bIbA0LbqJ3avanl0Yhi9HMQb9CMnikntug5LX1VVFR0GNvbw8Fp1vd6sZYRtN-2AYdvJeJ_StbSZpuro4FV2GnE7SiK90bFc0IXzpbUmIVeZ1WDqrOK-4xZyE4WBklphp-ZAGpW60bmnXOTpmBoE-o9UWcoBC1Cx8Ea_cviX3ELCgmzhWnNVRATUCT5RtdG1J9e1obgRszMm7XSpPfwAK0BGQ/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/ Cricket – Government – Non-Residents].

From the 1940s to the 1970s, cricket was played amongst many Bahamians. Bahamas is not a part of the West Indies Cricket Board, so players are not eligible to play for the West Indies cricket team. The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the United Kingdom with a passion for cricket were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States.
