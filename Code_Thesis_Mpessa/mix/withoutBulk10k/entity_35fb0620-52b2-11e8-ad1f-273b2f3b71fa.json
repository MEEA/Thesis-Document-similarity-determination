  "textBody" : "Modus ponens, a short form of  modus ponendo ponens (Latin for \"the way that affirms by affirming\"; generally abbreviated to MP or modus ponens)  is a rule of inference in propositional logic.Enderton 2001:110  It is also called implication elimination as this inference rule can be used to replace the condition by the consequence in the arguments. It can be summarized as \"(1) (P implies Q) and (2) (P) are asserted to be true, and therefore Q must be true.\" The history of modus ponens goes back to antiquity.Susanne Bobzien (2002). The Development of Modus Ponens in Antiquity, Phronesis 47, No. 4, 2002.\n\nModus ponens is closely related to another valid form of argument, modus tollens. Both have apparently similar but invalid forms such as affirming the consequent,  denying the antecedent, and evidence of absence. Constructive dilemma is the disjunctive version of modus ponens. Hypothetical syllogism is closely related to modus ponens and sometimes thought of as \"double modus ponens.\"\n\nFormal notation \n\nThe modus ponens rule is written as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:\n\n((P \\to Q) \\land P) \\to Q\n\nwhere P, and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system.\n\nOr in sequent notation:\nP \\to Q,\\; P\\;\\; \\vdash\\;\\; Q\n\nwhere ⊢ is a metalogical symbol meaning that Q is a syntactic consequence of P → Q and P in some logical system.\n\nExplanation \n\nThe argument form has two premises (hypothesis). The first premise is the \"if–then\" or conditional claim, namely that P implies Q. The second premise is that P, the antecedent of the conditional claim, is true. From these two premises it can be logically concluded that Q, the consequent of the conditional claim, must be true as well. In artificial intelligence, modus ponens is often called forward chaining.\n\nAn example of an argument that fits the form modus ponens:\n\nIf today is Tuesday, then John will go to work.\nToday is Tuesday.\nTherefore, John will go to work.\n\nThis argument is valid, but this has no bearing on whether any of the statements in the argument are true; for modus ponens to be a sound argument, the premises must be true for any true instances of the conclusion. An argument can be valid but nonetheless unsound if one or more premises are false; if an argument is valid and all the premises are true, then the argument is sound. For example, John might be going to work on Wednesday. In this case, the reasoning for John's going to work (because it is Wednesday) is unsound. The argument is not only sound on Tuesdays (when John goes to work), but valid on every day of the week. A propositional argument using modus ponens is said to be deductive.\n\nIn single-conclusion sequent calculi, modus ponens is the Cut rule. The cut-elimination theorem for a calculus says that every proof involving Cut can be transformed (generally, by a constructive method) into a proof without Cut, and hence that Cut is admissible.\n\nThe Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs relates modus ponens to function application:  if f is a function of type P → Q and x is of type P, then f x is of type Q.\n\nJustification via truth table\n\nThe validity of modus ponens in classical two-valued logic can be clearly demonstrated by use of a truth table.\n\nIn instances of modus ponens we assume as premises that p → q is true and p is true. Only one line of the truth table—the first—satisfies these two conditions (p  and p → q). On this line, q is also true. Therefore, whenever p → q is true and p is true, q must also be true.\n\nStatus \n\nWhile modus ponens is one of the most commonly used argument forms in logic it must not be mistaken for a logical law; rather, it is one of the accepted mechanisms for the construction of deductive proofs that includes the \"rule of definition\" and the \"rule of substitution\".Alfred Tarski 1946:47. Also Enderton 2001:110ff. Modus ponens allows one to eliminate a conditional statement from a logical proof or argument (the antecedents) and thereby not carry these antecedents forward in an ever-lengthening string of symbols; for this reason modus ponens is sometimes called the rule of detachmentTarski 1946:47 or the law of detachment.https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Modus_ponens Enderton, for example, observes that \"modus ponens can produce shorter formulas from longer ones\",Enderton 2001:111 and Russell observes that \"the process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of ⊦q [the consequent] . . . an inference is the dropping of a true premise; it is the dissolution of an implication\".Whitehead and Russell 1927:9\n\nA justification for the \"trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions [the antecedents] are not in error, the final assertion [the consequent] is not in error\".Whitehead and Russell 1927:9 In other words: if one statement or proposition implies a second one, and the first statement or proposition is true, then the second one is also true. If P implies Q and  P is true, then Q is true.\n\nCorrespondence to other mathematical frameworks\n\nProbability calculus\n\nModus ponens represents an instance of the Law of total probability which for a binary variable is expressed as:\n\n\\Pr(Q)=\\Pr(Q\\mid P)\\Pr(P)+\\Pr(Q\\mid \\lnot P)\\Pr(\\lnot P)\\,,\n\nwhere e.g. \\Pr(Q) denotes the probability of Q and the conditional probability \\Pr(Q\\mid P) generalizes the logical implication P \\to Q. Assume that \\Pr(Q) 1 is equivalent to Q being TRUE, and that \\Pr(Q) \n 0 is equivalent to Q being FALSE.  It is then easy to see that \\Pr(Q) 1 when \\Pr(Q\\mid P) \n 1 and \\Pr(P) = 1. Hence, the law of total probability represents a generalization of modus ponens Audun Jøsang 2016:2.\n\nSubjective logic\n\nModus ponens represents an instance of the binomial deduction operator in subjective logic expressed as:\n\n\\omega^{A}_{Q\\|P}= (\\omega^{A}_{Q|P},\\omega^{A}_{Q|\\lnot P})\\circledcirc \\omega^{A}_{P}\\,,\n\nwhere \\omega^{A}_{P} denotes the subjective opinion about P as expressed by source A, and the conditional opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q|P} generalizes the logical implication P \\to Q. The deduced marginal opinion about Q is denoted by \\omega^{A}_{Q\\|P}. The case where \\omega^{A}_{P} is an absolute TRUE opinion about P is equivalent to source A saying that P is TRUE, and the case where \\omega^{A}_{P} is an absolute FALSE opinion about P is equivalent to source A saying that P is FALSE.  The deduction operator \\circledcirc of subjective logic produces an absolute TRUE deduced opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q\\|P} when the conditional opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q|P} is absolute TRUE and the antecedent opinion \\omega^{A}_{P} is absolute TRUE. Hence, subjective logic deduction represents a generalization of both modus ponens and the Law of total probability Audun Jøsang 2016:92.\n\nPossible fallacies\n\nThe fallacy of affirming the consequent is a common misinterpretation of the modus ponens.",
