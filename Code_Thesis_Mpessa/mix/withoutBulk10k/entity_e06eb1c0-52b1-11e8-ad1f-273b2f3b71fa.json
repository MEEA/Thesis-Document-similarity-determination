Doctrinal statements may include positions on lectionary and translations of the Bible, particularly in fundamentalist churches of the King James Only movement.\n\nThe term creed is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of ʿaqīdah (literally \"bond, tie\") is often rendered as \"creed\".\n\nChristian creeds\n\nSeveral creeds have originated in Christianity.\n* 1 Corinthians 15, 3–7 includes an early creed about Jesus' death and resurrection which was probably received by Paul. The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.see Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus—God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed.

It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.\n* The Athanasian Creed (Quicumque vult) is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.\n* The Tridentine Creed was initially contained in the papal bull Iniunctum Nobis, issued by Pope Pius IV on November 13, 1565.  The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the Council of Trent (1545–1563).\n* The Maasai Creed is a creed composed in  1960 by the Maasai people of East Africa in collaboration with  missionaries  from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Maasai culture.\n* The Credo of the People of God is a profession of faith that Pope Paul VI published with the motu proprio Solemni hac liturgia of 30 June 1968.

This stance is often referred to as \"non-creedalism\". The Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers, consider that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. The Church of the Brethren and other Schwarzenau Brethren churches also espouses no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their \"rule of faith and practice.\"Martin, Harold S.: [http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=88 \"Forward\"], \"Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren\".
