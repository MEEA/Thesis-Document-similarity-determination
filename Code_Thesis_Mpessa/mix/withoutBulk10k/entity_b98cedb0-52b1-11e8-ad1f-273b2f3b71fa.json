For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into \"naga ram\".\n\nThe original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.

Wheatley pg. 72, printed 1862 T. & W. Boone, New Bond Street, London\nThey were popular throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, for example with the poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut.[http://www.hoasm.org/IID/Machaut.html Guillaume de Machaut], \"Here of a Sunday Morning\", WBAI They are said to go back at least to the Greek poet Lycophron, in the third century BCE; but this relies on an account of Lycophron given by John Tzetzes in the 12th century.[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lycophron The LoveToKnow Free Online Encyclopedia] \n\nAnagrams in Latin were considered witty over many centuries. \"Est vir qui adest\", explained below, was cited as the example in Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language.\n\nAny historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of George Puttenham's Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed in The Art of English Poesie (1589).\n\nInfluence of Latin\n\nAs a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent: two examples are the change of \"Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum\" (Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you) into \"Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata\" (Serene virgin, pious, clean and spotless), and the anagrammatic answer to Pilate's question, \"Quid est veritas?\" (What is truth?), namely, \"Est vir qui adest\" (It is the man who is here). The origins of these are not documented.\n\nLatin continued to influence letter values (such as I J, U \n V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be \"perfect\" if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the Jesuits: \"Societas Jesu\" turned into \"Vitiosa seces\", or \"Cut off the wicked things\". Puttenham, in the time of Elizabeth I of England, wished to start from Elissabet Anglorum Regina (Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain Multa regnabis ense gloria (By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is \"a note of aspiration only and no letter\", and that Z in Greek or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. William Camden in his Remains commented, singling out some letters—Æ, K, W, and Z—not found in the classical Roman alphabet:Cited in Henry Benjamin Wheatley, Of anagrams: a monograph treating of their history (1862); [https://archive.org/details/ofanagramsmonogr00wheauoft online text.]\n\nEarly modern period\n\nWhen it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in English or other languages, there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest. The lawyer Thomas Egerton was praised through the anagram gestat honorem ('he carries honor'); the physician George Ent took the anagrammatic motto genio surget ('he rises through spirit/genius'), which requires his first name as Georgius.Articles from the Dictionary of National Biography. James I's courtiers discovered in \"James Stuart\" \"a just master\", and converted \"Charles James Stuart\" into \"Claims Arthur's seat\" (even at that point in time, the letters I and J were more-or-less interchangeable). Walter Quin, tutor to the future Charles I, worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father James.Dictionary of National Biography. A notorious murder scandal, the Overbury case, threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by Simonds D'Ewes: \"Francis Howard\" (for Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset, her maiden name spelled in a variant) became \"Car findes a whore\", with the letters E hardly counted, and the victim Thomas Overbury, as \"Thomas Overburie\", was written as \"O! O! a busie murther\" (an old form of \"murder\"), with a V counted as U.[http://www.earlystuartlibels.net/htdocs/overbury_murder_section/H21.html Early Stuart Libels][http://www.earlystuartlibels.net/htdocs/overbury_murder_section/H22.html Early Stuart Libels]\n\nWilliam Drummond of Hawthornden, in an essay On the Character of a Perfect Anagram, tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions (such as S standing for Z) and letter omissions.Henry Benjamin Wheatley, On Anagrams (1862), p. 58. William CamdenRemains, 7th ed., 1674. provided a definition of \"Anagrammatisme\" as \"a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sense applyable (i.e., applicable) to the person named.\" Dryden in MacFlecknoe disdainfully called the pastime the \"torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways\".\n\nThy genius calls thee not to purchase fame\nIn keen iambics, but mild anagram:\nLeave writing plays, and choose for thy command\nSome peaceful province in acrostic land.\nThere thou may'st wings display and altars raise,\nAnd torture one poor word ten thousand ways.\n\n\"Eleanor Audeley\", wife of Sir John Davies, is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to \"Reveale, O Daniel\", and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by Sir John Lambe, the dean of the Arches, \"Dame Eleanor Davies\", \"Never soe mad a ladie\".Oxford Book of Word GamesHugh Trevor-Roper, Archbishop Laud (2000), p. 146.\n\nAn example from France was a flattering anagram for Cardinal Richelieu, comparing him to Hercules or at least one of his hands (Hercules being a kingly symbol), where Armand de Richelieu became Ardue main d'Hercule (\"difficult hand of Hercules\").H. W. van Helsdingen, Notes on Two Sheets of Sketches by Nicolas Poussin for the Long Gallery of the Louvre, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 5, No. 3/4 (1971), pp. 172–184.\n\nModern period\n\nExamples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of \"Horatio Nelson\" into \"Honor est a Nilo\" (Latin = 'Honor is from the Nile'); and of \"Florence Nightingale\" into \"Flit on, cheering angel\".1911 Britannica article \"anagram\". The Victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by Augustus De MorganIn his A Budget of Paradoxes, p. 82. using his own name as example; \"Great Gun, do us a sum!\" is attributed to his son William De Morgan, but a family friend John Thomas Graves was prolific, and a manuscript with over 2,800 has been preserved.Robert Edoward Moritz, On Mathematics and Mathematicians (2007), p. 151.Anna Stirling, William De Morgan and His Wife (1922) p. 64.[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/13/3491.htm AIM25 home page]\n\nWith the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement, anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the Baroque period. The German poet Unica Zürn, who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a \"dangerous fever\", because it created isolation of the author.Friederike Ursula Eigler, Susanne Kord, The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature (1997), pp. 14–5. The surrealist leader André Breton coined the anagram Avida Dollars for Salvador Dalí, to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism.\n\nApplications\n\nWhile anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called \"anagram solution tasks\", to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike.Java, Rosalind I. \"Priming and Aging: Evidence of Preserved Memory Function in an Anagram Solution Task.\" The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 105, No. 4. (Winter, 1992), pp. 541–548.\n\nEstablishment of priority\n\nNatural philosophers (astronomers and others) of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into Latin anagrams, to establish their priority. In this way they laid claim to new discoveries, before their results were ready for publication.\n\nGalileo used smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras for Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\") for discovering the rings of Saturn in 1610.\n Galileo announced his discovery that Venus had phases like the Moon in the form \"Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur oy\" (Latin: These immature ones have already been read in vain by me -oy), that is, when rearranged, \"Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum\" (Latin: The Mother of Loves [Venus] imitates the figures of Cynthia [\n the moon]). In both cases, Johannes Kepler had solved the anagrams incorrectly, assuming they were talking about the Moons of Mars and a red spot on Jupiter, respectively.[http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/62652246148/galileo-kepler-two-anagrams-two-wrong Galileo, Kepler, & Two Anagrams: Two Wrong Solutions Turn Into Two Correct Solutions] By coincidence, he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing.\n\nIn 1656, Christiaan Huygens, using a telescope superior to those available to Galileo, figured that Galileo's earlier observations of Saturn actually meant it had a ring (Galileo's tools were only sufficient to see it as bumps) and, like Galileo, had published an anagram saying \"aaaaaaacccccdeeeeeghiiiiiiillllmmnnnnnnnnnooooppqrrstttttuuuuu\". Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean \"Annuto cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato\"; that is, \"It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic\".\n\nWhen Robert Hooke discovered Hooke's law in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, ceiiinosssttuv, for ut tensio, sic vis (Latin: as the tension, so the force).Derek Gjertsen, The Newton Handbook (1986), p. 16.\n\nIn a related use, from 1975, British naturalist Sir Peter Scott coined the scientific term \"Nessiteras rhombopteryx\" (Greek for \"The monster (or wonder) of Ness with the diamond-shaped fin\") for the apocryphal Loch Ness Monster.Sir Peter Scott, Robert Rines: \"Naming the Loch Ness monster\", Nature 258, 11 December 1975, 466–468,  Shortly afterwards, several London newspapers pointed out that \"Nessiteras rhombopteryx\" anagrams into \"Monster hoax by Sir Peter S\". However, Robert Rines, who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster, countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into \"Yes, both pix are monsters, R.\"Article, \"Monster Hoax?\", in New Scientist, Christmas Double Issue, Volume 68, Number 980, page 739 (18–25 December 1975).\n\nPseudonyms\n\nAnagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity. For example, Jim Morrison used an anagram of his name in The Doors song L.A. Woman, calling himself \"Mr. Mojo Risin' \". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when Edward Cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the House of Commons.[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html Institute of Historical Research (IHR) home page] In a genre such as farce or parody, anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.\n\nPseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus \"Calvinus\" becomes \"Alcuinus\" (here V U) or \"François Rabelais\" \n \"Alcofribas Nasier\". The name \"Voltaire\" of François Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of \"Arouet, l[e] j[eune]\" (U V, J \n I) that is, \"Arouet the younger\". Other examples include\n* \"Arrigo Boito\" = \"Tobia Gorrio\"\n* \"Edward Gorey\" \"Ogdred Weary\", \n \"Regera Dowdy\" or = \"E. G. Deadworry\" (and others)\n* \"Vladimir Nabokov\" \"Vivian Darkbloom\", \n \"Vivian Bloodmark\", \"Blavdak Vinomori\", or \n \"Dorian Vivalkomb\"\n* \"Ted Morgan\" = \"(Sanche) de Gramont\"\n* \"Dave Barry\" = \"Ray Adverb\"\n* \"Glen Duncan\" = \"Declan Gunn\"I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)\n* \"Damon Albarn\" = \"Dan Abnormal\"\n*\"Anna Madrigal\" = \"A man and a girl\"\n* \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\" = \"I am Lord Voldemort\"\n* \"Buckethead\" = \"Death Cube K\"\n* \"Daniel Clowes\" = \"Enid Coleslaw\"\n*\"Siobhán Donaghy\" = \"Shanghai Nobody\"\nSeveral of these are \"imperfect anagrams\", letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.\n\nTitles\n\nAnagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:\n* Homer Hickam, Jr.'s book Rocket Boys was adapted into the 1999 film October Sky.\n* The tapes for the revival of the BBC show Doctor Who were labeled with the anagram Torchwood, which later went on to be used as the name for a spin-off show.\n* The 1980s TV series The A-Team had a Season 1 anagram episode called \"Black Day at Bad Rock\", a word play on the 1955 Spenser Tracy western movie, Bad Day at Black Rock.\n* The New Wave band Missing Persons' best-selling album was called Spring Session M.\n* Hip-hop artist MF DOOM recorded a 2004 album called MM..FOOD.\n* Brian Eno's album Before and After Science includes a song entitled \"King's Lead Hat\", an anagram of \"Talking Heads\", a band Eno has worked with.\n* Juan Maria Solare's piano ballad \"Jura ser anomalía\" (literally \"he/she swears to be an anomaly\") is an anagram of the composer's full name. His composition for English horn titled \"A Dot in Time\" is an anagram of \"Meditation\", which describes the piece. The title of his piano piece that is an homage to Claude Debussy is \"Seduce Us Badly\".\n* Bill Evans's overdubbed piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist Sonny Clark is titled \"N.Y.C.'s No Lark,\" and another composition, \"Re: Person I Knew\" is a tribute to his producer, Orrin Keepnews.\n* The title of Imogen Heap's album iMegaphone is an anagram of her name.\n* Progressive rock group Rush published a song off their 1989 album Presto titled \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song.\n* The title of the fifth album by American rock band Interpol, El Pintor, is an anagram of the band's name and also Spanish for \"the painter\".\n\nCoincidences\n\nIn Hebrew, the name \"Gernot Zippe\" (גרנוט ציפה), the inventor of the Zippe-type centrifuge, is an anagram of the word \"Centrifuge\" (צנטריפוגה).\n\nGames and puzzles\n\nAnagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The Jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. Cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like \"confused\" or \"in disarray\". An example would be Businessman burst into tears (9 letters). The solution, stationer, is an anagram of into tears, the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of businessman.\n\nNumerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:\n* In Anagrams, players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can \"steal\" each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.\n* In a version of Scrabble called Clabbers, the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.\n* On the British game show Countdown, contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.\n* In Boggle, players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.\n* On the British game show BrainTeaser, contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a \"Pyramid\" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.\n* In Bananagrams, players place tiles from a pool into crossword-style word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.\n* Other anagram games include Bonza (Word Game), Bookworm (video game), Dabble, Jumble, Letterpress (video game), Perquackey, Puzzlage, Word Force, WordSpot, and Words with Friends.\n\nCiphers\n\nMultiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a permutation cipher, a transposition cipher, and the Jefferson disk.[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary]. Codesandciphers.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-12. Solutions may be computationally found using a Jumble algorithm.\n\nMethods of construction\n\nSometimes, it is possible to \"see\" anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. Anagram dictionaries could also be used. Computer programs, known as \"anagram solvers\" or \"anagrammers\", offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet.\n\nThe program or server carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a jumble algorithm. Some programs (such as Lexpert) restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, [http://findwords.online4me.com The Words Oracle]) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.\n\nSome anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done \"manually\" or \"by hand\"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted \"by machine\" or \"by computer\", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using Anagram Genius).\n\nThere are also a few \"natural\" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French chaise longue (\"long chair\") became the American \"chaise lounge\" by metathesis (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English \"curd\" comes from the Latin crudus (\"raw\"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was \"brid\".",

For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called \"anagram solution tasks\", to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike.Java, Rosalind I. \"Priming and Aging: Evidence of Preserved Memory Function in an Anagram Solution Task.\" The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 105, No. 4. (Winter, 1992), pp. 541–548.\n\nEstablishment of priority\n\nNatural philosophers (astronomers and others) of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into Latin anagrams, to establish their priority. In this way they laid claim to new discoveries, before their results were ready for publication.\n\nGalileo used smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras for Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\") for discovering the rings of Saturn in 1610.\n Galileo announced his discovery that Venus had phases like the Moon in the form \"Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur oy\" (Latin: These immature ones have already been read in vain by me -oy), that is, when rearranged, \"Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum\" (Latin: The Mother of Loves [Venus] imitates the figures of Cynthia [\n the moon]). In both cases, Johannes Kepler had solved the anagrams incorrectly, assuming they were talking about the Moons of Mars and a red spot on Jupiter, respectively.[http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/62652246148/galileo-kepler-two-anagrams-two-wrong Galileo, Kepler, & Two Anagrams: Two Wrong Solutions Turn Into Two Correct Solutions] By coincidence, he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing.\n\nIn 1656, Christiaan Huygens, using a telescope superior to those available to Galileo, figured that Galileo's earlier observations of Saturn actually meant it had a ring (Galileo's tools were only sufficient to see it as bumps) and, like Galileo, had published an anagram saying \"aaaaaaacccccdeeeeeghiiiiiiillllmmnnnnnnnnnooooppqrrstttttuuuuu\". Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean \"Annuto cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato\"; that is, \"It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic\".\n\nWhen Robert Hooke discovered Hooke's law in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, ceiiinosssttuv, for ut tensio, sic vis (Latin: as the tension, so the force).Derek Gjertsen, The Newton Handbook (1986), p. 16.\n\nIn a related use, from 1975, British naturalist Sir Peter Scott coined the scientific term \"Nessiteras rhombopteryx\" (Greek for \"The monster (or wonder) of Ness with the diamond-shaped fin\") for the apocryphal Loch Ness Monster.Sir Peter Scott, Robert Rines: \"Naming the Loch Ness monster\", Nature 258, 11 December 1975, 466–468,  Shortly afterwards, several London newspapers pointed out that \"Nessiteras rhombopteryx\" anagrams into \"Monster hoax by Sir Peter S\". However, Robert Rines, who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster, countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into \"Yes, both pix are monsters, R.\"Article, \"Monster Hoax?\", in New Scientist, Christmas Double Issue, Volume 68, Number 980, page 739 (18–25 December 1975).\n\nPseudonyms\n\nAnagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity. For example, Jim Morrison used an anagram of his name in The Doors song L.A. Woman, calling himself \"Mr. Mojo Risin' \". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when Edward Cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the House of Commons.[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html Institute of Historical Research (IHR) home page] In a genre such as farce or parody, anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.\n\nPseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus \"Calvinus\" becomes \"Alcuinus\" (here V U) or \"François Rabelais\" \n \"Alcofribas Nasier\". The name \"Voltaire\" of François Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of \"Arouet, l[e] j[eune]\" (U V, J \n I) that is, \"Arouet the younger\". Other examples include\n* \"Arrigo Boito\" = \"Tobia Gorrio\"\n* \"Edward Gorey\" \"Ogdred Weary\", \n \"Regera Dowdy\" or = \"E. G. Deadworry\" (and others)\n* \"Vladimir Nabokov\" \"Vivian Darkbloom\", \n \"Vivian Bloodmark\", \"Blavdak Vinomori\", or \n \"Dorian Vivalkomb\"\n* \"Ted Morgan\" = \"(Sanche) de Gramont\"\n* \"Dave Barry\" = \"Ray Adverb\"\n* \"Glen Duncan\" = \"Declan Gunn\"I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)\n* \"Damon Albarn\" = \"Dan Abnormal\"\n*\"Anna Madrigal\" = \"A man and a girl\"\n* \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\" = \"I am Lord Voldemort\"\n* \"Buckethead\" = \"Death Cube K\"\n* \"Daniel Clowes\" = \"Enid Coleslaw\"\n*\"Siobhán Donaghy\" = \"Shanghai Nobody\"\nSeveral of these are \"imperfect anagrams\", letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.\n\nTitles\n\nAnagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:\n* Homer Hickam, Jr.'s book Rocket Boys was adapted into the 1999 film October Sky.\n* The tapes for the revival of the BBC show Doctor Who were labeled with the anagram Torchwood, which later went on to be used as the name for a spin-off show.\n* The 1980s TV series The A-Team had a Season 1 anagram episode called \"Black Day at Bad Rock\", a word play on the 1955 Spenser Tracy western movie, Bad Day at Black Rock.\n* The New Wave band Missing Persons' best-selling album was called Spring Session M.\n* Hip-hop artist MF DOOM recorded a 2004 album called MM..FOOD.\n* Brian Eno's album Before and After Science includes a song entitled \"King's Lead Hat\", an anagram of \"Talking Heads\", a band Eno has worked with.\n* Juan Maria Solare's piano ballad \"Jura ser anomalía\" (literally \"he/she swears to be an anomaly\") is an anagram of the composer's full name. His composition for English horn titled \"A Dot in Time\" is an anagram of \"Meditation\", which describes the piece. The title of his piano piece that is an homage to Claude Debussy is \"Seduce Us Badly\".\n* Bill Evans's overdubbed piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist Sonny Clark is titled \"N.Y.C.'s No Lark,\" and another composition, \"Re: Person I Knew\" is a tribute to his producer, Orrin Keepnews.\n* The title of Imogen Heap's album iMegaphone is an anagram of her name.\n* Progressive rock group Rush published a song off their 1989 album Presto titled \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song.\n* The title of the fifth album by American rock band Interpol, El Pintor, is an anagram of the band's name and also Spanish for \"the painter\".\n\nCoincidences\n\nIn Hebrew, the name \"Gernot Zippe\" (גרנוט ציפה), the inventor of the Zippe-type centrifuge, is an anagram of the word \"Centrifuge\" (צנטריפוגה).\n\nGames and puzzles\n\nAnagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The Jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. Cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like \"confused\" or \"in disarray\". An example would be Businessman burst into tears (9 letters). The solution, stationer, is an anagram of into tears, the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of businessman.\n\nNumerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:\n* In Anagrams, players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can \"steal\" each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.\n* In a version of Scrabble called Clabbers, the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.\n* On the British game show Countdown, contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.\n* In Boggle, players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.\n* On the British game show BrainTeaser, contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a \"Pyramid\" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.\n* In Bananagrams, players place tiles from a pool into crossword-style word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.\n* Other anagram games include Bonza (Word Game), Bookworm (video game), Dabble, Jumble, Letterpress (video game), Perquackey, Puzzlage, Word Force, WordSpot, and Words with Friends.\n\nCiphers\n\nMultiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a permutation cipher, a transposition cipher, and the Jefferson disk.[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary]. Codesandciphers.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-12. Solutions may be computationally found using a Jumble algorithm.\n\nMethods of construction\n\nSometimes, it is possible to \"see\" anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. Anagram dictionaries could also be used. Computer programs, known as \"anagram solvers\" or \"anagrammers\", offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet.\n\nThe program or server carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a jumble algorithm. Some programs (such as Lexpert) restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, [http://findwords.online4me.com The Words Oracle]) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.\n\nSome anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done \"manually\" or \"by hand\"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted \"by machine\" or \"by computer\", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using Anagram Genius).\n\nThere are also a few \"natural\" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French chaise longue (\"long chair\") became the American \"chaise lounge\" by metathesis (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English \"curd\" comes from the Latin crudus (\"raw\"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was \"brid\". Anagram. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1361."
