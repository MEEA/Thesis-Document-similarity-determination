  "textBody" : "Maastricht (;Local pronunciation: Limburgish : Mestreech; French: Maestricht ; Spanish: Mastrique ) is a city and a municipality in the southeast of the Netherlands. It is the capital and largest city of the province of Limburg. Maastricht is located on both sides of the Meuse river (Dutch: Maas), at the point where the Jeker river joins it. It is adjacent to the border with Belgium.\n\nMaastricht developed from a Roman settlement to a Medieval religious centre. In the 16th century it became a garrison town and in the 19th century an early industrial city. Today, the town is a thriving cultural and regional hub. It became well-known through the Maastricht Treaty and as the birthplace of the euro. Maastricht has 1677 national heritage buildings (Rijksmonumenten), the second highest number in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. The town is popular with tourists for shopping and recreation, and has a large international student population. Maastricht is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network and is part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion, which includes nearby German and Belgian cities Aachen, Eupen, Hasselt, Liège and Tongeren. The Meuse-Rhine Euroregion is a metropolis with a population of about 3.9 million with several international universities.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Maastricht is derived from Latin Traiectum ad Mosam (or Traiectum Mosae), meaning 'crossing at the Meuse', and referring to the bridge built by the Romans. The Latin name first appears in medieval documentsAs Treiectinsem urbem, \"the city of Trajectum\", in Gregory of Tours, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gregorytours/gregorytours2.shtml Historia Francorum, 2, 5] (late 6th ct.). M. Gysseling, Toponymisch Woordenboek van België, Nederland, Luxemburg, Noord-Frankrijk en West-Duitsland (vóór 1226) (Tongeren, 1960) [http://bouwstoffen.kantl.be/tw/facsimile/?find=maastricht p. 646]. and it is not known whether this was Maastricht's official name during Roman times. A resident of Maastricht is referred to as Maastrichtenaar whilst in the local dialect it is either Mestreechteneer or, colloquially, Sjeng (derived from the formerly popular French name Jean).\n\nEarly history\n\nNeanderthal remains have been found to the west of Maastricht (Belvédère excavations). Of a later date are Palaeolithic remains, between 8,000 and 25,000 years old. Celts lived here around 500 BC, at a spot where the river Meuse was shallow and therefore easy to cross.\n\nIt is not known when the Romans arrived in Maastricht, or whether the settlement was founded by them. The Romans built a bridge over the Meuse in the 1st century AD, during the reign of Augustus Caesar. The bridge was an important link in the main road between Bavay and Cologne. Roman Maastricht was probably relatively small. Remains of the Roman road, the bridge, a religious shrine, a Roman bath, a granary, some houses and the 4th-century castrum walls and gates, have been excavated. Fragments of provincial Roman sculptures, as well as coins, jewelry, glass, pottery and other objects from Roman Maastricht are on display in the exhibition space of the city's public library (Centre Céramique).\n\nAccording to legend, the Armenian-born Saint Servatius, Bishop of Tongeren, died in Maastricht in 384 and was buried there along the Roman road, outside the castrum. According to Gregory of Tours it was bishop Monulph who, around 570, built the first stone church on the grave of Servatius, the present-day Basilica of Saint Servatius. The city remained an early Christian diocese until it lost this position to nearby Liège in the early 8th century.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nIn the early Middle Ages Maastricht was part of the heartland of the Carolingian Empire along with Aachen and the area around Liège. The town was an important centre for trade and manufacturing. Merovingian coins minted in Maastricht have been found in many places throughout Europe. In the 10th century Maastricht briefly became the capital of the duchy of Lower Lorraine.\n\nDuring the 12th century the town flourished culturally. The provosts of the church of Saint Servatius held important positions in the Holy Roman Empire during this era. The city's two main churches were largely rebuilt and redecorated. Maastricht Romanesque stone sculpture is regarded as one of the highlights of Mosan art. Maastricht painters were praised by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his Parzival. Around the same time, the poet Henric van Veldeke wrote a legend of Saint Servatius, one of the earliest works in Dutch literature.\n\nUnlike most Dutch towns, Maastricht did not receive city rights at a certain date. These developed gradually during its long history. In 1204 the city's dual authority was formalised in a treaty, with the prince-bishops of Liège and the dukes of Brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city. Soon afterwards the first ring of medieval walls were built. In 1275, the old Roman bridge collapsed under the weight of a large procession, killing 400 people; a replacement, the Sint Servaasbrug, was built to the north from 1280 to 1298, funded by church indulgences..\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the city remained a centre for trade and manufacturing of wool and leather but gradually economic decline set in. After a brief period of economic prosperity around 1500, the city's economy suffered during the wars of religion of the 16th and 17th centuries, and recovery did not happen until the industrial revolution in the early 19th century.\n\n16th to 19th centuries\n\nThe important strategic location of Maastricht resulted in the construction of an impressive array of fortifications around the city during this period. The Spanish and Dutch garrisons became an important factor in the city's economy. In 1579 the city was sacked by the Spanish army under general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma (Siege of Maastricht, 1579). For over fifty years the Spanish crown took over the role of the dukes of Brabant in the joint sovereignty over Maastricht. In 1632 the city was conquered by Prince Frederick Henry of Orange and the Dutch States General replaced the Spanish crown in the joint government of Maastricht.\n\nAnother Siege of Maastricht (1673) took place during the Franco-Dutch War. In June 1673, Louis XIV laid siege to the city because French battle supply lines were being threatened. During this siege, Vauban, the famous French military engineer, developed a new strategy in order to break down the strong fortifications surrounding Maastricht. His systematic approach remained the standard method of attacking fortresses until the 20th century. On 25 June 1673, while preparing to storm the city, captain-lieutenant Charles de Batz de Castelmore, also known as the comte d'Artagnan, was killed by a musket shot outside Tongerse Poort. This event was embellished in Alexandre Dumas' novel The Vicomte de Bragelonne, part of the D'Artagnan Romances. French troops occupied Maastricht from 1673 to 1678.\n\nIn 1748 the French again conquered the city at what is known as the Second French Siege of Maastricht, during the War of Austrian Succession. The French took the city for the last time in 1794, when the condominium was dissolved and Maastricht was annexed to the First French Empire (1794–1814). For twenty years Maastricht was the capital of the French département of Meuse-Inférieure.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic era, Maastricht became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. It was made the capital of the newly formed Province of Limburg (1815–1839). When the southern provinces of the newly formed kingdom seceded in 1830, the Dutch garrison in Maastricht remained loyal to the Dutch king, William I, even when most of the inhabitants of the town and the surrounding area sided with the Belgian revolutionaries. In 1831, arbitration by the Great Powers allocated the city to the Netherlands. However, neither the Dutch nor the Belgians agreed to this and the arrangement was not implemented until the 1839 Treaty of London. During this period of isolation Maastricht developed into an early industrial town.\n\nBecause of its eccentric location in the southeastern Netherlands, and its geographical and cultural proximity to Belgium and Germany, integration of Maastricht and Limburg into the Netherlands did not come about easily. Maastricht retained a distinctly non-Dutch appearance during much of the 19th century and it was not until the First World War that the city was forced to look northwards.\n\n20th century and onwards\n\nEarly in World War II, the city was taken by the Germans during the Battle of Maastricht in May 1940. On 13 and 14 September 1944 it was the first Dutch city to be liberated by Allied forces. The three Meuse bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the war. As elsewhere in the Netherlands, the majority of Maastricht Jews died in Nazi concentration camps.About 77% of Maastricht's relatively small Jewish community of 505 members did not survive the war.  (2005): Historische Encyclopedie Maastricht, pp. 256-257. Walburg Pers, Zutphen. .\n\nDuring the latter half of the century, traditional industries (such as the famous Maastricht potteries) declined and the city shifted to a service economy. Maastricht University was founded in 1976. Several European institutions have found their base in Maastricht. In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated and signed here, leading to the creation of the European Union and the euro.Gnesotto, N. (1992). European union after Minsk and Maastricht. International Affairs. 68(2), 223-232.\n\nIn recent years, under mayor Gerd Leers, Maastricht launched a campaign against drug-related problems. Leers instigated a controversial plan to relocate some of the cannabis coffee shops—where the purchase of soft drugs in limited quantities is tolerated—from the city centre to the outskirts, in an attempt to stop foreign buyers from causing trouble in the downtown area. Although the so-called \"coffee corner plan\" has not been entirely abandoned, the new mayor Onno Hoes has given priority to the Dutch government's approach of limiting entrance to 'coffee shops' to Dutch adults only, and to tackle the problem of drug runners in cooperation with the city of Rotterdam (where the majority of drug runners are from).\n\nLarge parts of the city centre have been redeveloped, including the area around the main railway station, the main shopping streets, the Entre Deux and Mosae Forum shopping centres, and the Maasboulevard promenade along the Meuse. Also, a new quarter, including the new Bonnefanten Museum, a public library, a theatre and several housing blocks designed by international architects, was built on the grounds of the former Céramique potteries near the town centre. As a result, Maastricht looks notably smarter. Further large-scale projects, such as the redevelopment of the Sphinx and Belvédère areas, are underway.\n\nGeography\n\nNeighbourhoods\n\nMaastricht consists of five districts (stadsdelen) and 44 neighbourhoods (wijken). Each neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its postal code.\n\n# Maastricht Centrum (Binnenstad, Jekerkwartier, Kommelkwartier, Statenkwartier, Boschstraatkwartier, Sint Maartenspoort, Wyck-Céramique)\n# South-West (Villapark, Jekerdal, Biesland, Campagne, Wolder, Sint Pieter)\n# North-West (Brusselsepoort, Mariaberg, Belfort, Pottenberg, Malpertuis, Caberg, Malberg, Dousberg-Hazendans, Daalhof, Boschpoort, Bosscherveld, Frontenkwartier, Belvédère, Lanakerveld)\n# North-East (Beatrixhaven, Borgharen, Itteren, Meerssenhoven, Wyckerpoort, Wittevrouwenveld, Nazareth, Limmel, Amby)\n# South-East (Randwyck, Heugem, Heugemerveld, Scharn, Heer, De Heeg, Vroendaal)\n\nThe neighbourhoods of Itteren, Borgharen, Limmel, Amby, Heer, Heugem, Scharn, Oud-Caberg, Sint Pieter and Wolder all used to be separate municipalities or villages until they were annexed by the city of Maastricht in the course of the 20th century.\n\nNeighbouring villages\n\nThe outlying areas of the following villages are bordering the municipality of Maastricht directly, which means among others that in many a case a considerable number of their inhabitants originate from Maastricht.\n\nClockwise from north to northwest:\n\n*Neerharen (B), \n*Bunde, \n*Meerssen, \n*Berg en Terblijt, \n*Bemelen, \n*Cadier en Keer, \n*Gronsveld,\n*Oost, \n*Ternaaien (B), \n*Kanne (B), \n*Vroenhoven (B), \n*Kesselt (B), \n*Veldwezelt (B), \n*Petit Lanaye (B),\n*Lanaken (B).\n\n(B = Situated in Belgium)\n\nBorder\n\nMaastricht's city limits has an international border with Belgium. Most of it borders Belgium's Flemish region, but a small part to the south also has a border with the Walloon region. Both countries are part of Europe's Schengen Area thus are open without border controls.\n\nClimate\n\nMaastricht features the same climate as most of the Netherlands (Cfb, Oceanic climate), however, due to its more inland location in between hills, summers tend to be warmer (especially in the Meuse valley, which lies 70 metres lower than the meteorological station) and winters a bit colder, although the difference is only remarkable at a few days a year. The second highest temperature in the Netherlands, and the highest temperature of a still existing station was recorded on 2 July 2015 at .\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population\n\nInhabitants by nationality\n\nInhabitants by country of birth\n\nLanguages\n\nMaastricht is a city of linguistic diversity, partly as a result of its location at the crossroads of multiple language areas and its international student population.\n\n* Dutch is the national language and the language of elementary and secondary education (excluding international institutions) as well as administration. Dutch in Maastricht is often spoken with a distinctive Limburgish accent, which should not be confused with the Limburgish language.\n* Limburgish (or Limburgian) is the overlapping term of the tonal dialects spoken in the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg. The Maastrichtian dialect (Mestreechs) is only one of many variants of Limburgish. It is characterised by stretched vowels and some French influence on its vocabulary. In recent years the Maastricht dialect has been in decline (see dialect levelling) and a language switch to Standard Dutch has been noted.\n* French used to be the language of education in Maastricht. In the 18th century the language occupied a powerful position as judicial and cultural language, and it was used throughout the following century by the upper classes.  Between 1851 and 1892 a Francophone newspaper (Le Courrier de la Meuse) was published in Maastricht. The language is often part of secondary school curricula. Many proper names and some street names are French and the language has left many traces in the local dialect.\n* German, like French, is often part of secondary school curricula. Due to Maastricht's geographic proximity to Germany and the great number of German students in the city, German is widely spoken.\n* English has become an important language in education. At Maastricht University and Hogeschool Zuyd it is the language of instruction for many courses. Many foreign students and expatriates use English as a lingua franca. English is also a mandatory subject in Dutch elementary and secondary schools.\n\nReligion\n\nThe largest religion in Maastricht is Christianity with 65.1% of the population that is Christian, of whom 92.31% is Catholic.\n\nEconomy\n\nPrivate companies based in Maastricht\n\n* ENCI – First Dutch Cement Industry\n* Sappi – South African Pulp and Paper Industry\n* Mosa – ceramic tiles\n* BASF – previously Ten Horn, pigments\n* Hewlett-Packard – previously Indigo, manufacturer of electronic data systems\n* Vodafone – mobile phone company\n* DHL – international express mail services\n* Teleperformance – contact center services\n* Mercedes-Benz – customer contact centre for Europe\n* VGZ – health insurance, customer contact centre\n* Esaote (former Pie Medical Equipment) – manufacturer of medical and veterinary diagnostic equipment\n* Pie Medical Imaging – cardiovascular quantitative analysis software\n* CardioTek – manufacturer of medical equipment for Cardiac electrophysiology procedures\n* BioPartner Centre Maastricht – life sciences spin-off companies\n\nPublic institutions\n\nSince the 1980s a number of European and international institutions have made Maastricht their base.

Other extensions of the park are called Kempland, Henri Hermanspark, Monseigneur Nolenspark and Waldeckpark. From 2014 onwards, the grounds of the former Tapijn military barracks will be gradually added to the park;\n* Jekerpark, a new park along the river Jeker, separated from Stadspark by a busy road;\n* Frontenpark, a new park west of the city centre, incorporating parts of the fortifications of Maastricht from the 17th to 19th centuries;\n* Charles Eykpark, a modern park between the public library and Bonnefanten Museum on the east bank of the Meuse river, designed in the late 1990s by Swedish landscape architect Gunnar Martinsson.\n* Griendpark, a modern park on the east bank of the river with an inline-skating and skateboarding course.\n* Geusseltpark in eastern Maastricht and J.J. van de Vennepark in western Maastricht, both with elaborate sports facilities.\n\nNatural areas\n\n* The Meuse river and its green banks in outlying areas. In the northern areas around Itteren and Borgharen 'new nature' is being created in combination with river protection measures and gravel mining.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Meuse_River_in_Maastricht Commons images Meuse_River_in_Maastricht]\n* Pietersplas, an artificial lake between Maastricht and Gronsveld that was the result of gravel pits on the banks of the Meuse river. There is a beach on the northern slope of the lake and a marina near Castle Hoogenweerth. The eastern riverbed between Pietersplas and the provincial government building is a nature reserve (Kleine Weerd).\n* The Jeker Valley, along the river Jeker, starts near the city centre in Stadspark and leads via Jekerpark to an area with green meadows, fertile fields, some vineyards on the slopes of Cannerberg, several water mills and Château Neercanne, and continues further south into Belgium.\n* The green flanks of Mount Saint Peter, including many footpaths.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sint_Pietersberg Commons images Mount Saint Peter] \n* Dousberg and Zouwdal, a modest hill and valley surrounded by urban development on the western edge of the city, partly in Belgium. A large part of the hill is now in use as an international golf course (Golfclub Maastricht).[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dousberg Commons images Dousberg]\n* Landgoederenzone, an extended area in the northeast of Maastricht (partly in Meerssen) consisting of around fifteen country estates, such as Severen, Geusselt, Bethlehem, Mariënwaard, Kruisdonk, Vaeshartelt, Meerssenhoven, Borgharen and Hartelstein. Some of the castles, villas and stately homes are surrounded by industrial areas or quarries.\n* Picturesque bike paths through agricultural areas in several outlying quarters (like \"Biesland\" and \"Wolder\").\n\nSports\n\n* In football, Maastricht is represented by MVV Maastricht (Dutch: Maatschappelijke Voetbal Vereniging Maastricht), who (as of the 2016–2017 season) play in the Dutch first division of the national competition (which is the second league after the Eredivisie league). MVV's home is the Geusselt stadium near the A2 motorway.\n* Maastricht is also home to the Maastricht Wildcats, an American Football League team and member of the AFBN (American Football Bond Nederland).\n* Since 1998, Maastricht has been the traditional starting place of the annual Amstel Gold Race, the only Dutch cycling classic. For several years the race also finished in Maastricht, but since 2002 the finale has been on the Cauberg hill in nearby Valkenburg. Tom Dumoulin was born in Maastricht.\n* Since 2000, Maastricht has been the first city in the Netherland with a lacrosse team. The Student Sport Association \"Maaslax\" is closely linked to Maastricht University and member of the NLB (Nederland Lacrosse Bond).\n\nPolitics\n\nCity council\n\nThe municipal government of Maastricht consists of a city council, a mayor and a number of aldermen. The city council, a 39-member legislative body directly elected for four years, appoints the aldermen on the basis of a coalition agreement between two or more parties after each election. The 2006 municipal elections in the Netherlands were, as often, dominated by national politics and led to a shift from right to left throughout the country. In Maastricht, the traditional broad governing coalition of Christian Democrats (CDA), Labour (PvdA), Greens (GreenLeft) and Liberals (VVD) was replaced by a centre-left coalition of Labour, Christian Democrats and Greens. Two Labour aldermen were appointed, along with one Christian Democrat and one Green alderman. Due to internal disagreements, one of the VVD council members left the party in 2005 and formed a new liberal group in 2006 (Liberalen Maastricht). The other opposition parties in the current city council are the Socialist Party (SP), the Democrats (D66) and two local parties (Stadsbelangen Mestreech (SBM) and the Seniorenpartij).\n\nAldermen and mayors\n\nThe aldermen and the mayor make up the executive branch of the municipal government. After the popular previous mayor, Gerd Leers (CDA), decided to step down in January 2010 following the 'Bulgarian Villa' affair, an affair concerning a holiday villa project in Byala, Bulgaria, in which the mayor was alleged to have been involved in shady deals to raise the value of villas he had ownership of. Up until July 1, 2015 the mayor of Maastricht was Onno Hoes, a Liberal (VVD), the only male mayor in the country, who officially was married to a male person. In 2013 Hoes was the subject of some political commotion, after facts had been disclosed about intimate affairs with several other male persons. The affair had no consequences for his political career.[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22152141/__Onno_Hoes_mag_blijven__.html Article in a Dutch paper about the political impact of mayor Onno Hoes' personal demeanour.] Because of a new affair in 2014 Hoes eventually stepped down.Grindstad, Ingrid.

Retrieved on 10 December 2014.\n\nSince July 1, 2015 the current mayor of Maastricht has been Annemarie Penn-te Strake.[http://www.1limburg.nl/annemarie-penn-geinstalleerd-als-burgemeester-maastricht Article about the installment of Penn as mayor] Penn is independent and serves no political party, although her husband is a former chairman of the Maastricht Seniorenpartij.[http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4036864/annemarie-penn-nieuwe-burgemeester-maastricht.html Article with details about her political career] She has served for the Dutch judicial system for many years in many different positions. During her tenure as mayor she still serves as attorney general.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075229/https://www.om.nl/organisatie/procureurs-generaal/mr-penn-strake/ Penn's history in the Dutch judicial system]\n\nCannabis\n\nOne controversial issue which has dominated Maastricht politics for many years and which has also affected national and international politics, is the city's approach to soft drugs. Under the pragmatic Dutch soft drug policy, a policy of non-enforcement, individuals may buy and use cannabis from 'coffeeshops' (cannabis bars) under certain conditions. Maastricht, like many other border towns, has seen a growing influx of 'drug tourists', mainly young people from Belgium, France and Germany, who provide a large amount of revenue for the coffeeshops (around 13) in the city centre. The city government, most notably ex-mayor Leers, have been actively promoting drug policy reform in order to deal with its negative side effects.\n\nOne of the proposals, known as the 'Coffee Corner Plan', proposed by then-mayor Leers and supported unanimously by the city council in 2008, was to relocate the coffeeshops from the city centre to the outskirts of the town (in some cases near the national Dutch-Belgian border).[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/world/europe/20dutch.html?scp4&sq\nmaastricht%20drugs&st=cse Cannabis Cafes Get Nudge to Fringes of a Dutch City], The New York Times, 20 August 2006. The purpose of this plan was to reduce the impact of drug tourism on the city centre, such as parking problems and the illegal sale of hard drugs in the vicinity of the coffeeshops, and to monitor the sale and use of cannabis more closely in areas away from the crowded city centre. The Coffee Corner Plan, however, has met with fierce opposition from neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and from members of the Dutch and Belgian parliament. The plan has been the subject of various legal challenges and has not been carried out up to this date (2014).\n\nOn 16 December 2010, the Court of Justice of the European Union upheld a local Maastricht ban on the sale of cannabis to foreign tourists, restricting entrance to coffee shops to residents of Maastricht. The ban did not affect scientific or medical usage. In 2011, the Dutch government introduced a similar national system, the wietpas (\"cannabis pass\"), restricting access to Dutch coffeeshops to residents of the Netherlands. After protests from local mayors about the difficulty of implementing the issuing of wietpasses, Dutch parliament in 2012 agreed to replace the pass by any proof of residency. The new system has led to a slight reduction in drug tourism to cannabis shops in Maastricht but at the same time to an increase of drug dealing on the street.\n\nTransport\n\nBy car\n\nMaastricht is served by the A2 and A79 motorways. The city can be reached from Brussels and Cologne in approximately one hour and from Amsterdam in about two and a half hours.\n\nThe A2 motorway that runs through Maastricht in a double decked tunnel. Before 2016 the A2 motorway ran through the city and was heavily congested and caused air pollution in the urban area. Construction of a two-level tunnel designed to solve these problems started in 2011 and was opened (in stages) by December 2016.[http://www.a2maastricht.nl/page.aspx?id=334 A2maastricht.nl]\n\nIn spite of several large underground car parks, parking in the city centre forms a major problem during weekends and bank holidays due to the large numbers of visitors. Parking fees are high in order to incite visitors to use public transport or park and ride facilities away from the centre.\n\nBy train\n\nMaastricht is served by three rail operators, all of which call at the main Maastricht railway station near the centre and the smaller Maastricht Randwyck, located near the business and university district, and Maastricht Noord, which opened in 2013. Intercity trains northwards to Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Den Bosch and Utrecht are operated by Dutch Railways. The National Railway Company of Belgium runs south to Liège in Belgium. The line to Heerlen, Valkenburg and Kerkrade is operated by Arriva. The former railway to Aachen was closed down in the 1980s. A small section of the old westbound railway to Hasselt (Belgium) was restored in recent years and will be used as a modern tramline, scheduled to open in 2023.\n\nBy tram\n\nThe Dutch and Flanders governments have reached an agreement in 2014 to build a new tram route called Spartacus. It is scheduled to take three years, from 2015 to 2018, and cost €283 million. When it is completed, Spartacus will carry passengers from Maastricht city centre to Hasselt city centre, the capital of Flanders’ Limburg province, in 30 minutes. It will be operated by the transport company De Lijn, with 3 scheduled stops in Maastricht and further 10 in Flanders.\n\nBy bus\n\nRegular bus lines connect the city centre, outer areas, business districts and railway stations. The regional Veolia bus network extends to most parts of South Limburg as well as to Hasselt, Tongeren, Maasmechelen and Liège in Belgium, and Aachen in Germany.\n\nBy air\n\nMaastricht is served by the nearby Maastricht Aachen Airport  – located in nearby Beek and informally referred to by that name. The airport is served by Corendon Dutch Airlines and Ryanair. The airport has regular scheduled flights to destinations around the Mediterranean, as well as charter flights to Lourdes and operated by Enter Air. The airport is located about 10 km north of Maastricht's centre.\n\nBy boat\n\nMaastricht has a river port (Beatrixhaven) and is connected by water with Belgium and the rest of the Netherlands through the river Meuse, the Juliana Canal, the Albert Canal and the Zuid-Willemsvaart. Although there are no regular boat connections to other cities, various organized boat trips for tourists connect Maastricht with Belgium cities such as Liège.\n\nDistances to other cities\n\nThese distances are as the crow flies and therefore not represent actual overland distances.\n\n* Liège:  south\n* Aachen:  east\n* Eindhoven:  north-west\n* Düsseldorf:  north-east\n* Cologne:  east\n* Brussels:  west\n* Antwerp:  north-west\n* Bonn:  south-east\n* Charleroi:  south-west\n* Luxembourg City:  south\n* Ghent:  west\n* Utrecht:  north-west\n* Rotterdam:  north-west\n* Amsterdam:  north-west\n* Lille:  west\n* Frankfurt am Main:  south-east\n* Groningen:  north\n* Strasbourg:  south-west\n* Paris:  south-west\n* Hannover:  north-east\n* Stuttgart:  south-east\n* Basel:  south-east\n* London:  north-west\n* Zürich:  south-east\n\nEducation\n\nSecondary education\n\n* Bernard Lievegoedschool (Anthroposophical education)\n* Bonnefantencollege\n* Porta Mosana College\n* Sint-Maartenscollege\n* United World College Maastricht\n\nTertiary education\n\n* Maastricht University (Dutch: Universiteit Maastricht or UM)  including:\n** University College Maastricht\n* Maastricht School of Management\n* Teikyo University (Maastricht campus closed in 2007)\n* Zuyd University of Applied Sciences (Dutch: Hogeschool Zuyd, also has departments in Sittard and Heerlen) including:\n** Academy for Dramatic Arts Maastricht (Dutch: Toneelacademie Maastricht)\n** School of Fine Arts Maastricht (Dutch: Academie Beeldende Kunsten Maastricht)\n** Maastricht Academy of Music (Dutch: Conservatorium Maastricht)\n** Academy of architecture\n** Teachers training college\n** Faculty of International Business and Communication\n** Maastricht Hotel Management School\n\nOther\n\n* Jan Van Eyck Academie - post-academic art institute\n* Berlitz Language School Maastricht\n* Talenacademie Nederland\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns — sister cities\n\nMaastricht is twinned with:\n* Liège, Belgium\n* Koblenz, Germany\n* Rama, Nicaragua\n* Chengdu, China (since 2012)\n\nOther relations\n\n* Most Ancient European Towns Network\n\nNotable people\n\nBorn in Maastricht\n\n* Jean-Eugène-Charles Alberti (1777 – after 1843) – painter\n* Henri Arends (1921–1993) – conductor\n* Doris Baaten (born 1956) – voice actress\n* Mieke de Boer (born 1980) – female darts player\n* Alphons Boosten (1893–1951) – architect\n* Theo Bovens (born 1959) – politician\n* Joseph Bruyère (born 1948) – Belgian cyclist\n* Jean-Baptiste Coclers (1696–1772) – painter\n* Louis Bernard Coclers (1740–1817) – painter\n* Peter Debye (1884–1966) – Nobel prize winning chemist\n* Tom Dumoulin (born 1990) – cyclist, Giro d'Italia winner\n* Hendrick Fromantiou (1633/4 – after 1693) – still life painter\n* Joop Haex (1911–2002) – politician\n* André Henri Constant van Hasselt (1806–1874) – French-writing poet\n* Hubert Hermans (born 1937) – psychologist and creator of Dialogical Self Theory\n* Pieter van den Hoogenband (born 1978) – swimmer and a triple Olympic champion\n* Pierre Kemp (1886–1967) – poet\n* Sjeng Kerbusch (1947–1991) – behavior geneticist\n* Mathieu Kessels (1784–1836) – sculptor\n* Lambert of Maastricht (c. 636 – c. 705) – bishop, saint\n* Eric van der Luer (born 1965) – footballer, football manager\n* Pierre Lyonnet (1708–1789) – naturalist, cryptographer, engraver\n* Félix de Mérode (1791–1857) – politician, writer\n* Jan Pieter Minckeleers (1748–1824) – scientist and inventor of coal gas lighting\n* Bram Moszkowicz (born 1960) – ex-barrister\n* Benny Neyman (1951–2008) – singer of popular songs\n* Tom Nijssen (born 1964) – tennis player\n* Jacques Ogg (born 1948) – harpsichordist\n* Henrietta d'Oultremont (1792–1864) – second wife of William I of the Netherlands\n* Jan Peumans (born 1951) – Belgian politician\n* Guido Pieters (born 1948) – film director\n* Dick Raaymakers (1930–2013) – composer, theater maker\n* Prince Rajcomar (born 1985) – football player\n* Louis Regout (1861–1915) – politician\n* André Rieu (born 1949) – violinist, conductor and composer\n* Fred Rompelberg (born 1945) – cyclist, current holder of the World Speed Record Cycling\n* Louis Rutten (1884-1946) – Dutch geologist\n* Henri Sarolea  (1844–1900) – railway entrepreneur and contractor\n* Hubert Soudant (born 1946) – conductor\n* Victor de Stuers (1843–1916) – politician, monument conservationist\n* Jac.

    "aggregatedText" : "Maastricht (;Local pronunciation: Limburgish : Mestreech; French: Maestricht ; Spanish: Mastrique ) is a city and a municipality in the southeast of the Netherlands. It is the capital and largest city of the province of Limburg. Maastricht is located on both sides of the Meuse river (Dutch: Maas), at the point where the Jeker river joins it. It is adjacent to the border with Belgium.\n\nMaastricht developed from a Roman settlement to a Medieval religious centre. In the 16th century it became a garrison town and in the 19th century an early industrial city. Today, the town is a thriving cultural and regional hub. It became well-known through the Maastricht Treaty and as the birthplace of the euro. Maastricht has 1677 national heritage buildings (Rijksmonumenten), the second highest number in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. The town is popular with tourists for shopping and recreation, and has a large international student population. Maastricht is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network and is part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion, which includes nearby German and Belgian cities Aachen, Eupen, Hasselt, Liège and Tongeren. The Meuse-Rhine Euroregion is a metropolis with a population of about 3.9 million with several international universities.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Maastricht is derived from Latin Traiectum ad Mosam (or Traiectum Mosae), meaning 'crossing at the Meuse', and referring to the bridge built by the Romans. The Latin name first appears in medieval documentsAs Treiectinsem urbem, \"the city of Trajectum\", in Gregory of Tours, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gregorytours/gregorytours2.shtml Historia Francorum, 2, 5] (late 6th ct.). M. Gysseling, Toponymisch Woordenboek van België, Nederland, Luxemburg, Noord-Frankrijk en West-Duitsland (vóór 1226) (Tongeren, 1960) [http://bouwstoffen.kantl.be/tw/facsimile/?find=maastricht p. 646]. and it is not known whether this was Maastricht's official name during Roman times. A resident of Maastricht is referred to as Maastrichtenaar whilst in the local dialect it is either Mestreechteneer or, colloquially, Sjeng (derived from the formerly popular French name Jean).\n\nEarly history\n\nNeanderthal remains have been found to the west of Maastricht (Belvédère excavations). Of a later date are Palaeolithic remains, between 8,000 and 25,000 years old. Celts lived here around 500 BC, at a spot where the river Meuse was shallow and therefore easy to cross.\n\nIt is not known when the Romans arrived in Maastricht, or whether the settlement was founded by them. The Romans built a bridge over the Meuse in the 1st century AD, during the reign of Augustus Caesar. The bridge was an important link in the main road between Bavay and Cologne. Roman Maastricht was probably relatively small. Remains of the Roman road, the bridge, a religious shrine, a Roman bath, a granary, some houses and the 4th-century castrum walls and gates, have been excavated. Fragments of provincial Roman sculptures, as well as coins, jewelry, glass, pottery and other objects from Roman Maastricht are on display in the exhibition space of the city's public library (Centre Céramique).\n\nAccording to legend, the Armenian-born Saint Servatius, Bishop of Tongeren, died in Maastricht in 384 and was buried there along the Roman road, outside the castrum. According to Gregory of Tours it was bishop Monulph who, around 570, built the first stone church on the grave of Servatius, the present-day Basilica of Saint Servatius. The city remained an early Christian diocese until it lost this position to nearby Liège in the early 8th century.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nIn the early Middle Ages Maastricht was part of the heartland of the Carolingian Empire along with Aachen and the area around Liège. The town was an important centre for trade and manufacturing. Merovingian coins minted in Maastricht have been found in many places throughout Europe. In the 10th century Maastricht briefly became the capital of the duchy of Lower Lorraine.\n\nDuring the 12th century the town flourished culturally. The provosts of the church of Saint Servatius held important positions in the Holy Roman Empire during this era. The city's two main churches were largely rebuilt and redecorated. Maastricht Romanesque stone sculpture is regarded as one of the highlights of Mosan art. Maastricht painters were praised by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his Parzival. Around the same time, the poet Henric van Veldeke wrote a legend of Saint Servatius, one of the earliest works in Dutch literature.\n\nUnlike most Dutch towns, Maastricht did not receive city rights at a certain date. These developed gradually during its long history. In 1204 the city's dual authority was formalised in a treaty, with the prince-bishops of Liège and the dukes of Brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city. Soon afterwards the first ring of medieval walls were built. In 1275, the old Roman bridge collapsed under the weight of a large procession, killing 400 people; a replacement, the Sint Servaasbrug, was built to the north from 1280 to 1298, funded by church indulgences..\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the city remained a centre for trade and manufacturing of wool and leather but gradually economic decline set in. After a brief period of economic prosperity around 1500, the city's economy suffered during the wars of religion of the 16th and 17th centuries, and recovery did not happen until the industrial revolution in the early 19th century.\n\n16th to 19th centuries\n\nThe important strategic location of Maastricht resulted in the construction of an impressive array of fortifications around the city during this period. The Spanish and Dutch garrisons became an important factor in the city's economy. In 1579 the city was sacked by the Spanish army under general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma (Siege of Maastricht, 1579). For over fifty years the Spanish crown took over the role of the dukes of Brabant in the joint sovereignty over Maastricht. In 1632 the city was conquered by Prince Frederick Henry of Orange and the Dutch States General replaced the Spanish crown in the joint government of Maastricht.\n\nAnother Siege of Maastricht (1673) took place during the Franco-Dutch War. In June 1673, Louis XIV laid siege to the city because French battle supply lines were being threatened. During this siege, Vauban, the famous French military engineer, developed a new strategy in order to break down the strong fortifications surrounding Maastricht. His systematic approach remained the standard method of attacking fortresses until the 20th century. On 25 June 1673, while preparing to storm the city, captain-lieutenant Charles de Batz de Castelmore, also known as the comte d'Artagnan, was killed by a musket shot outside Tongerse Poort. This event was embellished in Alexandre Dumas' novel The Vicomte de Bragelonne, part of the D'Artagnan Romances. French troops occupied Maastricht from 1673 to 1678.\n\nIn 1748 the French again conquered the city at what is known as the Second French Siege of Maastricht, during the War of Austrian Succession. The French took the city for the last time in 1794, when the condominium was dissolved and Maastricht was annexed to the First French Empire (1794–1814). For twenty years Maastricht was the capital of the French département of Meuse-Inférieure.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic era, Maastricht became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. It was made the capital of the newly formed Province of Limburg (1815–1839). When the southern provinces of the newly formed kingdom seceded in 1830, the Dutch garrison in Maastricht remained loyal to the Dutch king, William I, even when most of the inhabitants of the town and the surrounding area sided with the Belgian revolutionaries. In 1831, arbitration by the Great Powers allocated the city to the Netherlands. However, neither the Dutch nor the Belgians agreed to this and the arrangement was not implemented until the 1839 Treaty of London. During this period of isolation Maastricht developed into an early industrial town.\n\nBecause of its eccentric location in the southeastern Netherlands, and its geographical and cultural proximity to Belgium and Germany, integration of Maastricht and Limburg into the Netherlands did not come about easily. Maastricht retained a distinctly non-Dutch appearance during much of the 19th century and it was not until the First World War that the city was forced to look northwards.\n\n20th century and onwards\n\nEarly in World War II, the city was taken by the Germans during the Battle of Maastricht in May 1940. On 13 and 14 September 1944 it was the first Dutch city to be liberated by Allied forces. The three Meuse bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the war. As elsewhere in the Netherlands, the majority of Maastricht Jews died in Nazi concentration camps.About 77% of Maastricht's relatively small Jewish community of 505 members did not survive the war.  (2005): Historische Encyclopedie Maastricht, pp. 256-257. Walburg Pers, Zutphen. .\n\nDuring the latter half of the century, traditional industries (such as the famous Maastricht potteries) declined and the city shifted to a service economy. Maastricht University was founded in 1976. Several European institutions have found their base in Maastricht. In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated and signed here, leading to the creation of the European Union and the euro.Gnesotto, N. (1992). European union after Minsk and Maastricht. International Affairs. 68(2), 223-232.\n\nIn recent years, under mayor Gerd Leers, Maastricht launched a campaign against drug-related problems. Leers instigated a controversial plan to relocate some of the cannabis coffee shops—where the purchase of soft drugs in limited quantities is tolerated—from the city centre to the outskirts, in an attempt to stop foreign buyers from causing trouble in the downtown area. Although the so-called \"coffee corner plan\" has not been entirely abandoned, the new mayor Onno Hoes has given priority to the Dutch government's approach of limiting entrance to 'coffee shops' to Dutch adults only, and to tackle the problem of drug runners in cooperation with the city of Rotterdam (where the majority of drug runners are from).\n\nLarge parts of the city centre have been redeveloped, including the area around the main railway station, the main shopping streets, the Entre Deux and Mosae Forum shopping centres, and the Maasboulevard promenade along the Meuse. Also, a new quarter, including the new Bonnefanten Museum, a public library, a theatre and several housing blocks designed by international architects, was built on the grounds of the former Céramique potteries near the town centre. As a result, Maastricht looks notably smarter. Further large-scale projects, such as the redevelopment of the Sphinx and Belvédère areas, are underway.\n\nGeography\n\nNeighbourhoods\n\nMaastricht consists of five districts (stadsdelen) and 44 neighbourhoods (wijken). Each neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its postal code.\n\n# Maastricht Centrum (Binnenstad, Jekerkwartier, Kommelkwartier, Statenkwartier, Boschstraatkwartier, Sint Maartenspoort, Wyck-Céramique)\n# South-West (Villapark, Jekerdal, Biesland, Campagne, Wolder, Sint Pieter)\n# North-West (Brusselsepoort, Mariaberg, Belfort, Pottenberg, Malpertuis, Caberg, Malberg, Dousberg-Hazendans, Daalhof, Boschpoort, Bosscherveld, Frontenkwartier, Belvédère, Lanakerveld)\n# North-East (Beatrixhaven, Borgharen, Itteren, Meerssenhoven, Wyckerpoort, Wittevrouwenveld, Nazareth, Limmel, Amby)\n# South-East (Randwyck, Heugem, Heugemerveld, Scharn, Heer, De Heeg, Vroendaal)\n\nThe neighbourhoods of Itteren, Borgharen, Limmel, Amby, Heer, Heugem, Scharn, Oud-Caberg, Sint Pieter and Wolder all used to be separate municipalities or villages until they were annexed by the city of Maastricht in the course of the 20th century.\n\nNeighbouring villages\n\nThe outlying areas of the following villages are bordering the municipality of Maastricht directly, which means among others that in many a case a considerable number of their inhabitants originate from Maastricht.\n\nClockwise from north to northwest:\n\n*Neerharen (B), \n*Bunde, \n*Meerssen, \n*Berg en Terblijt, \n*Bemelen, \n*Cadier en Keer, \n*Gronsveld,\n*Oost, \n*Ternaaien (B), \n*Kanne (B), \n*Vroenhoven (B), \n*Kesselt (B), \n*Veldwezelt (B), \n*Petit Lanaye (B),\n*Lanaken (B).\n\n(B = Situated in Belgium)\n\nBorder\n\nMaastricht's city limits has an international border with Belgium. Most of it borders Belgium's Flemish region, but a small part to the south also has a border with the Walloon region. Both countries are part of Europe's Schengen Area thus are open without border controls.\n\nClimate\n\nMaastricht features the same climate as most of the Netherlands (Cfb, Oceanic climate), however, due to its more inland location in between hills, summers tend to be warmer (especially in the Meuse valley, which lies 70 metres lower than the meteorological station) and winters a bit colder, although the difference is only remarkable at a few days a year. The second highest temperature in the Netherlands, and the highest temperature of a still existing station was recorded on 2 July 2015 at .\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population\n\nInhabitants by nationality\n\nInhabitants by country of birth\n\nLanguages\n\nMaastricht is a city of linguistic diversity, partly as a result of its location at the crossroads of multiple language areas and its international student population.\n\n* Dutch is the national language and the language of elementary and secondary education (excluding international institutions) as well as administration. Dutch in Maastricht is often spoken with a distinctive Limburgish accent, which should not be confused with the Limburgish language.\n* Limburgish (or Limburgian) is the overlapping term of the tonal dialects spoken in the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg. The Maastrichtian dialect (Mestreechs) is only one of many variants of Limburgish. It is characterised by stretched vowels and some French influence on its vocabulary. In recent years the Maastricht dialect has been in decline (see dialect levelling) and a language switch to Standard Dutch has been noted.\n* French used to be the language of education in Maastricht. In the 18th century the language occupied a powerful position as judicial and cultural language, and it was used throughout the following century by the upper classes.  Between 1851 and 1892 a Francophone newspaper (Le Courrier de la Meuse) was published in Maastricht. The language is often part of secondary school curricula. Many proper names and some street names are French and the language has left many traces in the local dialect.\n* German, like French, is often part of secondary school curricula. Due to Maastricht's geographic proximity to Germany and the great number of German students in the city, German is widely spoken.\n* English has become an important language in education. At Maastricht University and Hogeschool Zuyd it is the language of instruction for many courses. Many foreign students and expatriates use English as a lingua franca. English is also a mandatory subject in Dutch elementary and secondary schools.\n\nReligion\n\nThe largest religion in Maastricht is Christianity with 65.1% of the population that is Christian, of whom 92.31% is Catholic.\n\nEconomy\n\nPrivate companies based in Maastricht\n\n* ENCI – First Dutch Cement Industry\n* Sappi – South African Pulp and Paper Industry\n* Mosa – ceramic tiles\n* BASF – previously Ten Horn, pigments\n* Hewlett-Packard – previously Indigo, manufacturer of electronic data systems\n* Vodafone – mobile phone company\n* DHL – international express mail services\n* Teleperformance – contact center services\n* Mercedes-Benz – customer contact centre for Europe\n* VGZ – health insurance, customer contact centre\n* Esaote (former Pie Medical Equipment) – manufacturer of medical and veterinary diagnostic equipment\n* Pie Medical Imaging – cardiovascular quantitative analysis software\n* CardioTek – manufacturer of medical equipment for Cardiac electrophysiology procedures\n* BioPartner Centre Maastricht – life sciences spin-off companies\n\nPublic institutions\n\nSince the 1980s a number of European and international institutions have made Maastricht their base.

Other extensions of the park are called Kempland, Henri Hermanspark, Monseigneur Nolenspark and Waldeckpark. From 2014 onwards, the grounds of the former Tapijn military barracks will be gradually added to the park;\n* Jekerpark, a new park along the river Jeker, separated from Stadspark by a busy road;\n* Frontenpark, a new park west of the city centre, incorporating parts of the fortifications of Maastricht from the 17th to 19th centuries;\n* Charles Eykpark, a modern park between the public library and Bonnefanten Museum on the east bank of the Meuse river, designed in the late 1990s by Swedish landscape architect Gunnar Martinsson.\n* Griendpark, a modern park on the east bank of the river with an inline-skating and skateboarding course.\n* Geusseltpark in eastern Maastricht and J.J. van de Vennepark in western Maastricht, both with elaborate sports facilities.\n\nNatural areas\n\n* The Meuse river and its green banks in outlying areas. In the northern areas around Itteren and Borgharen 'new nature' is being created in combination with river protection measures and gravel mining.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Meuse_River_in_Maastricht Commons images Meuse_River_in_Maastricht]\n* Pietersplas, an artificial lake between Maastricht and Gronsveld that was the result of gravel pits on the banks of the Meuse river. There is a beach on the northern slope of the lake and a marina near Castle Hoogenweerth. The eastern riverbed between Pietersplas and the provincial government building is a nature reserve (Kleine Weerd).\n* The Jeker Valley, along the river Jeker, starts near the city centre in Stadspark and leads via Jekerpark to an area with green meadows, fertile fields, some vineyards on the slopes of Cannerberg, several water mills and Château Neercanne, and continues further south into Belgium.\n* The green flanks of Mount Saint Peter, including many footpaths.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sint_Pietersberg Commons images Mount Saint Peter] \n* Dousberg and Zouwdal, a modest hill and valley surrounded by urban development on the western edge of the city, partly in Belgium. A large part of the hill is now in use as an international golf course (Golfclub Maastricht).[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dousberg Commons images Dousberg]\n* Landgoederenzone, an extended area in the northeast of Maastricht (partly in Meerssen) consisting of around fifteen country estates, such as Severen, Geusselt, Bethlehem, Mariënwaard, Kruisdonk, Vaeshartelt, Meerssenhoven, Borgharen and Hartelstein. Some of the castles, villas and stately homes are surrounded by industrial areas or quarries.\n* Picturesque bike paths through agricultural areas in several outlying quarters (like \"Biesland\" and \"Wolder\").\n\nSports\n\n* In football, Maastricht is represented by MVV Maastricht (Dutch: Maatschappelijke Voetbal Vereniging Maastricht), who (as of the 2016–2017 season) play in the Dutch first division of the national competition (which is the second league after the Eredivisie league).

Tom Dumoulin was born in Maastricht.\n* Since 2000, Maastricht has been the first city in the Netherland with a lacrosse team. The Student Sport Association \"Maaslax\" is closely linked to Maastricht University and member of the NLB (Nederland Lacrosse Bond).\n\nPolitics\n\nCity council\n\nThe municipal government of Maastricht consists of a city council, a mayor and a number of aldermen. The city council, a 39-member legislative body directly elected for four years, appoints the aldermen on the basis of a coalition agreement between two or more parties after each election. The 2006 municipal elections in the Netherlands were, as often, dominated by national politics and led to a shift from right to left throughout the country. In Maastricht, the traditional broad governing coalition of Christian Democrats (CDA), Labour (PvdA), Greens (GreenLeft) and Liberals (VVD) was replaced by a centre-left coalition of Labour, Christian Democrats and Greens. Two Labour aldermen were appointed, along with one Christian Democrat and one Green alderman. Due to internal disagreements, one of the VVD council members left the party in 2005 and formed a new liberal group in 2006 (Liberalen Maastricht). The other opposition parties in the current city council are the Socialist Party (SP), the Democrats (D66) and two local parties (Stadsbelangen Mestreech (SBM) and the Seniorenpartij).\n\nAldermen and mayors\n\nThe aldermen and the mayor make up the executive branch of the municipal government. After the popular previous mayor, Gerd Leers (CDA), decided to step down in January 2010 following the 'Bulgarian Villa' affair, an affair concerning a holiday villa project in Byala, Bulgaria, in which the mayor was alleged to have been involved in shady deals to raise the value of villas he had ownership of. Up until July 1, 2015 the mayor of Maastricht was Onno Hoes, a Liberal (VVD), the only male mayor in the country, who officially was married to a male person. In 2013 Hoes was the subject of some political commotion, after facts had been disclosed about intimate affairs with several other male persons. The affair had no consequences for his political career.[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22152141/__Onno_Hoes_mag_blijven__.html Article in a Dutch paper about the political impact of mayor Onno Hoes' personal demeanour.] Because of a new affair in 2014 Hoes eventually stepped down.Grindstad, Ingrid. [http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/12/10/maastricht-mayor-hoes-resigns-amidst-sex-smear-campaign/ \"Maastricht mayor Hoes resigns amidst sex smear campaign\"], NL Times, Amsterdam, 10 December 2014. Retrieved on 10 December 2014.\n\nSince July 1, 2015 the current mayor of Maastricht has been Annemarie Penn-te Strake.[http://www.1limburg.nl/annemarie-penn-geinstalleerd-als-burgemeester-maastricht Article about the installment of Penn as mayor] Penn is independent and serves no political party, although her husband is a former chairman of the Maastricht Seniorenpartij.[http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4036864/annemarie-penn-nieuwe-burgemeester-maastricht.html Article with details about her political career] She has served for the Dutch judicial system for many years in many different positions. During her tenure as mayor she still serves as attorney general.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075229/https://www.om.nl/organisatie/procureurs-generaal/mr-penn-strake/ Penn's history in the Dutch judicial system]\n\nCannabis\n\nOne controversial issue which has dominated Maastricht politics for many years and which has also affected national and international politics, is the city's approach to soft drugs. Under the pragmatic Dutch soft drug policy, a policy of non-enforcement, individuals may buy and use cannabis from 'coffeeshops' (cannabis bars) under certain conditions. Maastricht, like many other border towns, has seen a growing influx of 'drug tourists', mainly young people from Belgium, France and Germany, who provide a large amount of revenue for the coffeeshops (around 13) in the city centre. The city government, most notably ex-mayor Leers, have been actively promoting drug policy reform in order to deal with its negative side effects.\n\nOne of the proposals, known as the 'Coffee Corner Plan', proposed by then-mayor Leers and supported unanimously by the city council in 2008, was to relocate the coffeeshops from the city centre to the outskirts of the town (in some cases near the national Dutch-Belgian border).[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/world/europe/20dutch.html?scp4&sq\nmaastricht%20drugs&st=cse Cannabis Cafes Get Nudge to Fringes of a Dutch City], The New York Times, 20 August 2006. The purpose of this plan was to reduce the impact of drug tourism on the city centre, such as parking problems and the illegal sale of hard drugs in the vicinity of the coffeeshops, and to monitor the sale and use of cannabis more closely in areas away from the crowded city centre. The Coffee Corner Plan, however, has met with fierce opposition from neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and from members of the Dutch and Belgian parliament. The plan has been the subject of various legal challenges and has not been carried out up to this date (2014).\n\nOn 16 December 2010, the Court of Justice of the European Union upheld a local Maastricht ban on the sale of cannabis to foreign tourists, restricting entrance to coffee shops to residents of Maastricht. The ban did not affect scientific or medical usage. In 2011, the Dutch government introduced a similar national system, the wietpas (\"cannabis pass\"), restricting access to Dutch coffeeshops to residents of the Netherlands. After protests from local mayors about the difficulty of implementing the issuing of wietpasses, Dutch parliament in 2012 agreed to replace the pass by any proof of residency. The new system has led to a slight reduction in drug tourism to cannabis shops in Maastricht but at the same time to an increase of drug dealing on the street.\n\nTransport\n\nBy car\n\nMaastricht is served by the A2 and A79 motorways. The city can be reached from Brussels and Cologne in approximately one hour and from Amsterdam in about two and a half hours.\n\nThe A2 motorway that runs through Maastricht in a double decked tunnel. Before 2016 the A2 motorway ran through the city and was heavily congested and caused air pollution in the urban area. Construction of a two-level tunnel designed to solve these problems started in 2011 and was opened (in stages) by December 2016.[http://www.a2maastricht.nl/page.aspx?id=334 A2maastricht.nl]\n\nIn spite of several large underground car parks, parking in the city centre forms a major problem during weekends and bank holidays due to the large numbers of visitors. Parking fees are high in order to incite visitors to use public transport or park and ride facilities away from the centre.\n\nBy train\n\nMaastricht is served by three rail operators, all of which call at the main Maastricht railway station near the centre and the smaller Maastricht Randwyck, located near the business and university district, and Maastricht Noord, which opened in 2013. Intercity trains northwards to Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Den Bosch and Utrecht are operated by Dutch Railways. The National Railway Company of Belgium runs south to Liège in Belgium. The line to Heerlen, Valkenburg and Kerkrade is operated by Arriva. The former railway to Aachen was closed down in the 1980s. A small section of the old westbound railway to Hasselt (Belgium) was restored in recent years and will be used as a modern tramline, scheduled to open in 2023.\n\nBy tram\n\nThe Dutch and Flanders governments have reached an agreement in 2014 to build a new tram route called Spartacus. It is scheduled to take three years, from 2015 to 2018, and cost €283 million. When it is completed, Spartacus will carry passengers from Maastricht city centre to Hasselt city centre, the capital of Flanders’ Limburg province, in 30 minutes. It will be operated by the transport company De Lijn, with 3 scheduled stops in Maastricht and further 10 in Flanders.\n\nBy bus\n\nRegular bus lines connect the city centre, outer areas, business districts and railway stations. The regional Veolia bus network extends to most parts of South Limburg as well as to Hasselt, Tongeren, Maasmechelen and Liège in Belgium, and Aachen in Germany.\n\nBy air\n\nMaastricht is served by the nearby Maastricht Aachen Airport  – located in nearby Beek and informally referred to by that name. The airport is served by Corendon Dutch Airlines and Ryanair.
