A stronger condition on a set of integers is pairwise coprime, which means that  and  are coprime for every pair  of different integers in the set. The set } is coprime, but it is not pairwise coprime since 2 and 4 are not relatively prime.\n\nProperties \n\nThe numbers 1 and −1 are the only integers coprime to every integer, and they are the only integers that are coprime with 0.\n\nA number of conditions are equivalent to  and  being coprime:\n*No prime number divides both  and .\n*There exist integers  and  such that  (see Bézout's identity).\n*The integer  has a multiplicative inverse modulo , meaning that there exists an integer  such that . In ring-theoretic language,  is a unit in the ring  of integers modulo .\n*Every pair of congruence relations for an unknown integer , of the form  and , has a solution (Chinese remainder theorem); in fact the solutions are described by a single congruence relation modulo .\n*The least common multiple of  and  is equal to their product , i.e. .\n\nAs a consequence of the third point, if a and b are coprime and br ≡ bs (mod a), then r ≡ s (mod a). That is, we may \"divide by b\" when working modulo a. Furthermore, if b1 and b2 are both coprime with a, then so is their product b1b2 (i.e., modulo a it is a product of invertible elements, and therefore invertible); this also follows from the first point by Euclid's lemma, which states that if a prime number p divides a product bc, then p divides at least one of the factors b, c.\n\nAs a consequence of the first point, if a and b are coprime, then so are any powers ak and bm.\n\nIf a and b are coprime and a divides the product bc, then a divides c. This can be viewed as a generalization of Euclid's lemma.\n\nThe two integers a and b are coprime if and only if the point with coordinates (a, b) in a Cartesian coordinate system is \"visible\" from the origin (0,0), in the sense that there is no point with integer coordinates on the line segment  between the origin and (a, b). (See figure 1.)\n\nIn a sense that can be made precise, the probability that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/π2 (see pi), which is about 61%. See below.\n\nTwo natural numbers a and b are coprime if and only if the numbers 2a − 1 and 2b − 1 are coprime. As a generalization of this, following easily from the Euclidean algorithm in base n > 1:\n\n\\gcd\\left(n^a - 1, n^b - 1\\right) = n^{\\gcd(a, b)} - 1.\n\nCoprimality in sets \n\nA set of integers S = {a1, a2, .... an} can also be called coprime or setwise coprime if the greatest common divisor of all the elements of the set is 1.  For example, the integers 6, 10, 15 are coprime because 1 is the only positive integer that divides all of them.\n\nIf every pair in a set of integers is coprime, then the set is said to be pairwise coprime (or pairwise relatively prime, mutually coprime or mutually relatively prime). Pairwise coprimality is a stronger condition than setwise coprimality; every pairwise coprime finite set is also setwise coprime, but the reverse is not true. For example, the integers 4, 5, 6 are (setwise) coprime (because the only positive integer dividing all of them is 1), but they are not pairwise coprime (because gcd(4, 6) = 2).\n\nThe concept of pairwise coprimality is important as a hypothesis in many results in number theory, such as the Chinese remainder theorem.\n\nIt is possible for an infinite set of integers to be pairwise coprime.  Notable examples include the set of all prime numbers, the set of elements in Sylvester's sequence, and the set of all Fermat numbers.\n\nCoprimality in ring ideals \n\nTwo ideals A and B in the commutative ring R are called coprime (or comaximal) if A + B R. This generalizes Bézout's identity: with this definition, two principal ideals (a) and (b) in the ring of integers Z are coprime if and only if a and b are coprime. If the ideals A and B of R are coprime, then AB \n A∩B; furthermore, if C is a third ideal such that A contains BC, then A contains C. The Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to any commutative ring, using coprime ideals.\n\nProbability of Coprimality \n\nGiven two randomly chosen integers a and b, it is reasonable to ask how likely it is that a and b are coprime. In this determination, it is convenient to use the characterization that a and b are coprime if and only if no prime number divides both of them (see Fundamental theorem of arithmetic).\n\nInformally, the probability that any number is divisible by a prime (or in fact any integer) p is 1/p; for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7. Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by p is 1/p^2, and the probability that at least one of them is not is 1-1/p^2.  Any finite collection of divisibility events associated to distinct primes is mutually independent.  For example, in the case of two events, a number is divisible by primes p and q if and only if it is divisible by pq; the latter event has probability 1/pq.  If one makes the heuristic assumption that such reasoning can be extended to infinitely many divisibility events, one is led to guess that the probability that two numbers are coprime is given by a product over all primes,\n\n\\prod_{\\text{prime } p} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{p^2}\\right) \\left( \\prod_{\\text{prime } p} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-2}} \\right)^{-1} \n \\frac{1}{\\zeta(2)} = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2} \\approx 0.607927102 \\approx 61\\%.\n\nHere ζ refers to the Riemann zeta function, the identity relating the product over primes to ζ(2) is an example of an Euler product, and the evaluation of ζ(2) as π2/6 is the Basel problem, solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735.\n\nThere is no way to choose a positive integer at random so that each positive integer occurs with equal probability, but statements about \"randomly chosen integers\" such as the ones above can be formalized by using the notion of natural density.  For each positive integer N, let PN be the probability that two randomly chosen numbers in \\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\} are coprime.

For a proof, see  one can show that in the limit as N \\to \\infty, the probability P_N approaches 6/\\pi^2.\n\nMore generally, the probability of k randomly chosen integers being coprime is 1/{\\zeta(k)}.\n\nGenerating all coprime pairs\n\nAll pairs of positive coprime numbers (m, n) (with m > n) can be arranged in two disjoint complete ternary trees, one tree starting from (2,1) (for even-odd and odd-even pairs),. and the other tree starting from (3,1) (for odd-odd pairs).. The children of each vertex (m,n) are generated as follows:\n*Branch 1: (2m-n,m)\n*Branch 2: (2m+n,m)\n*Branch 3: (m+2n,n)\n\nThis scheme is exhaustive and non-redundant with no invalid members.",
