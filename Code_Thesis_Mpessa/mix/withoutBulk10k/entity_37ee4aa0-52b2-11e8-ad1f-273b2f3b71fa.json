Led by dictator Hastings Banda, Malawi was the only African country to maintain close relations with White-ruled South Africa until the 1994 election of Nelson Mandela. Malawians were viewed as important workers in the South African mines due to their \"skills, work discipline and lack of militancy\"[http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/386/53?ck\nnck Aliens and AIDS in Southern Africa: The Malawi-South  Africa debate] by Wiseman Chijere Chirwa, in African Affairs, 97:53-79 (1998) From 1988 to 1992, around 13,000 Malawian migrant laborers were forcefully repatriated out of South Africa. Officially, this was because 200 Malawians had tested positive for HIV in the previous two years, but many believe that it was due the need for retrenchment of laborers during a crisis in South Africa's mining industry.\n\nSince South Africa and Malawi had their first democratic elections in 1994, Malawi and South Africa have enhanced relations.

Since the expulsion the UK has suspended direct government aid, citing concerns over governance and human rights.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy significantly strengthened the already cordial U.S. relationship with Malawi. Significant numbers of Malawians study in the United States. The United States has an active Peace Corps program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, and an Agency for International Development (USAID) mission in Malawi.\n\nIn July 2011, the United States suspended direct funding.
