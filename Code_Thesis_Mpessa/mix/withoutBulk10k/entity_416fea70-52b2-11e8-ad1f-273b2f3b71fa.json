  "textBody" : "The Mazda MX-5, released as the Mazda MX-5 Miata in North America and as the Eunos Roadster or Mazda Roadster in Japan, is a lightweight two-seater roadster with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan, the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. The MX-5 was conceived as a small roadster – with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements, while being technologically modern and reliable. The MX-5 is conceptually the evolution and spiritual successor of the British sports cars of the 1950s & '60s, such as the Triumph Spitfire, Austin-Healey 100, MG MGA, and particularly the Lotus Elan.\n\nThe second generation MX-5 (NB) was launched in 1998 (for the 1999 model year), the third generation (NC) model was launched in 2005 (for the 2006 model year), and a fourth generation (ND) was released in 2015 (for the 2016 model year). It continues to be the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history and by April 2016, over one million MX-5s had been built and sold around the world.\nProduction of the MX-5 had fallen by 2013 to below 14,000 units, due to the world finance crisis in 2008, and the pre-announcement in 2012 of the coming ND model.\n\nSince the launch of the third generation, Mazda has consolidated worldwide marketing using the MX-5 name with the exception of the United States where it is marketed as the MX-5 Miata, and Japan, where it is known as the Roadster. The name \"miata\" derives from Old High German for \"reward\".\n\nGenerations and overview\n\nThe MX-5's first generation, the NA, sold over 400,000 units from May 1989 to 1997 – with a  straight-4 engine to 1993, a  engine thereafter (with a de-tuned 1.6 as a budget option in some markets) – recognizable by its pop-up headlights. The second generation (NB) was introduced in 1999 with a slight increase in engine power; it can be recognized by the fixed headlights and the glass rear window, although first generation owners may opt for the glass window design when replacing the original top. The third generation (NC) was introduced in 2006 with a  engine.\n\nLaunched at a time when production of small roadsters had almost come to an end, the Alfa Romeo Spider was the only comparable volume model in production at the time of the MX-5's launch. Just a decade earlier, a host of similar models — notably the MG B, Triumph TR7, Triumph Spitfire, and Fiat Spider — had been available.\n\nThe body is a conventional, but light, unibody or monocoque construction, with (detachable) front and rear subframes. The MX-5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential, minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling. Some MX-5s feature limited slip differentials and anti-lock braking system. Traction control is an option available on NC models. All models weighed approximately one tonne.\n\nWith an approximate 50:50 front/rear weight balance, the car has nearly neutral handling. Inducing oversteer is easy and very controllable, thus making the MX-5 a popular choice for amateur and stock racing, including, in the US, the Sports Car Club of America's Solo2 autocross and Spec Miata race series, and in the UK, the [http://www.5clubracing.co.uk 5Club Racing] championship. Raddatz and Otten won the AASA Australian Endurance Championship in 2011.\n\nThe MX-5 has won awards including Wheels Magazine 's Car of the Year for 1989, 2005 and 2016; Sports Car Internationals \"best sports car of the 1990s\" and \"ten best sports cars of all time\"; 2005–2006 Car of the Year Japan; and 2005 Australian Car of the Year. The Miata has also made Car and Driver magazine's annual Ten Best list 14 times. In their December 2009 issue, Grassroots Motorsports magazine named the Miata as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years.\n\nIn 2009, English automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson wrote: \n\nDesign genesis\n\nIn 1976, Bob Hall, a journalist at Motor Trend magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language, met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai, head of Research and Development at Mazda. Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future:\n\nIn 1981, Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto, now chairman of Mazda Motors, who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go-ahead to research the idea further. At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California. There, Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image, proportion and visualization of the \"light-weight sports\" concept. In 1983, the idea turned concept was approved under the \"Offline 55\" program, an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed. Thus, under head of project Masakatsu, the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California.\n\nThe Californian team proposed a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, codenamed Duo 101, in line with the British roadster ancestry, but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout or the rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.\n\nThe first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984, with designs presented on paper only. The mid-engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities, although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) requirements of the project. It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984, when full-scale clay models were presented, that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX-5.\n\nThe Duo 101, so named as either a soft top or hardtop could be used, incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan, a 1960s roadster, including the door handles and grille opening. International Automotive Design (IAD) in Worthing, England was commissioned to develop a running prototype, codenamed V705. It was built with a fiberglass body, a  engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models. The V705 was completed in August 1985 and taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara, California and got positive reactions.\n\nThe project received final approval on 18 January 1986. The model's codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase, under head of program Toshihiko Hirai. The task of constructing five engineering mules (more developed prototypes) was again allocated to IAD, which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729. While Tom Matano, Mark Jordan, Wu Huang Chin, Norman Garrett, and Koichi Hayashi worked on the final design, the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details.\n\nBy 1989, with a definitive model name now chosen, the MX-5 was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car, weighing just 940 kg.\n\nAlthough Mazda's concept was for the MX-5 to be an inexpensive sports car, at introduction the design met strong demand, with many dealers placing customers on pre-order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup.\n\nJinba ittai\n\nMazda used a design credo across the four generations of the MX-5's development: the phrase , which translates loosely into English as \"rider (jin) and horse (ba) as one body (ittai)\".\n\nWith the first generation of the MX-5, the phrase was developed into five specific core design requirements:\n* That the car would be as compact and as light as possible while meeting global safety requirements.\n* That the cockpit would comfortably accommodate two full-stature occupants with no wasted space.\n* That the basic layout would continue with the original's front-midship rear-drive configuration with the engine positioned ahead of the driver but behind the front axle for 50:50 weight distribution.\n* That all four wheels would be attached by wishbone or multi-link suspension systems to maximize tire performance, road grip, and dynamic stability.\n* And that a power-plant frame would again provide a solid connection between the engine and rear-mounted differential to sharpen throttle response.\n\n First generation (NA) \n\nThe MX-5 was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show on February 10, 1989, with a price tag of . The MX-5, with production code NA, was made available for delivery to buyers worldwide in the following dates: May 1989 (as a 1990 model) in the US and Canada; September 1, 1989 in Japan; and 1990 in Europe. An optional hardtop was made available at the same time, in sheet moulding compound (SMC). Demand initially outstripped production, fueled by enthusiastic press reviews.\n\nIn Japan, the car was not badged as a Mazda, as the company was experimenting with the creation of different marques for deluxe models, similar to Nissan's Infiniti, Honda's Acura and Toyota's Lexus. Instead, the Mazda MX-5 was sold as the Eunos Roadster in Japan, and was joined by the MX-3/AZ-3/Eunos Presso (based on Japanese Mazda dealerships). The exterior dimensions were also in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the two engines provided Japanese buyers a choice that obligated an affordable road tax option.\n\nThe body shell of the NA was all-steel with a light-weight aluminium hood. Overall dimensions were 3970 mm in length, 1675 mm in width, and 1235 mm in height. Without options, the NA weighed only 2150 lb. It had a . Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels, with an anti-roll bar at the front and rear. Four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated at the front, were behind alloy wheels with 185/60HR14 radial tires. The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then-current 323/Protege.\n\nThe original MX-5 came with a  dual overhead cam inline four-cylinder engine, producing 86 kW at 6500 rpm, and 136 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm. The engine employs an electronic fuel injection system using a vane-type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a camshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor. This engine, codename B6ZE(RS), was specifically designed for the MX-5 and featured a lightened crankshaft, flywheel, and aluminum sump with cooling fins.\n\nThe standard transmission was a five-speed manual, a unit derived from the one used in the Mazda 929/Luce (also rear-wheel drive). The gear shift was the subject of close attention during development, with engineers told to make it shift in as small a gear pattern as possible and with minimal effort.Garrett, p. 10 In Japan and the US, an optional automatic transmission was also offered but proved to be unpopular. The Japanese and American markets also received an optional viscous limited slip rear differential, although it was only available for cars with a manual transmission. To achieve the low introductory price, the base model was stripped. It had steel wheels, manual steering, roll-up windows, and no stereo or air-conditioning. Power steering, air-conditioning, and stereo were added as standard equipment in later years.\n\n These have a numbered brass plaque on the dash above the glovebox and on the front of the Owners Book, and are fitted with alloy wheels from MSW (Mazda Sports Workshop) which are often mistaken for BBS's, but which are entirely unique to this model.\n\n1500 LE (Limited Edition) cars were produced in 1993. This model featured red leather interior, upgraded stereo, Nardi shift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise, limited slip differential, power windows, power mirrors, power steering, air conditioning, BBS wheels, Bilstein shocks, front and rear spoilers, ABS brakes, stainless sill plates, and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim. All 1993 LE cars came in black.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, the first-generation MX-5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful  BP-ZE engine, dual airbags and a limited slip differential in some markets. The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side-impact standards, most visibly by adding a \"track bar\" between the seatbelt towers inside the car, but also to the front and rear subframes. Also, 1994 and 1995 were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint (Laguna Blue Mica), making these cars rare collectors cars to some. 1994 also saw the introduction of the \"R\" package, a sport-themed package with Bilstein shocks and subtle underbody spoilers, in addition to the removal of unnecessary items such as power steering. No body style changes were made, however.\n\nThe new  engine produced 98 kW, which was then increased to 99 kW for the 1996 model year. The base weight increased to 990 kg. Performance was thus improved slightly, because the additional weight was partly offset by the extra power. In some markets such as Europe, the  engine continued to be available as a lower-cost option, but was detuned to 66 kW. This lower-powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new . Japanese and US cars were fitted with an optional Torsen LSD, which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential.\n\nThere were a number of trim levels and special editions available, determined by local Mazda marketing departments. In the US, the base model was offered for US$13,995 at launch and was very basic, with manual windows, steel wheels, and without A/C or power steering. The \"A Package\" offered power steering, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo. The \"B Package\" added power windows, along with cruise control and headrest speakers, while the \"C Package\" included a tan interior and top and leather seats. The \"R Package\" was for racing, and the annual special editions were formalized as \"M Editions\". These included all of the luxury options from the \"C Package\" as well as special paint and, sometimes, special wheels. In the UK, to celebrate Mazda's 24 hours of Le Mans win, Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX-5, with the winner's color scheme (see Mazda 787B) and came equipped with BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX-5s.\n\nThe first generation MX-5 was phased out after the 1997 model year (with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA), with the final 1500 NAs produced for the US market being the \"STO\" (\"Special Touring Option\") versions.\n\nM2 special editions\n\nA small range of Miata units were assembled by the M2 Incorporated. Founded in November 1991, M2, also known as \"Mazda Too\", was Mazda's new off-line planning / niche-house / Research & Development company back in the early '90s. The M2 Corp. employees had noble intentions — creating niche-mobiles derived from Mazda's volume products. Although M2's basic mission involved focusing on the \"soft\" aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants, the changes to the off-line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics.\n\nHeading the M2 operation was Mr. Masakatsu Kato, original father of the Miata (Eunos Roadster) in Japan, as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles. Kato-san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana, development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the FC (second-generation RX-7) and the NA Roadster (Miata MX-5). M2 Corp. was based out of Tokyo, Japan. M2-Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda, and it was closed by Mazda in 1995. Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles, and then in the late '90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo. There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995, beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer (Dec-91).\n\nM2-1001 Cafe Roadster (Dec-91) Limited 1/300\nM2 Corp. released the M2-1001 Roadster in December 1991. It was a special \"Limited Production\" Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units, in a special Blue/Black Mica Paint, with a sticker price of $26,000. Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2's Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster.\n\nThis upscale Eunos Roadster was M2's first turn-key, race-ready offering. A list of popular features, while not exhaustive, is as follows: functional front airdam with integrated fog lamps, vintage aero mirrors, 4-point roll bar, vintage gauge cluster, fixed back bucket seats, polished 3-spoke steering wheel, stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates, polished aluminum strut brace, upgraded exhaust by HKS, intake system, 1.6L motor with new aggressive pistons, upgraded camshaft, lightweight flywheel, LSD cooling intake, manual steering, manual windows (A/C was optional), racing pedals, centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel, aluminum gas filler cap, a more aggressive wheel & tire package (15\" x 6\" Panasport rims), and a rear spoiler (which became standard for the R package). The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to 132 bhp @ 7,000 rpm, and 109 lbf.ft of torque @ 5,500 rpm. Once released, it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35,000 for one.\n\nM2-1002 Vintage Roadster (Nov-92) Limited 1/300\nM2-CORP released its second Roadster in late 1992, with a slightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster. This one did not do as well as the 1001.\n\nM2-1028 Street Competition Roadster (Feb-94) Limited 1/300\nM2-CORP released its third Roadster in early 1994, based on the original \"Jinba Ittai\" concept made by Toshihiko Hirai. This was billed as a track-ready Roadster. (The US saw a cheaper version known as the R-Package.) Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only, this Roadster used the new 1.8L powerplant with upgraded pistons, camshafts, and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002. This Roadster had an output of close to 150 bhp, and included 14\" Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip. The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors, MOMO Steering Wheel, Centerless console, racing seats, racing tow hook,  a set of lower lip spoilers (R-Package), and a newly designed \"Duck-Tail\" trunk lid with integrated spoiler. The M2-1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only , a very light weight from the original lid of . It also came with a 6-point roll cage, but no soft-top, instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage. With optional FRP Hardtop with plexiglass rear window for more weight savings coming in at only 19 lb.\n\nTurbo conversions \n\nBrodie Britain Racing (BBR) of Brackley, United Kingdom, have had a long history of involvement with the first generation (NA) cars in the UK, having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991. This raised power output to 150 bhp, and produced 154 ftlb of torque. The kit comprised 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty. They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars, including for the 1991 'Le Mans' special edition, with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas. Two decades later in 2011, BBR now offer a turn-key refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to 220 bhp, and produces 175 ftlb of torque. The estimated top speed is now 140 mph, with 0–60 approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is the Garrett AiResearch GT25 ball bearing unit, and the package also includes an air-to-air intercooler, and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 the cost for a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is £7,500.EVO magazine, Issue 153, February 2011, pages 88–91\n\nIn the United States, NA (and later model) turbo conversions are available from companies like Flyin'Miata [https://www.flyinmiata.com] and Bell tuning [https://www.belltuning.com/] (formerly distributed by parent company BEGI engineering [https://www.bellengineering.net]). The conversions use mainly Garrett turbochargers (2860, 2556) and are available as a kit or fully installed. Bell Engineering offers a California Air Resources Board approved kit as well.\n\nTechnical specifications (UK)\n\n Second generation (NB) \n\nThe redesigned MX-5 was previewed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1997. In February 1998, Mazda released the second-generation MX-5, production code NB, for the 1999 model year. The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the third generation Mazda RX-7 model, designed in 1995 by Tom Matano. Prices in the United States, the main market for the MX-5, started at US$19,770.\n\nAlthough many parts of the interior and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's retractable headlamps no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model; its dimensions were: length 3945 mm, width 1678 mm, height 1228 mm and wheelbase 2265 mm. Without options, the NB weighed 1000 kg. The new generation was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a .\n\nThe NB continued to employ four-wheel independent suspension, with enlarged anti-roll bars at the front and rear, but the wheels, tires and brakes were significantly upgraded: anti-lock braking system was offered as an option; alloy wheels were now 14 in or 15 in in diameter and 6 in in width, depending on the trim package; sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195/50VR15 tires.\n\nThe BP-4W engine remained at  but received several minor updates. The engine compression ratio was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.5:1 by adding slightly domed pistons. The Pistons were upgraded to forged pistons and connecting rods; the intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam; the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up. Mazda's Variable Intake Control System was introduced, which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl, changing to a short, free-flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing. Power output of the new engine was quoted at  with 116 lbf.ft of torque.\n\nThe  B6 engine remained available in Europe and Japan. The base-model  NB could reach 62 mph in 7.8 s and had a top speed of 130 mph.\n\nMX-5 10th Anniversary Model (1999)\n\nIn 1999, Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX-5 with the 10th Anniversary Model, a limited edition featuring some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers; 15 inch chrome wheels with 195/50R15 tires; a very desirable Torsen limited-slip differential. Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in \"10th Anniversary Edition\"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue alcantara seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright gage rings, carbon grained center console panel and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0–100 km/h in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to Car and Driver, and 0.4 seconds faster according to Motor Trend. However, in spite of the 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from 210 to. Combined fuel consumption improved from .\n\nEach car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver-side front quarter panel. A \"Certificate of Authenticity\" with the same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1/24 scale diecast model, two Seiko-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box.\n\nDespite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model, it took more than a year to sell all units, drawing criticism that too many units had been produced (another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26,875, about $6500 more than a base model). 7,500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced,You and Your MX5/Miata, Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, . with 3,700 distributed to Europe (of which: 600 – UK, 20 – Portugal), 3,150 to North America (of which 3,000 to US and 150 to Canada), 500 to Japan and 150 to Australia, with car number 7,500 being sold in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, there were 3,500 units of the NC's 3rd Generation Limited launch model in 2005, and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1,500 units per region. The polished wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged. Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty. There were minor differences in specification according to the market, such as no sports appearance package (front/side/back skirts, rear wing) or air conditioning for Europe.\n\nFacelift (2001)\n\nFor the 2001 model year, a facelift to the second-generation MX-5 was released. There were some minor exterior changes, with a press-release of July 18, 2000, announcing the changes as \"resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look\". Fog lamps, previously an option, were made standard. Some cockpit elements were changed, with the instrument panel gauges receiving a white face and red numbers. The seats were also upgraded, incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests. Added for top models (designated 'Sport' in the U.K) were 16 in wheels with 205/45VR16 low-profile tires, larger brakes at the front and rear, additional chassis stiffening braces, a limited slip differential, a 6-speed manual gearbox, Bilstein suspension and leather seats. The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0.91 g in lateral grip in tests by Car and Driver magazine. The body was strengthened, gaining 16% in bending rigidity and 22% in torsional rigidity. With the minimum of options, the 2001 model weighed 1065 kg.\n\nThe  BP6D engine was slightly modified and now featured variable valve timing on the intake camshaft. The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade. These modifications resulted in a power output of 113 kW (Japan, UK and Australia) or 107 kW (US only). In the United States, Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues. Car and Driver magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power, and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims. Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period.\n\n2002 saw the launch of the MX-5 SP. The MX-5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced 157 kW at 6800 rpm. Only 100 of these cars were built. The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX-5 at the time but offered blistering performance. It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia.\n\nIn 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version (SV) Miata. The Shinsen (Japanese for \"Fresh and New\") provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS. Equipped with most standard features on the LS, such as cruise control and aluminum brush trim. This limited production model also shared an inverted color scheme of the same year Special Edition with a titanium silver exterior and dark blue top and interior.\n\nAlso in 2003, a division of Mazda in Japan released the Roadster Coupé, with a fixed hardtop roof. The body structure was reworked to incorporate the roof and gave a substantial increase in chassis rigidity with a weight increase of 10 kg. Production was limited to 179 units for Japan only, making this one of the rarest forms of the MX-5.\n\nMazdaspeed MX-5 (2004–2005)\n\nThe 2004 model year saw the introduction of the official turbocharged Mazdaspeed MX-5, Roadster Turbo in Japan. It featured an IHI RHF5 VJ35 turbocharger equipped variant of the BP-4W engine that produced  at 6500 rpm with a front-mounted air-to-air intercooler. The Mazdaspeed could reach 60 mph in 6.2 seconds but had a top speed of only 210 km/h due to its low 6,500 rev limiter. With its upgraded Bilstein suspension and wider tires, the Mazdaspeed model could pull over 0.98 g in lateral grip. Other features included upgraded 6-speed transmission and clutch assemblies, upgraded drivetrain components, Racing Hart 17 in alloy wheels, special interior trim. The 2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5 was only available in Velocity Red Mica and Titanium Gray Metallic for the US-market and Velocity Red Mica for the Canadian-market while the 2005 model was available additionally in Lava Orange Mica and Black Mica in the US-market, with Canada receiving only Titanium Grey Mica. Of the 5,428 Mazdaspeed MX-5s produced for the US Market during model years 2004 and 2005, 4,000 were produced in 2004; the 2005 production run was shortened to only 1428, due to a fire at the production facility. The other markets are not included in these totals. This model was also marketed in Australia as an MX-5 SE without any Mazdaspeed branding (exhaust tip excluded), featured 3.63 diff gears and was available in Sunlight Silver as well as Velocity Red Mica, Titanium Gray Metallic and Black Mica for 2005. It was also slightly detuned with only . Boost pressure was  for Australian model vs  of the North American and Japanese models which is the main contributor to the power difference. The MX-5 SE has been used for both gravel and tarmac rallying in Australia,  showing the versatility of these cars in racing.\n\nTechnical specifications (UK)\n\nSafety\n\nThe EuroNCAP Safety Ratings for MX-5s manufactured in 2002 were given 4 out of 5 stars for adult protection but only 1 out of 4 stars for pedestrian protection.\nEuroNCAP stated \"This is a poor performance despite the MX-5 benefiting from not having to have the leading edge of its bonnet tested because of its low profile.\"\n\n Third generation (NC) \n\nProduction of the third-generation MX-5, code NC, began May 17, 2005, for delivery in August, for the 2006 model year. This was partially due to the declining sales of the MX-5 during its second generation run. At its introduction in 2005, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.\n\nThe exterior styling (done by Yasushi Nakamuta until 2003) resembles the original design, but unlike the update from NA to NB, which was mostly a nose/tail/interior change, the NC shares no components with the NB, except for the side-panel turning-lights on non-US models. The lead stylist of this model generation was Moray Callum.\n\nWith the third generation, the suspension changed from a 4-wheel double wishbone setup to a front wishbone/rear multilink setup, shared with the Mazda RX-8. Technologies including traction control and stability control were added to increase driveability. According to Car and Driver, the NC has a skidpad number of 0.90g.\n\nFor the US, the engine is the new 16-valve,  MZR I4, producing 170 bhp and 140 lbf.ft coupled to either a 5-speed or a 6-speed manual transmission or 158 bhp with the optional 6-speed automatic transmission. A limited slip differential is available with the 6-speed option. In Australia the  MZR is offered, rated at 118 kW and 188 Nm and the 6-speed transmission and LSD are standard. In Europe, two engines are offered: the  MZR rated at 158 bhp and 188 Nm, coupled to the 6-speed manual transmission; and a new  MZR, rated at 126 bhp and 167 Nm, coupled to the 5-speed manual transmission.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission, with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters, is optional. A test by Car and Driver magazine revealed a 0-60 mph time of 6.5 s for the  U.S.-spec NC. Manufacturer figures for the European-spec model are: 0-100 km/h in 9.4 s () and 7.9 s (). As of this generation, the car no longer complies with Japanese law's maximum exterior width dimension for the mid-size vehicle tax class, making Japanese buyers liable for additional costs for ownership.\n\nThe NC was launched with a special edition called \"3rd Generation Limited\" which featured added chrome accents and special wheels. 3500 were built worldwide (300 in the UK, 750 in the US, 150 in Canada), delivered in advance of standard models.\n\nIn July 2006, Mazda debuted a coupé convertible version of the NC with a two-piece[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213004508/https://www.miata.net/news/images/rht06_001s.jpg Archive photo] folding hardtop, named \"MX-5 Roadster Coupe\" in Europe, \"Roadster Power Retractable Hard Top\" in Japan, and \"MX-5 Miata Power Retractable Hard Top\" in Canada and the US. The hardtop adds 36 kg to the weight of a comparably equipped soft top, without diminishing trunk space when retracted. Constructed of polycarbonate, the top requires 12 seconds to raise or lower, and the first models were delivered to customers in late August 2006. Performance times are slightly affected with the weight increase, to 9.6 s () and 8.2 s () from 0-100 km/h, but top speed is increased from 196 km/h (121.8 mph) to 200 km/h (124.3 mph) () and from 210 km/h to 215 km/h (), for the European-spec model.\n\n2007 MS-R Package\n\nThe MS-R (Motor Sport-Racing) package was designed specifically to enhance the on-track performance of the MX-5 in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Showroom Stock B (SSB) road racing and C- Stock (CS) autocrossing. The MS-R package is based on the SV model MX-5, which already includes a  2.0-liter four-cylinder MZR engine, five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes. The package adds a limited-slip differential, front shock-tower brace, underbody chassis bracing, 17-inch alloy wheels, Koni shock absorbers, racing-specific front and rear sway bars, higher-rate springs to provide a lower ride height and a rear lip spoiler.\n\n2008 Special Edition\n\nFor 2008, Mazda released a Special Edition MX-5 in Icy Blue exterior, with exclusive Dark Saddle Brown folding top, with matching leather with blue stitching steering wheel, seats, and hand brake. The Special Edition also featured a silver-accented shift knob, dark-silver finished instrument panel with chrome accents, special 17 in alloy wheels, stainless steel MX-5 scuff plate, and chrome front headlight bezel, as well as grille and fog lamp surrounds. The 2008 Special Edition was limited to 105 PRHT-equipped units in Canada and 750 soft-top units in the US.\n\n2008 Facelift\n\nThe MX-5 facelift was unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and Science Museum in London, and later in 2009 Chicago Auto Show.\n\nThe Japanese model went on sale in December 9, 2008 at Mazda and Mazda Anfini dealers.\n\nMajor changes concern the restyled front which now incorporates elements from Mazda’s newer models like the larger grille and new head and fog lights. Further restyled elements are the side skirts, rear bumper and the tail lights. The soft-top Touring and Grand Touring models feature a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame. The hardtop Roadster Coupe now features a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame and chrome elements inside the headlamps and outer door handles.\n\nThe instrument panel gained darker features and redesigned graphics for the gauges. To create more leg space in the cabin, a protrusion from the door pockets was eliminated.\n\nThe 2.0-litre engine was rated 167 bhp at 7,200 rpm and 140 lbft at 5,000 rpm for 5-speed manual, 158 bhp at 6,700 rpm with fuel cut at 7,200 rpm and 140 lbft at 5,000 rpm for automatic. Engine redline was raised by 500 rpm to 7,200 rpm in manual model and fuel cut at 7,500 rpm. The suspension and gearbox have been fine-tuned; latter offers smoother shifts and automatic transmission will be introduced in Europe for the first time.\n\nMX-5 Superlight version (2009)\n\nMX-5 Superlight is a concept car commemorating the 20th anniversary of MX-5, designed at Mazda's studio in Frankfurt, Germany.

The car is manufactured in Mazda’s Hiroshima plant. The vehicle was released in the third quarter of 2015. In the US, the release price of the MX-5 price was between $24,915 and $30,065. On March 24, 2016 the MX-5 was awarded World Car of the Year (WCOTY) and the World Car Design of the Year at the New York Auto Show. It was the second Mazda to win WCOTY following the Mazda 2 in 2008.\n\nThe fourth generation MX-5 is 105 mm shorter and 220 lb lighter than its predecessor, putting the vehicle's curb weight near 2200 lb. Incorporating Mazda's SKYACTIV technology, the Miata is offered with a choice of two direct-injection, naturally aspirated petrol engines. The base model has a 1.5 L 129 bhp engine, and the North American (USA and Canada) version has a 2.0 L 155 bhp engine. \n Mazda also replaced the hydraulic power steering system that the previous Miatas had with their new Electric Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) system.\n\nThe car was launched with both a six-speed manual shift transmission as well as a six-speed automatic transmission.  The cockpit, steering wheel, and infotainment system are very similar to the 2014 Mazda3.  The MX-5 is fitted as standard with a manually operated fabric roof that can be opened or closed within a few seconds.\n\nThe MX-5 (ND) has been very popular with diecast manufacturers like HotWheels and Matchbox, both companies releasing their own versions of the car to the market. \n\nMazda MX-5 RF\n\nIn late 2016, a new MX-5 RF (Retractable Fastback) model was announced.  It features a rigid roof and buttresses that give the silhouette a more coupé-like appearance than the soft top convertible. The top panel of the roof folds back whilst the buttresses remain in place, similar to a Targa top. The interior of the MX-5 RF model is almost the same as the soft top, with the same media screen, seats, steering wheel and switch gear. The MX-5 RF uses the same engines as the soft top model and offers similar performance. The MX-5 RF also introduced a new 'Machine Grey' paint.\n\nA limited edition run of 500 models was introduced with the launch of the Mazda MX-5 RF. Called the 'Launch Edition' these models were priced at £28,995 and were only available with the 160PS 2.0 litre engine. These models included BBS alloy wheels, a twin-tone roof, black door mirrors and rear spoiler as well as Recaro seats.

Fiat Chrysler announced a Fiat 124 Spider and Abarth versions based on the Mazda ND platform in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the Detroit News stated \"in partnering with Mazda’s MX-5 Miata to resurrect the classic Fiat 124 Spider, Fiat Chrysler not only gained a halo sports car for its struggling Italian brand, but likely saved the most celebrated small sports car of the past 25 years (the MX-5)\" — citing the markedly increased cost of developing a new car at the time and \"the costliest wave of government regulation since the 1970s.\"\n\nSpecifications\n\nSafety\n\nFour airbags are fitted as standard, including torso airbags, pelvis airbags and head airbags for driver and passenger.  Headrests provide protection from whiplash.  An Vehicle Stability Control+ (VSC+), an 'active' hood for pedestrian protection and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) are available. Since the MX-5 is a two-seater, the front passenger airbag can be disabled for safe transportation of children and the installation of a suitable rear-facing child seat restraint to be used in that position. In the Euro NCAP safety test, the MX suffered from a malfunctioning driver's airbag, which was unable to prevent the dummy from hitting the steering wheel. Its rating was 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nProduction numbers and details\n\nIn 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records declared the MX-5 the best-selling two-seat sports car in history, with total production of 531,890 units. The 250,000th MX-5 rolled out of the factory on November 9, 1992; the 500,000th, on February 8, 1999; the 750,000th, in March 2004; the 800,000th in January 2007, and 900,000th in February 2011.\n\nAs of April 2016, total production of MX-5 reached 1,000,000 units.  The one millionth car rolled off the production line and was shown in select cities, where the first 240 fans of the vehicle present could physically sign it before it went to the next destination.\n\nMazda also reapplied to Guinness World Records to have the record updated to 900,000 units.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n* Automobile Magazine \"Automobile of the Year\" in 1990.\n* Yahoo Autos 2016 Fresh Ride of the Year\n* Roadshow by CNET Editors Choice Best Convertibles 2016\n*World Car of the Year at the 2016 World Car Awards (UK)\n*2016 Car of the Year (UK).",

    "aggregatedText" : "The Mazda MX-5, released as the Mazda MX-5 Miata in North America and as the Eunos Roadster or Mazda Roadster in Japan, is a lightweight two-seater roadster with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan, the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. The MX-5 was conceived as a small roadster – with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements, while being technologically modern and reliable. The MX-5 is conceptually the evolution and spiritual successor of the British sports cars of the 1950s & '60s, such as the Triumph Spitfire, Austin-Healey 100, MG MGA, and particularly the Lotus Elan.\n\nThe second generation MX-5 (NB) was launched in 1998 (for the 1999 model year), the third generation (NC) model was launched in 2005 (for the 2006 model year), and a fourth generation (ND) was released in 2015 (for the 2016 model year). It continues to be the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history and by April 2016, over one million MX-5s had been built and sold around the world.\nProduction of the MX-5 had fallen by 2013 to below 14,000 units, due to the world finance crisis in 2008, and the pre-announcement in 2012 of the coming ND model.\n\nSince the launch of the third generation, Mazda has consolidated worldwide marketing using the MX-5 name with the exception of the United States where it is marketed as the MX-5 Miata, and Japan, where it is known as the Roadster. The name \"miata\" derives from Old High German for \"reward\".\n\nGenerations and overview\n\nThe MX-5's first generation, the NA, sold over 400,000 units from May 1989 to 1997 – with a  straight-4 engine to 1993, a  engine thereafter (with a de-tuned 1.6 as a budget option in some markets) – recognizable by its pop-up headlights. The second generation (NB) was introduced in 1999 with a slight increase in engine power; it can be recognized by the fixed headlights and the glass rear window, although first generation owners may opt for the glass window design when replacing the original top. The third generation (NC) was introduced in 2006 with a  engine.\n\nLaunched at a time when production of small roadsters had almost come to an end, the Alfa Romeo Spider was the only comparable volume model in production at the time of the MX-5's launch. Just a decade earlier, a host of similar models — notably the MG B, Triumph TR7, Triumph Spitfire, and Fiat Spider — had been available.\n\nThe body is a conventional, but light, unibody or monocoque construction, with (detachable) front and rear subframes. The MX-5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential, minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling. Some MX-5s feature limited slip differentials and anti-lock braking system. Traction control is an option available on NC models. All models weighed approximately one tonne.\n\nWith an approximate 50:50 front/rear weight balance, the car has nearly neutral handling. Inducing oversteer is easy and very controllable, thus making the MX-5 a popular choice for amateur and stock racing, including, in the US, the Sports Car Club of America's Solo2 autocross and Spec Miata race series, and in the UK, the [http://www.5clubracing.co.uk 5Club Racing] championship. Raddatz and Otten won the AASA Australian Endurance Championship in 2011.\n\nThe MX-5 has won awards including Wheels Magazine 's Car of the Year for 1989, 2005 and 2016; Sports Car Internationals \"best sports car of the 1990s\" and \"ten best sports cars of all time\"; 2005–2006 Car of the Year Japan; and 2005 Australian Car of the Year. The Miata has also made Car and Driver magazine's annual Ten Best list 14 times. In their December 2009 issue, Grassroots Motorsports magazine named the Miata as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years.\n\nIn 2009, English automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson wrote: \n\nDesign genesis\n\nIn 1976, Bob Hall, a journalist at Motor Trend magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language, met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai, head of Research and Development at Mazda. Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future:\n\nIn 1981, Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto, now chairman of Mazda Motors, who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go-ahead to research the idea further. At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California. There, Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image, proportion and visualization of the \"light-weight sports\" concept. In 1983, the idea turned concept was approved under the \"Offline 55\" program, an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed. Thus, under head of project Masakatsu, the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California.\n\nThe Californian team proposed a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, codenamed Duo 101, in line with the British roadster ancestry, but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout or the rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.\n\nThe first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984, with designs presented on paper only. The mid-engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities, although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) requirements of the project. It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984, when full-scale clay models were presented, that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX-5.\n\nThe Duo 101, so named as either a soft top or hardtop could be used, incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan, a 1960s roadster, including the door handles and grille opening. International Automotive Design (IAD) in Worthing, England was commissioned to develop a running prototype, codenamed V705. It was built with a fiberglass body, a  engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models. The V705 was completed in August 1985 and taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara, California and got positive reactions.\n\nThe project received final approval on 18 January 1986. The model's codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase, under head of program Toshihiko Hirai. The task of constructing five engineering mules (more developed prototypes) was again allocated to IAD, which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729. While Tom Matano, Mark Jordan, Wu Huang Chin, Norman Garrett, and Koichi Hayashi worked on the final design, the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details.\n\nBy 1989, with a definitive model name now chosen, the MX-5 was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car, weighing just 940 kg.\n\nAlthough Mazda's concept was for the MX-5 to be an inexpensive sports car, at introduction the design met strong demand, with many dealers placing customers on pre-order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup.\n\nJinba ittai\n\nMazda used a design credo across the four generations of the MX-5's development: the phrase , which translates loosely into English as \"rider (jin) and horse (ba) as one body (ittai)\".\n\nWith the first generation of the MX-5, the phrase was developed into five specific core design requirements:\n* That the car would be as compact and as light as possible while meeting global safety requirements.\n* That the cockpit would comfortably accommodate two full-stature occupants with no wasted space.\n* That the basic layout would continue with the original's front-midship rear-drive configuration with the engine positioned ahead of the driver but behind the front axle for 50:50 weight distribution.\n* That all four wheels would be attached by wishbone or multi-link suspension systems to maximize tire performance, road grip, and dynamic stability.\n* And that a power-plant frame would again provide a solid connection between the engine and rear-mounted differential to sharpen throttle response.\n\n First generation (NA) \n\nThe MX-5 was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show on February 10, 1989, with a price tag of . The MX-5, with production code NA, was made available for delivery to buyers worldwide in the following dates: May 1989 (as a 1990 model) in the US and Canada; September 1, 1989 in Japan; and 1990 in Europe. An optional hardtop was made available at the same time, in sheet moulding compound (SMC). Demand initially outstripped production, fueled by enthusiastic press reviews.\n\nIn Japan, the car was not badged as a Mazda, as the company was experimenting with the creation of different marques for deluxe models, similar to Nissan's Infiniti, Honda's Acura and Toyota's Lexus. Instead, the Mazda MX-5 was sold as the Eunos Roadster in Japan, and was joined by the MX-3/AZ-3/Eunos Presso (based on Japanese Mazda dealerships). The exterior dimensions were also in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the two engines provided Japanese buyers a choice that obligated an affordable road tax option.\n\nThe body shell of the NA was all-steel with a light-weight aluminium hood. Overall dimensions were 3970 mm in length, 1675 mm in width, and 1235 mm in height. Without options, the NA weighed only 2150 lb. It had a . Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels, with an anti-roll bar at the front and rear. Four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated at the front, were behind alloy wheels with 185/60HR14 radial tires. The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then-current 323/Protege.\n\nThe original MX-5 came with a  dual overhead cam inline four-cylinder engine, producing 86 kW at 6500 rpm, and 136 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm. The engine employs an electronic fuel injection system using a vane-type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a camshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor. This engine, codename B6ZE(RS), was specifically designed for the MX-5 and featured a lightened crankshaft, flywheel, and aluminum sump with cooling fins.\n\nThe standard transmission was a five-speed manual, a unit derived from the one used in the Mazda 929/Luce (also rear-wheel drive). The gear shift was the subject of close attention during development, with engineers told to make it shift in as small a gear pattern as possible and with minimal effort.Garrett, p. 10 In Japan and the US, an optional automatic transmission was also offered but proved to be unpopular. The Japanese and American markets also received an optional viscous limited slip rear differential, although it was only available for cars with a manual transmission. To achieve the low introductory price, the base model was stripped. It had steel wheels, manual steering, roll-up windows, and no stereo or air-conditioning. Power steering, air-conditioning, and stereo were added as standard equipment in later years.\n\n These have a numbered brass plaque on the dash above the glovebox and on the front of the Owners Book, and are fitted with alloy wheels from MSW (Mazda Sports Workshop) which are often mistaken for BBS's, but which are entirely unique to this model.\n\n1500 LE (Limited Edition) cars were produced in 1993. This model featured red leather interior, upgraded stereo, Nardi shift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise, limited slip differential, power windows, power mirrors, power steering, air conditioning, BBS wheels, Bilstein shocks, front and rear spoilers, ABS brakes, stainless sill plates, and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim. All 1993 LE cars came in black.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, the first-generation MX-5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful  BP-ZE engine, dual airbags and a limited slip differential in some markets. The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side-impact standards, most visibly by adding a \"track bar\" between the seatbelt towers inside the car, but also to the front and rear subframes. Also, 1994 and 1995 were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint (Laguna Blue Mica), making these cars rare collectors cars to some. 1994 also saw the introduction of the \"R\" package, a sport-themed package with Bilstein shocks and subtle underbody spoilers, in addition to the removal of unnecessary items such as power steering. No body style changes were made, however.\n\nThe new  engine produced 98 kW, which was then increased to 99 kW for the 1996 model year. The base weight increased to 990 kg. Performance was thus improved slightly, because the additional weight was partly offset by the extra power. In some markets such as Europe, the  engine continued to be available as a lower-cost option, but was detuned to 66 kW. This lower-powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new . Japanese and US cars were fitted with an optional Torsen LSD, which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential.\n\nThere were a number of trim levels and special editions available, determined by local Mazda marketing departments. In the US, the base model was offered for US$13,995 at launch and was very basic, with manual windows, steel wheels, and without A/C or power steering. The \"A Package\" offered power steering, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo. The \"B Package\" added power windows, along with cruise control and headrest speakers, while the \"C Package\" included a tan interior and top and leather seats. The \"R Package\" was for racing, and the annual special editions were formalized as \"M Editions\". These included all of the luxury options from the \"C Package\" as well as special paint and, sometimes, special wheels. In the UK, to celebrate Mazda's 24 hours of Le Mans win, Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX-5, with the winner's color scheme (see Mazda 787B) and came equipped with BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX-5s.\n\nThe first generation MX-5 was phased out after the 1997 model year (with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA), with the final 1500 NAs produced for the US market being the \"STO\" (\"Special Touring Option\") versions.\n\nM2 special editions\n\nA small range of Miata units were assembled by the M2 Incorporated. Founded in November 1991, M2, also known as \"Mazda Too\", was Mazda's new off-line planning / niche-house / Research & Development company back in the early '90s. The M2 Corp. employees had noble intentions — creating niche-mobiles derived from Mazda's volume products. Although M2's basic mission involved focusing on the \"soft\" aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants, the changes to the off-line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics.\n\nHeading the M2 operation was Mr. Masakatsu Kato, original father of the Miata (Eunos Roadster) in Japan, as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles. Kato-san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana, development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the FC (second-generation RX-7) and the NA Roadster (Miata MX-5). M2 Corp. was based out of Tokyo, Japan. M2-Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda, and it was closed by Mazda in 1995. Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles, and then in the late '90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo. There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995, beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer (Dec-91).\n\nM2-1001 Cafe Roadster (Dec-91) Limited 1/300\nM2 Corp. released the M2-1001 Roadster in December 1991. It was a special \"Limited Production\" Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units, in a special Blue/Black Mica Paint, with a sticker price of $26,000. Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2's Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster.\n\nThis upscale Eunos Roadster was M2's first turn-key, race-ready offering. A list of popular features, while not exhaustive, is as follows: functional front airdam with integrated fog lamps, vintage aero mirrors, 4-point roll bar, vintage gauge cluster, fixed back bucket seats, polished 3-spoke steering wheel, stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates, polished aluminum strut brace, upgraded exhaust by HKS, intake system, 1.6L motor with new aggressive pistons, upgraded camshaft, lightweight flywheel, LSD cooling intake, manual steering, manual windows (A/C was optional), racing pedals, centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel, aluminum gas filler cap, a more aggressive wheel & tire package (15\" x 6\" Panasport rims), and a rear spoiler (which became standard for the R package). The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to 132 bhp @ 7,000 rpm, and 109 lbf.ft of torque @ 5,500 rpm. Once released, it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35,000 for one.\n\nM2-1002 Vintage Roadster (Nov-92) Limited 1/300\nM2-CORP released its second Roadster in late 1992, with a slightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster. This one did not do as well as the 1001.\n\nM2-1028 Street Competition Roadster (Feb-94) Limited 1/300\nM2-CORP released its third Roadster in early 1994, based on the original \"Jinba Ittai\" concept made by Toshihiko Hirai. This was billed as a track-ready Roadster. (The US saw a cheaper version known as the R-Package.) Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only, this Roadster used the new 1.8L powerplant with upgraded pistons, camshafts, and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002. This Roadster had an output of close to 150 bhp, and included 14\" Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip. The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors, MOMO Steering Wheel, Centerless console, racing seats, racing tow hook,  a set of lower lip spoilers (R-Package), and a newly designed \"Duck-Tail\" trunk lid with integrated spoiler. The M2-1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only , a very light weight from the original lid of . It also came with a 6-point roll cage, but no soft-top, instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage. With optional FRP Hardtop with plexiglass rear window for more weight savings coming in at only 19 lb.\n\nTurbo conversions \n\nBrodie Britain Racing (BBR) of Brackley, United Kingdom, have had a long history of involvement with the first generation (NA) cars in the UK, having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991. This raised power output to 150 bhp, and produced 154 ftlb of torque. The kit comprised 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty. They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars, including for the 1991 'Le Mans' special edition, with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas. Two decades later in 2011, BBR now offer a turn-key refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to 220 bhp, and produces 175 ftlb of torque. The estimated top speed is now 140 mph, with 0–60 approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is the Garrett AiResearch GT25 ball bearing unit, and the package also includes an air-to-air intercooler, and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 the cost for a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is £7,500.EVO magazine, Issue 153, February 2011, pages 88–91\n\nIn the United States, NA (and later model) turbo conversions are available from companies like Flyin'Miata [https://www.flyinmiata.com] and Bell tuning [https://www.belltuning.com/] (formerly distributed by parent company BEGI engineering [https://www.bellengineering.net]). The conversions use mainly Garrett turbochargers (2860, 2556) and are available as a kit or fully installed. Bell Engineering offers a California Air Resources Board approved kit as well.\n\nTechnical specifications (UK)\n\n Second generation (NB) \n\nThe redesigned MX-5 was previewed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1997. In February 1998, Mazda released the second-generation MX-5, production code NB, for the 1999 model year. The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the third generation Mazda RX-7 model, designed in 1995 by Tom Matano. Prices in the United States, the main market for the MX-5, started at US$19,770.\n\nAlthough many parts of the interior and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's retractable headlamps no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model; its dimensions were: length 3945 mm, width 1678 mm, height 1228 mm and wheelbase 2265 mm. Without options, the NB weighed 1000 kg. The new generation was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a .\n\nThe NB continued to employ four-wheel independent suspension, with enlarged anti-roll bars at the front and rear, but the wheels, tires and brakes were significantly upgraded: anti-lock braking system was offered as an option; alloy wheels were now 14 in or 15 in in diameter and 6 in in width, depending on the trim package; sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195/50VR15 tires.\n\nThe BP-4W engine remained at  but received several minor updates. The engine compression ratio was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.5:1 by adding slightly domed pistons. The Pistons were upgraded to forged pistons and connecting rods; the intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam; the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up. Mazda's Variable Intake Control System was introduced, which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl, changing to a short, free-flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing. Power output of the new engine was quoted at  with 116 lbf.ft of torque.\n\nThe  B6 engine remained available in Europe and Japan. The base-model  NB could reach 62 mph in 7.8 s and had a top speed of 130 mph.\n\nMX-5 10th Anniversary Model (1999)\n\nIn 1999, Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX-5 with the 10th Anniversary Model, a limited edition featuring some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers; 15 inch chrome wheels with 195/50R15 tires; a very desirable Torsen limited-slip differential. Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in \"10th Anniversary Edition\"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue alcantara seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright gage rings, carbon grained center console panel and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0–100 km/h in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to Car and Driver, and 0.4 seconds faster according to Motor Trend. However, in spite of the 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from 210 to. Combined fuel consumption improved from .\n\nEach car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver-side front quarter panel. A \"Certificate of Authenticity\" with the same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1/24 scale diecast model, two Seiko-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box.\n\nDespite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model, it took more than a year to sell all units, drawing criticism that too many units had been produced (another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26,875, about $6500 more than a base model). 7,500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced,You and Your MX5/Miata, Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, . with 3,700 distributed to Europe (of which: 600 – UK, 20 – Portugal), 3,150 to North America (of which 3,000 to US and 150 to Canada), 500 to Japan and 150 to Australia, with car number 7,500 being sold in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, there were 3,500 units of the NC's 3rd Generation Limited launch model in 2005, and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1,500 units per region. The polished wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged. Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty. There were minor differences in specification according to the market, such as no sports appearance package (front/side/back skirts, rear wing) or air conditioning for Europe.\n\nFacelift (2001)\n\nFor the 2001 model year, a facelift to the second-generation MX-5 was released. There were some minor exterior changes, with a press-release of July 18, 2000, announcing the changes as \"resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look\". Fog lamps, previously an option, were made standard. Some cockpit elements were changed, with the instrument panel gauges receiving a white face and red numbers. The seats were also upgraded, incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests. Added for top models (designated 'Sport' in the U.K) were 16 in wheels with 205/45VR16 low-profile tires, larger brakes at the front and rear, additional chassis stiffening braces, a limited slip differential, a 6-speed manual gearbox, Bilstein suspension and leather seats. The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0.91 g in lateral grip in tests by Car and Driver magazine. The body was strengthened, gaining 16% in bending rigidity and 22% in torsional rigidity. With the minimum of options, the 2001 model weighed 1065 kg.\n\nThe  BP6D engine was slightly modified and now featured variable valve timing on the intake camshaft. The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade. These modifications resulted in a power output of 113 kW (Japan, UK and Australia) or 107 kW (US only). In the United States, Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues. Car and Driver magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power, and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims. Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period.\n\n2002 saw the launch of the MX-5 SP. The MX-5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced 157 kW at 6800 rpm. Only 100 of these cars were built. The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX-5 at the time but offered blistering performance. It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia.\n\nIn 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version (SV) Miata. The Shinsen (Japanese for \"Fresh and New\") provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS. Equipped with most standard features on the LS, such as cruise control and aluminum brush trim. This limited production model also shared an inverted color scheme of the same year Special Edition with a titanium silver exterior and dark blue top and interior.\n\nAlso in 2003, a division of Mazda in Japan released the Roadster Coupé, with a fixed hardtop roof. The body structure was reworked to incorporate the roof and gave a substantial increase in chassis rigidity with a weight increase of 10 kg. Production was limited to 179 units for Japan only, making this one of the rarest forms of the MX-5.\n\nMazdaspeed MX-5 (2004–2005)\n\nThe 2004 model year saw the introduction of the official turbocharged Mazdaspeed MX-5, Roadster Turbo in Japan. It featured an IHI RHF5 VJ35 turbocharger equipped variant of the BP-4W engine that produced  at 6500 rpm with a front-mounted air-to-air intercooler. The Mazdaspeed could reach 60 mph in 6.2 seconds but had a top speed of only 210 km/h due to its low 6,500 rev limiter. With its upgraded Bilstein suspension and wider tires, the Mazdaspeed model could pull over 0.98 g in lateral grip. Other features included upgraded 6-speed transmission and clutch assemblies, upgraded drivetrain components, Racing Hart 17 in alloy wheels, special interior trim. The 2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5 was only available in Velocity Red Mica and Titanium Gray Metallic for the US-market and Velocity Red Mica for the Canadian-market while the 2005 model was available additionally in Lava Orange Mica and Black Mica in the US-market, with Canada receiving only Titanium Grey Mica. Of the 5,428 Mazdaspeed MX-5s produced for the US Market during model years 2004 and 2005, 4,000 were produced in 2004; the 2005 production run was shortened to only 1428, due to a fire at the production facility. The other markets are not included in these totals. This model was also marketed in Australia as an MX-5 SE without any Mazdaspeed branding (exhaust tip excluded), featured 3.63 diff gears and was available in Sunlight Silver as well as Velocity Red Mica, Titanium Gray Metallic and Black Mica for 2005. It was also slightly detuned with only . Boost pressure was  for Australian model vs  of the North American and Japanese models which is the main contributor to the power difference. The MX-5 SE has been used for both gravel and tarmac rallying in Australia,  showing the versatility of these cars in racing.\n\nTechnical specifications (UK)\n\nSafety\n\nThe EuroNCAP Safety Ratings for MX-5s manufactured in 2002 were given 4 out of 5 stars for adult protection but only 1 out of 4 stars for pedestrian protection.\nEuroNCAP stated \"This is a poor performance despite the MX-5 benefiting from not having to have the leading edge of its bonnet tested because of its low profile.\"\n\n Third generation (NC) \n\nProduction of the third-generation MX-5, code NC, began May 17, 2005, for delivery in August, for the 2006 model year. This was partially due to the declining sales of the MX-5 during its second generation run. At its introduction in 2005, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.\n\nThe exterior styling (done by Yasushi Nakamuta until 2003) resembles the original design, but unlike the update from NA to NB, which was mostly a nose/tail/interior change, the NC shares no components with the NB, except for the side-panel turning-lights on non-US models. The lead stylist of this model generation was Moray Callum.\n\nWith the third generation, the suspension changed from a 4-wheel double wishbone setup to a front wishbone/rear multilink setup, shared with the Mazda RX-8. Technologies including traction control and stability control were added to increase driveability. According to Car and Driver, the NC has a skidpad number of 0.90g.\n\nFor the US, the engine is the new 16-valve,  MZR I4, producing 170 bhp and 140 lbf.ft coupled to either a 5-speed or a 6-speed manual transmission or 158 bhp with the optional 6-speed automatic transmission. A limited slip differential is available with the 6-speed option. In Australia the  MZR is offered, rated at 118 kW and 188 Nm and the 6-speed transmission and LSD are standard. In Europe, two engines are offered: the  MZR rated at 158 bhp and 188 Nm, coupled to the 6-speed manual transmission; and a new  MZR, rated at 126 bhp and 167 Nm, coupled to the 5-speed manual transmission.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission, with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters, is optional. A test by Car and Driver magazine revealed a 0-60 mph time of 6.5 s for the  U.S.-spec NC. Manufacturer figures for the European-spec model are: 0-100 km/h in 9.4 s () and 7.9 s (). As of this generation, the car no longer complies with Japanese law's maximum exterior width dimension for the mid-size vehicle tax class, making Japanese buyers liable for additional costs for ownership.\n\nThe NC was launched with a special edition called \"3rd Generation Limited\" which featured added chrome accents and special wheels. 3500 were built worldwide (300 in the UK, 750 in the US, 150 in Canada), delivered in advance of standard models.\n\nIn July 2006, Mazda debuted a coupé convertible version of the NC with a two-piece[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213004508/https://www.miata.net/news/images/rht06_001s.jpg Archive photo] folding hardtop, named \"MX-5 Roadster Coupe\" in Europe, \"Roadster Power Retractable Hard Top\" in Japan, and \"MX-5 Miata Power Retractable Hard Top\" in Canada and the US. The hardtop adds 36 kg to the weight of a comparably equipped soft top, without diminishing trunk space when retracted. Constructed of polycarbonate, the top requires 12 seconds to raise or lower, and the first models were delivered to customers in late August 2006. Performance times are slightly affected with the weight increase, to 9.6 s () and 8.2 s () from 0-100 km/h, but top speed is increased from 196 km/h (121.8 mph) to 200 km/h (124.3 mph) () and from 210 km/h to 215 km/h (), for the European-spec model.\n\n2007 MS-R Package\n\nThe MS-R (Motor Sport-Racing) package was designed specifically to enhance the on-track performance of the MX-5 in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Showroom Stock B (SSB) road racing and C- Stock (CS) autocrossing. The MS-R package is based on the SV model MX-5, which already includes a  2.0-liter four-cylinder MZR engine, five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes. The package adds a limited-slip differential, front shock-tower brace, underbody chassis bracing, 17-inch alloy wheels, Koni shock absorbers, racing-specific front and rear sway bars, higher-rate springs to provide a lower ride height and a rear lip spoiler.\n\n2008 Special Edition\n\nFor 2008, Mazda released a Special Edition MX-5 in Icy Blue exterior, with exclusive Dark Saddle Brown folding top, with matching leather with blue stitching steering wheel, seats, and hand brake. The Special Edition also featured a silver-accented shift knob, dark-silver finished instrument panel with chrome accents, special 17 in alloy wheels, stainless steel MX-5 scuff plate, and chrome front headlight bezel, as well as grille and fog lamp surrounds. The 2008 Special Edition was limited to 105 PRHT-equipped units in Canada and 750 soft-top units in the US.\n\n2008 Facelift\n\nThe MX-5 facelift was unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and Science Museum in London, and later in 2009 Chicago Auto Show.\n\nThe Japanese model went on sale in December 9, 2008 at Mazda and Mazda Anfini dealers.\n\nMajor changes concern the restyled front which now incorporates elements from Mazda’s newer models like the larger grille and new head and fog lights. Further restyled elements are the side skirts, rear bumper and the tail lights. The soft-top Touring and Grand Touring models feature a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame. The hardtop Roadster Coupe now features a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame and chrome elements inside the headlamps and outer door handles.\n\nThe instrument panel gained darker features and redesigned graphics for the gauges. To create more leg space in the cabin, a protrusion from the door pockets was eliminated.\n\nThe 2.0-litre engine was rated 167 bhp at 7,200 rpm and 140 lbft at 5,000 rpm for 5-speed manual, 158 bhp at 6,700 rpm with fuel cut at 7,200 rpm and 140 lbft at 5,000 rpm for automatic. Engine redline was raised by 500 rpm to 7,200 rpm in manual model and fuel cut at 7,500 rpm. The suspension and gearbox have been fine-tuned; latter offers smoother shifts and automatic transmission will be introduced in Europe for the first time.\n\nMX-5 Superlight version (2009)\n\nMX-5 Superlight is a concept car commemorating the 20th anniversary of MX-5, designed at Mazda's studio in Frankfurt, Germany.

The car is manufactured in Mazda’s Hiroshima plant. The vehicle was released in the third quarter of 2015. In the US, the release price of the MX-5 price was between $24,915 and $30,065. On March 24, 2016 the MX-5 was awarded World Car of the Year (WCOTY) and the World Car Design of the Year at the New York Auto Show. It was the second Mazda to win WCOTY following the Mazda 2 in 2008.\n\nThe fourth generation MX-5 is 105 mm shorter and 220 lb lighter than its predecessor, putting the vehicle's curb weight near 2200 lb. Incorporating Mazda's SKYACTIV technology, the Miata is offered with a choice of two direct-injection, naturally aspirated petrol engines. The base model has a 1.5 L 129 bhp engine, and the North American (USA and Canada) version has a 2.0 L 155 bhp engine. \n Mazda also replaced the hydraulic power steering system that the previous Miatas had with their new Electric Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) system.\n\nThe car was launched with both a six-speed manual shift transmission as well as a six-speed automatic transmission.  The cockpit, steering wheel, and infotainment system are very similar to the 2014 Mazda3.  The MX-5 is fitted as standard with a manually operated fabric roof that can be opened or closed within a few seconds.\n\nThe MX-5 (ND) has been very popular with diecast manufacturers like HotWheels and Matchbox, both companies releasing their own versions of the car to the market. \n\nMazda MX-5 RF\n\nIn late 2016, a new MX-5 RF (Retractable Fastback) model was announced.  It features a rigid roof and buttresses that give the silhouette a more coupé-like appearance than the soft top convertible. The top panel of the roof folds back whilst the buttresses remain in place, similar to a Targa top. The interior of the MX-5 RF model is almost the same as the soft top, with the same media screen, seats, steering wheel and switch gear. The MX-5 RF uses the same engines as the soft top model and offers similar performance. The MX-5 RF also introduced a new 'Machine Grey' paint.\n\nA limited edition run of 500 models was introduced with the launch of the Mazda MX-5 RF. Called the 'Launch Edition' these models were priced at £28,995 and were only available with the 160PS 2.0 litre engine.

Fiat Chrysler announced a Fiat 124 Spider and Abarth versions based on the Mazda ND platform in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the Detroit News stated \"in partnering with Mazda’s MX-5 Miata to resurrect the classic Fiat 124 Spider, Fiat Chrysler not only gained a halo sports car for its struggling Italian brand, but likely saved the most celebrated small sports car of the past 25 years (the MX-5)\" — citing the markedly increased cost of developing a new car at the time and \"the costliest wave of government regulation since the 1970s.\"\n\nSpecifications\n\nSafety\n\nFour airbags are fitted as standard, including torso airbags, pelvis airbags and head airbags for driver and passenger.  Headrests provide protection from whiplash.  An Vehicle Stability Control+ (VSC+), an 'active' hood for pedestrian protection and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) are available. Since the MX-5 is a two-seater, the front passenger airbag can be disabled for safe transportation of children and the installation of a suitable rear-facing child seat restraint to be used in that position. In the Euro NCAP safety test, the MX suffered from a malfunctioning driver's airbag, which was unable to prevent the dummy from hitting the steering wheel. Its rating was 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nProduction numbers and details\n\nIn 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records declared the MX-5 the best-selling two-seat sports car in history, with total production of 531,890 units. The 250,000th MX-5 rolled out of the factory on November 9, 1992; the 500,000th, on February 8, 1999; the 750,000th, in March 2004; the 800,000th in January 2007, and 900,000th in February 2011.\n\nAs of April 2016, total production of MX-5 reached 1,000,000 units.  The one millionth car rolled off the production line and was shown in select cities, where the first 240 fans of the vehicle present could physically sign it before it went to the next destination.\n\nMazda also reapplied to Guinness World Records to have the record updated to 900,000 units.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n* Automobile Magazine \"Automobile of the Year\" in 1990.\n* Yahoo Autos 2016 Fresh Ride of the Year\n* Roadshow by CNET Editors Choice Best Convertibles 2016\n*World Car of the Year at the 2016 World Car Awards (UK)\n*2016 Car of the Year (UK).
