  "textBody" : "The Kaddish or Qaddish (, qaddiš \"holy\"; alternative spellings: ḳaddish) is a hymn of praises to God found in Jewish prayer services. The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God's name. In the liturgy, different versions of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between sections of the service.\n\nThe term \"Kaddish\" is often used to refer specifically to \"The Mourner's Kaddish\", said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services, as well as at funerals (other than at the gravesite, see Qaddish aḥar Haqqəvurah \"Qaddish after Burial\") and memorials, and for 11 months after the death of a close relative. When mention is made of \"saying Kaddish\", this unambiguously refers to the rituals of mourning. Mourners say Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God.\n\nThe opening words of this prayer are inspired by , a vision of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations. The central line of the Kaddish in Jewish tradition is the congregation's response:  (Yǝhē šmēh rabbā mǝvārakh lǝʿālam u-lʿalmē ʿālmayyā, \"May His great name be blessed for ever, and to all eternity\"), a public declaration of God's greatness and eternality. This response is an Aramaic translation of the Hebrew \"\" (Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever), which is to be found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (, Genesis 49:2 and Deuteronomy 6:4), and is similar to the wording of .\n\nThe Mourners, Rabbis and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace (\"Oseh Shalom...\"), which is in Hebrew, and is somewhat similar to the Tanakh .\n\nAlong with the Shema Yisrael and Amidah, the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy. Kaddish cannot be recited alone. Along with some prayers, it can only be recited with a minyan of ten Jews.\n\nHistory and background\n\n\"The Kaddish is in origin a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse.\"Pool, D. de S., The Kaddish, Sivan Press, Ltd, Jerusalem, 1909, (3rd printing, 1964). (see David de Sola Pool) Most of it is written in Aramaic, which, at the time of its original composition, was the lingua franca of the Jewish people. It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic, however, but rather in a \"literary, jargon Aramaic\" that was used in the academies, and is identical to the dialect of the Targum.\n\nThe oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon, c. 900. Shira Schoenberg observes that \"The first mention of mourners saying Kaddish at the end of the service is in a 13th century halakhic writing by Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, the Or Zarua (\"Light is Sown\"). The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner's Kaddish (literally, \"Orphan's Kaddish\").\n\nVariant forms\n\nThe various versions of the Kaddish are:\n* Ḥaṣi Qaddish (חצי קדיש) or Qaddish Lʿela (קדיש לעלא)Literally \"Half Kaddish\", sometimes called the \"Reader's Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish Yatom (קדיש יתום) or Qaddish Yehe Shlama Rabba (קדיש יהא שלמא רבא)Literally \"Orphan's Kaddish\", although commonly referred to as Qaddish Avelim (קדיש אבלים), the \"Mourner's Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish Shalem (קדיש שלם) or Qaddish Titkabbal (קדיש תתקבל)Literally \"Complete Kaddish\" or \"Whole Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish de Rabbanan (קדיש דרבנן) or Qaddish ʿal Yisraʾel (קדיש על ישראל)Literally \"Kaddish of the Rabbis\"\n* Qaddish aḥar Haqqvura (קדיש אחר הקבורה)Literally \"Kaddish after a Burial\", also called Kaddish d'Ithadata (קדיש דאתחדתא) named after one of the first distinguishing words in this variant.\n* Qaddish aḥar Hashlamat Masechet (קדיש אחר השלמת מסכת)Literally, \"Kaddish after the completion of a tractate,\" i.e. at a siyum (in Sefardi practice, same as Qaddish de Rabbanan), also called Qaddish haGadol (קדיש הגדול) \"the Great Qaddish\", as it is the longest Kaddish.\n\nAll versions of the Kaddish begin with the Hatzi Kaddish (there are some extra passages in the Kaddish after a burial or a siyum). The longer versions contain additional paragraphs, and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs.\n\nThe Half Kaddish is used to punctuate divisions within the service: for example, before Barechu, between the Shema Yisrael and the Amidah and following readings from the Torah. The Kaddish d'Rabbanan is used after any part of the service that includes extracts from the Mishnah or the Talmud, as its original purpose was to close a study session.  Kaddish Titkabbal originally marked the end of the service, though in later times extra passages and hymns were added to follow it.\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedias article on Kaddish mentions an additional type of Kaddish, called Qaddish Yahid \"Individual's Kaddish\". This is included in the Siddur of Amram Gaon, but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense.\n\nText of the Kaddish\n\nThe following includes the half, complete, mourner's and rabbi's kaddish. The variant lines of the kaddish after a burial or a siyum are given below.\n\nText of the burial kaddish\n\nIn the burial kaddish, and that after a siyum according to Ashkenazim,i, lines 2-3 are replaced by:\n\nRecent additions to Oseh Shalom\n\nIn some recent prayerbooks, for example, the American Reform Machzor, line 36 is replaced with:\n\nThis effort to extend the reach of Oseh Shalom to non-Jews is said to have been started by the British Liberal Jewish movement in 1967, with the introduction of v'al kol bnai Adam (\"and upon all children of Adam\"); these words continue to be used by some in the UK.\n\nNOTE: The phrase בן אדם (ben adam) pl. בני אדם (bnai adam) literally means \"son of adam\" or \"son of man\" but in Hebrew usage the phrase is taken to mean \"human.\" The British usage above, then would be to invoke peace on all humankind, rather than on sons of children or descendants of Adam.\n\nNotes \n\n* Bracketed text varies according to personal or communal traditions.\n* (a) The congregation responds with \"amen\" (אָמֵן) after lines 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 27, 33, 36. In the Ashkenazi tradition, the response to line 12 is \"Blessed be he\" (בְּרִיךְ הוּא b'rikh hu).\n* (b) On line 1, some say Yitgaddeyl veyitqaddeysh rather than Yitgaddal veyitqaddash, because the roots of these two words are Hebrew and not Aramaic (the Aramaic equivalent would be Yitrabay veyitkadash), some authorities (but not others) felt that both words should be rendered in pure Hebrew pronunciation.Scherman, Nosson, The Kaddish Prayer: A new translation with a commentary anthologized from Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic Sources (Brooklyn, Mesorah Publ'ns, 3rd ed. 1991) page 28; Nulman, Macy, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (Aronson, NJ, 1993) s.v. Kaddish, pages 185–186; see also the pointed Hebrew translations of the Kaddish in the Siddur Rinat Yisroel (Jerusalem, 1977) Ashkenaz ed. page 40, and in Rosenstein, Siddur Shirah Hadasha (Eshkol, Jerusalem, no date, reprinted circa 1945 – but original edition was 1914) page 38; Silverman, Morris, Comments on the Text of the Siddur, Journal of Jewish Music & Liturgy, vol. 2, nr. 1 (1977–78) page 21. \n* (c) Line 13: in the Ashkenazi tradition the repeated \"le'ela\" is used only during the Ten Days of Repentance. In the Sephardi tradition it is never used. In the Yemenite tradition it is the invariable wording. The phrase \"le'ela le'ela\" is the Targum's translation of the Hebrew \"ma'la ma'la\" (Deuteronomy 28:43). \n* (d) Lines 4 and 30–32 are not present in the Ashkenazi tradition. \"Revaḥ vehatzala\" is said aloud by the congregation.\n* (e) Line 26: some Sephardi Jews say malka [or maram or mareh] di-shmaya ve-ar'a (the King [or Master] of Heaven and Earth) instead of avuhon de-vi-shmaya (their Father in Heaven); De Sola Pool uses mara; the London Spanish and Portuguese Jews use the same text as the Ashkenazim.Silverman, Morris, Comments on the Text of the Siddur, Journal of Jewish Music & Liturgy, vol. 2, nr. 1 (1977–78) page 21. \n* (f) During the \"complete kaddish\" some include the following congregational responses, which are not regarded as part of the text:\n** Before line 16, \"accept our prayer with mercy and favour\"\n** Before line 28, \"May the name of God be blessed, from now and forever\" ()\n** Before line 34, \"My help is from God, creator of heaven and earth\" ()\n* (g) Line 35: \"b'rahamav\" is used by Sephardim in all versions of kaddish; by Ashkenazim only in \"Kaddish deRabbanan\".\n* (h) Line 36: \"ammo\" is used by most Sephardim, but not by some of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews or Ashkenazim. \n* (i) Lines 37 to 45: these lines are also recited by Yemenite Jews as part of every Kaddish DeRabbanan. \n* (z) In line 22, the bracketed word is added in the Land of Israel.\n* In line 1, as noted in (a), the congregation responds \"Amen\", even though this commonly is not printed in most prayerbooks.  This longstanding and widespread tradition actually introduces a break in the verse which may lead to misinterpretation as the phrase \"according to His will\" would then appear to apply only to \"which he created\" instead of to \"Magnified and sanctified\".Mishcon, A., Disputed Phrasings in the Siddur, Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 7 n.s., nr. 4 (April 1917) page 545.\n* It is common that the entire congregation recites lines 8 and 9 with the leader, and it is also common that the congregation will include in its collective recitation the first word of the next line (line 10), Yitbarakh.  This is commonly thought to be done to prevent any interruption before the next line (which begins with Yitbarakh) is recited by the leader. But this inclusion of Yitbarakh has not always been the case. Maimonides and the Tur did not include it in the congregation's recitation; Amram Gaon, the Vilna Gaon, and the Shulchan Aruch include it.Mishcon, A., Disputed Phrasings in the Siddur, Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 7 n.s., nr. 4 (April 1917) pages 545–546;  Nulman, Macy, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (Aronson, NJ, 1993) s.v. Kaddish, page 186.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe Kaddish, as used in the services on special days is chanted. There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version, the day it is said and even the position in the service; many mourners recite it slowly and contemplatively.\n*[http://www.virtualcantor.com/162%20musaf%20kaddish%20shalem.mp3 Virtual Cantor's Kaddish Shalem for Shabbat Mussaf]\n*[http://www.virtualcantor.com/483%20RMus%20chatzi%20kaddish.mp3 Virtual Cantor's Hatzi Kaddish for Yom Kippur]\n\nIn Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish, except:\n*during the Kaddish immediately before the Amidah, where everyone stands;\n*during the Mourner's Kaddish, where those reciting it stand and everyone else sits.\n\nIn Ashkenazi synagogues, the custom varies. Very commonly, in both Orthodox and Reform congregations, everyone stands; but in some (especially many Conservative and Hasidic) synagogues, most of the congregants sit. Sometimes, a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish, or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom. The Mourner's Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service, as is the Half Kaddish before the maftir.\n\nThose standing to recite the Kaddish bow, by widespread tradition, at various places. Generally: At the first word of the prayer, at each Amen, at Yitbarakh, at Brikh hu, and for the last verse (Oseh shalom). For Oseh shalom it is customary take three steps back (if possible) then bow to one's left, then to one's right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.H.D. Assaf, Kaddish: Its origins, meanings and laws (Maimonides Research Inst., Haifa, 1966) 2003 English ed. pages 228–233; M. Nulman, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer  (Aronson, NJ, 1993) page 186.\n\nMinyan requirement\n\nMasekhet Soferim, an eighth-century compilation of Jewish laws regarding the preparation of holy books and public reading, states (Chapter 10:7) that Kaddish may be recited only in the presence of a minyan (at least 10 men).  While the traditional view is that \"if kaddish is said in private, then by definition it is not kaddish,\" some alternatives have been suggested, including the Kaddish L'yachid (\"Kaddish for an individual\"), attributed to ninth-century Gaon Amram bar Sheshna, and the use of kavanah prayer, asking heavenly beings to join with the individual \"to make a minyan of both Earth and heaven\".\n\nMourner's Kaddish\n\n\"Mourner's Kaddish\" is said at all prayer services and certain other occasions. It is written in Aramaic.[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1737300/jewish/Why-is-the-Kaddish-Recited-in-Aramaic.htm \"Why is the Kaddish in Aramaic?\"] chabad.org It takes the form of Kaddish Yehe Shelama Rabba, and is traditionally recited several times, most prominently at or towards the end of the service, after the Aleinu and/or closing Psalms and/or (on the Sabbath) Ani'im Zemirot. Following the death of a parent, child, spouse, or sibling it is customary to recite the Mourner's Kaddish in the presence of a congregation daily for thirty days, or eleven months in the case of a parent, and then at every anniversary of the death.[http://kaddish-prayer.com/yahrzeit/  Yahrzeit Customs] kaddish-prayer.com The \"mourner\" who says the Kaddish will be any person present at a service who has the obligation to recite Kaddish in accordance with these rules.\n\nCustoms for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish at the end of the service.\n\nSaying the Mourner's Kaddish was mostly prohibited for Orthodox Jewish women, but is now becoming more common.[http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/11/22/more-orthodox-women-saying-the-kaddish.html Orthodox Women Embrace The Kaddish] thedailybeast.com In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents.\n\nIt is important to note that the Mourner's Kaddish does not mention death at all, but instead praises God. Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the \"Jewish Prayer for the Dead,\" that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called \"El Malei Rachamim\", which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased.\n\nUse of the Kaddish in the arts\n\nThe Kaddish has been a particularly common theme and reference point in the arts, including the following:\n\nIn literature and publications\n\n(Alphabetical by author)\n\n* In Shai Afsai’s \"[http://401j.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-kaddish-a-short-story/ The Kaddish],\" a poignant short story that could happen in almost any town with a small Jewish community, a group of elderly men trying to form a minyan in order to recite the Kaddish confront the differences between Judaism’s denominations.Shai Afsai, \"[http://401j.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-kaddish-a-short-story/ The Kaddish],\" Jerusalem Post, Aug. 27, 2010.  \n*Kaddish is a poem, divided into 21 sections and of almost 700 pages length, by German poet Paulus Böhmer.

The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God's name. In the liturgy, different versions of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between sections of the service.\n\nThe term \"Kaddish\" is often used to refer specifically to \"The Mourner's Kaddish\", said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services, as well as at funerals (other than at the gravesite, see Qaddish aḥar Haqqəvurah \"Qaddish after Burial\") and memorials, and for 11 months after the death of a close relative. When mention is made of \"saying Kaddish\", this unambiguously refers to the rituals of mourning. Mourners say Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God.\n\nThe opening words of this prayer are inspired by , a vision of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations. The central line of the Kaddish in Jewish tradition is the congregation's response:  (Yǝhē šmēh rabbā mǝvārakh lǝʿālam u-lʿalmē ʿālmayyā, \"May His great name be blessed for ever, and to all eternity\"), a public declaration of God's greatness and eternality. This response is an Aramaic translation of the Hebrew \"\" (Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever), which is to be found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (, Genesis 49:2 and Deuteronomy 6:4), and is similar to the wording of .\n\nThe Mourners, Rabbis and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace (\"Oseh Shalom...\"), which is in Hebrew, and is somewhat similar to the Tanakh .\n\nAlong with the Shema Yisrael and Amidah, the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy. Kaddish cannot be recited alone. Along with some prayers, it can only be recited with a minyan of ten Jews.\n\nHistory and background\n\n\"The Kaddish is in origin a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse.\"Pool, D. de S., The Kaddish, Sivan Press, Ltd, Jerusalem, 1909, (3rd printing, 1964). (see David de Sola Pool) Most of it is written in Aramaic, which, at the time of its original composition, was the lingua franca of the Jewish people. It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic, however, but rather in a \"literary, jargon Aramaic\" that was used in the academies, and is identical to the dialect of the Targum.\n\nThe oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon, c. 900. Shira Schoenberg observes that \"The first mention of mourners saying Kaddish at the end of the service is in a 13th century halakhic writing by Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, the Or Zarua (\"Light is Sown\"). The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner's Kaddish (literally, \"Orphan's Kaddish\").\n\nVariant forms\n\nThe various versions of the Kaddish are:\n* Ḥaṣi Qaddish (חצי קדיש) or Qaddish Lʿela (קדיש לעלא)Literally \"Half Kaddish\", sometimes called the \"Reader's Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish Yatom (קדיש יתום) or Qaddish Yehe Shlama Rabba (קדיש יהא שלמא רבא)Literally \"Orphan's Kaddish\", although commonly referred to as Qaddish Avelim (קדיש אבלים), the \"Mourner's Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish Shalem (קדיש שלם) or Qaddish Titkabbal (קדיש תתקבל)Literally \"Complete Kaddish\" or \"Whole Kaddish\"\n* Qaddish de Rabbanan (קדיש דרבנן) or Qaddish ʿal Yisraʾel (קדיש על ישראל)Literally \"Kaddish of the Rabbis\"\n* Qaddish aḥar Haqqvura (קדיש אחר הקבורה)Literally \"Kaddish after a Burial\", also called Kaddish d'Ithadata (קדיש דאתחדתא) named after one of the first distinguishing words in this variant.\n* Qaddish aḥar Hashlamat Masechet (קדיש אחר השלמת מסכת)Literally, \"Kaddish after the completion of a tractate,\" i.e. at a siyum (in Sefardi practice, same as Qaddish de Rabbanan), also called Qaddish haGadol (קדיש הגדול) \"the Great Qaddish\", as it is the longest Kaddish.\n\nAll versions of the Kaddish begin with the Hatzi Kaddish (there are some extra passages in the Kaddish after a burial or a siyum). The longer versions contain additional paragraphs, and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs.\n\nThe Half Kaddish is used to punctuate divisions within the service: for example, before Barechu, between the Shema Yisrael and the Amidah and following readings from the Torah. The Kaddish d'Rabbanan is used after any part of the service that includes extracts from the Mishnah or the Talmud, as its original purpose was to close a study session.  Kaddish Titkabbal originally marked the end of the service, though in later times extra passages and hymns were added to follow it.\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedias article on Kaddish mentions an additional type of Kaddish, called Qaddish Yahid \"Individual's Kaddish\". This is included in the Siddur of Amram Gaon, but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense.\n\nText of the Kaddish\n\nThe following includes the half, complete, mourner's and rabbi's kaddish. The variant lines of the kaddish after a burial or a siyum are given below.\n\nText of the burial kaddish\n\nIn the burial kaddish, and that after a siyum according to Ashkenazim,i, lines 2-3 are replaced by:\n\nRecent additions to Oseh Shalom\n\nIn some recent prayerbooks, for example, the American Reform Machzor, line 36 is replaced with:\n\nThis effort to extend the reach of Oseh Shalom to non-Jews is said to have been started by the British Liberal Jewish movement in 1967, with the introduction of v'al kol bnai Adam (\"and upon all children of Adam\"); these words continue to be used by some in the UK.\n\nNOTE: The phrase בן אדם (ben adam) pl. בני אדם (bnai adam) literally means \"son of adam\" or \"son of man\" but in Hebrew usage the phrase is taken to mean \"human.\" The British usage above, then would be to invoke peace on all humankind, rather than on sons of children or descendants of Adam.\n\nNotes \n\n* Bracketed text varies according to personal or communal traditions.\n* (a) The congregation responds with \"amen\" (אָמֵן) after lines 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 27, 33, 36. In the Ashkenazi tradition, the response to line 12 is \"Blessed be he\" (בְּרִיךְ הוּא b'rikh hu).\n* (b) On line 1, some say Yitgaddeyl veyitqaddeysh rather than Yitgaddal veyitqaddash, because the roots of these two words are Hebrew and not Aramaic (the Aramaic equivalent would be Yitrabay veyitkadash), some authorities (but not others) felt that both words should be rendered in pure Hebrew pronunciation.Scherman, Nosson, The Kaddish Prayer: A new translation with a commentary anthologized from Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic Sources (Brooklyn, Mesorah Publ'ns, 3rd ed. 1991) page 28; Nulman, Macy, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (Aronson, NJ, 1993) s.v. Kaddish, pages 185–186; see also the pointed Hebrew translations of the Kaddish in the Siddur Rinat Yisroel (Jerusalem, 1977) Ashkenaz ed. page 40, and in Rosenstein, Siddur Shirah Hadasha (Eshkol, Jerusalem, no date, reprinted circa 1945 – but original edition was 1914) page 38; Silverman, Morris, Comments on the Text of the Siddur, Journal of Jewish Music & Liturgy, vol. 2, nr. 1 (1977–78) page 21. \n* (c) Line 13: in the Ashkenazi tradition the repeated \"le'ela\" is used only during the Ten Days of Repentance. In the Sephardi tradition it is never used. In the Yemenite tradition it is the invariable wording. The phrase \"le'ela le'ela\" is the Targum's translation of the Hebrew \"ma'la ma'la\" (Deuteronomy 28:43). \n* (d) Lines 4 and 30–32 are not present in the Ashkenazi tradition. \"Revaḥ vehatzala\" is said aloud by the congregation.\n* (e) Line 26: some Sephardi Jews say malka [or maram or mareh] di-shmaya ve-ar'a (the King [or Master] of Heaven and Earth) instead of avuhon de-vi-shmaya (their Father in Heaven); De Sola Pool uses mara; the London Spanish and Portuguese Jews use the same text as the Ashkenazim.Silverman, Morris, Comments on the Text of the Siddur, Journal of Jewish Music & Liturgy, vol. 2, nr. 1 (1977–78) page 21. \n* (f) During the \"complete kaddish\" some include the following congregational responses, which are not regarded as part of the text:\n** Before line 16, \"accept our prayer with mercy and favour\"\n** Before line 28, \"May the name of God be blessed, from now and forever\" ()\n** Before line 34, \"My help is from God, creator of heaven and earth\" ()\n* (g) Line 35: \"b'rahamav\" is used by Sephardim in all versions of kaddish; by Ashkenazim only in \"Kaddish deRabbanan\".\n* (h) Line 36: \"ammo\" is used by most Sephardim, but not by some of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews or Ashkenazim. \n* (i) Lines 37 to 45: these lines are also recited by Yemenite Jews as part of every Kaddish DeRabbanan. \n* (z) In line 22, the bracketed word is added in the Land of Israel.\n* In line 1, as noted in (a), the congregation responds \"Amen\", even though this commonly is not printed in most prayerbooks.  This longstanding and widespread tradition actually introduces a break in the verse which may lead to misinterpretation as the phrase \"according to His will\" would then appear to apply only to \"which he created\" instead of to \"Magnified and sanctified\".Mishcon, A., Disputed Phrasings in the Siddur, Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 7 n.s., nr. 4 (April 1917) page 545.\n* It is common that the entire congregation recites lines 8 and 9 with the leader, and it is also common that the congregation will include in its collective recitation the first word of the next line (line 10), Yitbarakh.  This is commonly thought to be done to prevent any interruption before the next line (which begins with Yitbarakh) is recited by the leader. But this inclusion of Yitbarakh has not always been the case. Maimonides and the Tur did not include it in the congregation's recitation; Amram Gaon, the Vilna Gaon, and the Shulchan Aruch include it.Mishcon, A., Disputed Phrasings in the Siddur, Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 7 n.s., nr. 4 (April 1917) pages 545–546;  Nulman, Macy, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (Aronson, NJ, 1993) s.v. Kaddish, page 186.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe Kaddish, as used in the services on special days is chanted. There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version, the day it is said and even the position in the service; many mourners recite it slowly and contemplatively.\n*[http://www.virtualcantor.com/162%20musaf%20kaddish%20shalem.mp3 Virtual Cantor's Kaddish Shalem for Shabbat Mussaf]\n*[http://www.virtualcantor.com/483%20RMus%20chatzi%20kaddish.mp3 Virtual Cantor's Hatzi Kaddish for Yom Kippur]\n\nIn Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish, except:\n*during the Kaddish immediately before the Amidah, where everyone stands;\n*during the Mourner's Kaddish, where those reciting it stand and everyone else sits.\n\nIn Ashkenazi synagogues, the custom varies. Very commonly, in both Orthodox and Reform congregations, everyone stands; but in some (especially many Conservative and Hasidic) synagogues, most of the congregants sit. Sometimes, a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish, or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom. The Mourner's Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service, as is the Half Kaddish before the maftir.\n\nThose standing to recite the Kaddish bow, by widespread tradition, at various places. Generally: At the first word of the prayer, at each Amen, at Yitbarakh, at Brikh hu, and for the last verse (Oseh shalom). For Oseh shalom it is customary take three steps back (if possible) then bow to one's left, then to one's right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.H.D. Assaf, Kaddish: Its origins, meanings and laws (Maimonides Research Inst., Haifa, 1966) 2003 English ed. pages 228–233; M. Nulman, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer  (Aronson, NJ, 1993) page 186.\n\nMinyan requirement\n\nMasekhet Soferim, an eighth-century compilation of Jewish laws regarding the preparation of holy books and public reading, states (Chapter 10:7) that Kaddish may be recited only in the presence of a minyan (at least 10 men).  While the traditional view is that \"if kaddish is said in private, then by definition it is not kaddish,\" some alternatives have been suggested, including the Kaddish L'yachid (\"Kaddish for an individual\"), attributed to ninth-century Gaon Amram bar Sheshna, and the use of kavanah prayer, asking heavenly beings to join with the individual \"to make a minyan of both Earth and heaven\".\n\nMourner's Kaddish\n\n\"Mourner's Kaddish\" is said at all prayer services and certain other occasions. It is written in Aramaic.[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1737300/jewish/Why-is-the-Kaddish-Recited-in-Aramaic.htm \"Why is the Kaddish in Aramaic?\"] chabad.org It takes the form of Kaddish Yehe Shelama Rabba, and is traditionally recited several times, most prominently at or towards the end of the service, after the Aleinu and/or closing Psalms and/or (on the Sabbath) Ani'im Zemirot. Following the death of a parent, child, spouse, or sibling it is customary to recite the Mourner's Kaddish in the presence of a congregation daily for thirty days, or eleven months in the case of a parent, and then at every anniversary of the death.[http://kaddish-prayer.com/yahrzeit/  Yahrzeit Customs] kaddish-prayer.com The \"mourner\" who says the Kaddish will be any person present at a service who has the obligation to recite Kaddish in accordance with these rules.\n\nCustoms for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish at the end of the service.\n\nSaying the Mourner's Kaddish was mostly prohibited for Orthodox Jewish women, but is now becoming more common.[http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/11/22/more-orthodox-women-saying-the-kaddish.html Orthodox Women Embrace The Kaddish] thedailybeast.com In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents.\n\nIt is important to note that the Mourner's Kaddish does not mention death at all, but instead praises God. Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the \"Jewish Prayer for the Dead,\" that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called \"El Malei Rachamim\", which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased.\n\nUse of the Kaddish in the arts\n\nThe Kaddish has been a particularly common theme and reference point in the arts, including the following:\n\nIn literature and publications\n\n(Alphabetical by author)\n\n* In Shai Afsai’s \"[http://401j.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-kaddish-a-short-story/ The Kaddish],\" a poignant short story that could happen in almost any town with a small Jewish community, a group of elderly men trying to form a minyan in order to recite the Kaddish confront the differences between Judaism’s denominations.Shai Afsai, \"[http://401j.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-kaddish-a-short-story/ The Kaddish],\" Jerusalem Post, Aug. 27, 2010.  \n*Kaddish is a poem, divided into 21 sections and of almost 700 pages length, by German poet Paulus Böhmer.
