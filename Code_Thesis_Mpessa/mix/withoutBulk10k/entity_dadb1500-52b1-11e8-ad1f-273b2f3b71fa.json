  "textBody" : "In architecture, a cupola is a relatively small, most often dome-like, tall structure on top of a building. Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air, it usually crowns a larger roof or dome.\n\nThe word derives, via Italian, from the lower Latin cupula (classical Latin cupella from the Greek κύπελλον kupellon) \"small cup\" (Latin cupa) indicating a vault resembling an upside down cup.In Italian cupola simply means dome, and the ornamental top element is called lanterna.\n  \nThe cupola is a development during the Renaissance of the oculus, an ancient device found in Roman architecture, but being weatherproof was superior for the wetter climates of northern Europe.
