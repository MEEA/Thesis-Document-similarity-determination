  "textBody" : "Minerva (;; Etruscan: Menrva) was the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, though it is noted that the Romans did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the Greeks would come to, and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. \n\nFollowing the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor.Encarta World English Dictionary 1998–2004 Microsoft Corporation. After impregnating the titaness Metis notably forcefully which resulted in her attempting to change shape or shapeshift to escape him, Jupiter recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had Cronus and in turn, Cronus had Uranus. \n\nFearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body nevertheless. It is said in some versions that Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind and that she is the source of his wisdom though others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. Nevertheless, the constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain and to relieve the pain, Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armor.\n\nShe was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the \"owl of Minerva\",Philosophy of Right (1820), \"Preface\" which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge as well as, less frequently, the snake and the olive tree.\n\nWorship in Rome and Italy\n\nMinerva was worshipped at several locations in Rome, including most prominently as part of the Capitoline Triad, and also at the Temple of Minerva Medica, and at the \"Delubrum Minervae\", a temple founded around 50 BC by Pompey on the site now occupied by the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.\n\nThe Romans celebrated her festival from March 19 to March 23 during the day which is called, in the neuter plural, Quinquatria, the fifth after the Ides of March, the nineteenth, an artisans' holiday. A lesser version, the Minusculae Quinquatria, was held on the Ides of June, June 13, by the flute-players, who were particularly useful to religion. In 207 BC, a guild of poets and actors was formed to meet and make votive offerings at the temple of Minerva on the Aventine Hill. Among others, its members included Livius Andronicus. The Aventine sanctuary of Minerva continued to be an important center of the arts for much of the middle Roman Republic.\n\nAs Minerva Medica, she was the goddess of medicine and physicians. As Minerva Achaea, she was worshipped at Lucera in Apulia where votive gifts and arms said to be those of Diomedes were preserved in her temple.Aristotle Mirab. Narrat. 117\n\nHer worship also was spread throughout the empire. In Britain, for example, she was syncretized with the local goddess Sulis, who often was invoked for restitution for theft.\n\nIn Fasti III, Ovid called her the \"goddess of a thousand works\". Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, and when she eventually became equated with the Greek goddess Athena, she also became a goddess of battle. Unlike Mars, god of war, she was sometimes portrayed with sword lowered, in sympathy for the recent dead, rather than raised in triumph and battle lust. In Rome her bellicose nature was emphasized less than elsewhere. \n\nRoman coinage\n\nMinerva is featured on the coinage of different Roman Emperors. She often is represented on the reverse side of a coin holding an owl and a spear among her attributes.\n\nEtruscan Menrva\n\nStemming from an Italic moon goddess *Meneswā ('She who measures'), the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name, *Menerwā, thereby calling her Menrva. It is presumed that her Roman name, Minerva, is based on this Etruscan mythology. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to Greek Athena. Like Athena, Minerva burst from the head of her father, Jupiter (Greek Zeus), who had devoured her mother (Metis) in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent her birth.\n\nBy a process of folk etymology, the Romans could have linked her foreign name to the root men- in Latin words such as mens meaning \"mind\", perhaps because one of her aspects as goddess pertained to the intellectual. The word mens is built from the Proto-Indo-European root *men- 'mind' (linked with memory as in Greek Mnemosyne/μνημοσύνη and mnestis/μνῆστις: memory, remembrance, recollection, manush in Sanskrit meaning mind).\n\nThe Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy triad with Tinia and Uni, equivalent to the Roman Capitoline Triad of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.\n\nUniversities and educational establishments\n\nAs a patron goddess of wisdom, Minerva frequently features in statuary, as an image on seals, and in other forms at educational institutions.\n\nUse by societies and governments\n\n*The Seal of California depicts the Goddess Minerva. Her birth fully-grown parallels California becoming a state without first being a territory.\n*In the early twentieth century, Manuel José Estrada Cabrera, President of Guatemala, tried to promote a \"Worship  of Minerva\" in his country; this left little legacy other than a few interesting Hellenic style \"Temples\" in parks around Guatemala.\n*According to John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy (1798), the third degree of the Bavarian Illuminati was called Minerval or Brother of Minerva, in honour of the goddess of learning. Later, this title was adopted for the first initiation of Aleister Crowley's OTO rituals.\n* Minerva is displayed on the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government.\n* Minerva is featured in the logo of the Max Planck Society.\n* Minerva alongside Mars is displayed on the cap badge of the Artists Rifles Territorial SAS Regiment of the British Army. \n* Kingston upon Hull's oldest Masonic lodge is named The Minerva Lodge.\n* Minerva is the patron goddess of the Theta Delta Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities, the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and the Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Sigma Theta sororities\n* LSV Minerva is the oldest student society in the Netherlands and strongly related to Leiden University.\n* Minerva Schools at KGI is an innovative global four-year undergraduate program that took their name from Minerva.\n\nPublic monuments, places, and modern culture\n\n* A statue of Minerva is displayed by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and is the university's new graphic identity starting 2004.\n* A small Roman shrine to Minerva stands in Handbridge, Chester. It sits in a public park, overlooking the River Dee.\n* A statue to Minerva was designed by John Charles Felix Rossi to adorn the Town Hall of Liverpool, where it has stood since 1799.
