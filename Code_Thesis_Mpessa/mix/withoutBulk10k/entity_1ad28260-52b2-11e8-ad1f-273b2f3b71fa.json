  "textBody" : "Indigo is a deep and rich color close to the color wheel blue (a primary color in the RGB color space), as well as to some variants of ultramarine. It is traditionally regarded as a color in the visible spectrum, as well as one of the seven colors of the rainbow: the color between purple and blue; however, sources differ as to its actual position in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe color indigo is named after the indigo dye derived from the plant Indigofera tinctoria and related species.\n\nThe first known recorded use of indigo as a color name in English was in 1289.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 197; Color Sample of Indigo: Page 117 Plate 47 Color Sample E10\n\nHistory \n\nSpecies of Indigofera were cultivated in East Asia, Egypt, India, and Peru in antiquity. The earliest direct evidence for the use of indigo dates to around 4000 BCE and comes from Huaca Prieta, in contemporary Peru. Pliny the Elder mentions the Indus Valley Civilization as the source of the dye after which it was named. It was imported from there in small quantities via the Silk Road.Robin J. H. Clark, Christopher J. Cooksey, Marcus A. M. Daniels, Robert Withnall: \"Indigo, woad, and Tyrian Purple: important vat dyes from antiquity to the present\", Endeavour 17/4 (1993), 191–199.\nThe Ancient Greek term for the dye was   (\"Sindhi dye\"), which, adopted to Latin as indicum and via Portuguese gave rise to the modern word indigo.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfa%2Frmakon Ἰνδικός] in Henry George Liddell. Robert Scott. A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by. Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford. Clarendon Press. 1940; English indigo since the 17th century, changed from 16th-century indico.\n\nIndigo was actually a plant that got its name because it came from the Indus Valley Civilisation, discovered some 5,000 years ago, where it was called nila, meaning dark blue. And by the 7th Century BC, people started using the plant as a dye; the Mesopotamians were even carving out recipes for making indigo dye onto clay tablets for record-keeping. By 1289, knowledge of the dye made its way to Europe, when the Venetian merchant traveler Marco Polo reported on it.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until 1640 when demand started to pick up for indigo. Spanish explorers discovered an American species of indigo and began to cultivate the product in  Guatemala. The English and French subsequently began to encourage indigo cultivation in their colonies in the West Indies.\n\nIndigo dye could be made from two different types of plants: the indigo plant, which produced the best results, and from the woad plant. The British were producing indigo with woad, a plant that yielded a lesser quality dye, but a plant they could grow. They even tried to hold their monopoly on indigo dye by managing to ban the indigo plant for years, claiming that it was poisonous. But eventually the British began to focus on tea and other crops, and meanwhile, the French started to get their fair share of the market.\n\nBut this was problematic. The French had gone to war with Britain, so the British could hardly rely on the French for this precious blue dye. Consequently, the British had to turn to their colonies in America. It was Eliza Lucas from South Carolina who figured out how to grow the indigo plant and use it to make indigo cakes that would support British demand.\n\nThe same indigo dye is contained in the woad plant, Isatis tinctoria, for a long time the main source of blue dye in Europe. Woad was replaced by true indigo as trade routes opened up, and both plant sources have now been largely replaced by synthetic dyes.\n\nClassification as a spectral color \n\nThe Early Modern English word indigo referred to the dye, not to the color (hue) itself, and indigo is not traditionally part of the basic color-naming system. Modern sources place indigo in the electromagnetic spectrum between 420 and 450 nanometers, which lies on the short-wave side of color wheel (RGB) blue, towards (spectral) violet.\n\nHowever, the correspondence of this definition with colors of actual indigo dyes is disputed. Optical scientists Hardy and Perrin list indigo as between 445 and 464 nm wavelength,Arthur C. Hardy and Fred H. Perrin.

In the mid-1660s, when Newton bought a pair of prisms at a fair near Cambridge, the East India Company had begun importing indigo dye into England, supplanting the homegrown woad as source of blue dye. In a pivotal experiment in the history of optics, the young Newton shone a narrow beam of sunlight through a prism to produce a rainbow-like band of colors on the wall. In describing this optical spectrum, Newton acknowledged that the spectrum had a continuum of colors, but named seven: \"The originall or primary colours are Red, yellow, Green, Blew, & a violet purple; together with Orang, Indico, & an indefinite varietie of intermediate gradations.\"Newton's draft of [http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00003 A Theory Concerning Light and Colors] on newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk He linked the seven prismatic colors to the seven notes of a western major scale, as shown in his color wheel, with orange and indigo as the semitones. Having decided upon seven colors, he asked a friend to repeatedly divide up the spectrum that was projected from the prism onto the wall:\n\nI desired a friend to draw with a pencil lines cross the image, or pillar of colours, where every one of the seven aforenamed colours was most full and brisk, and also where he judged the truest confines of them to be, whilst I held the paper so, that the said image might fall within a certain compass marked on it. And this I did, partly because my own eyes are not very critical in distinguishing colours, partly because another, to whom I had not communicated my thoughts about this matter, could have nothing but his eyes to determine his fancy in making those marks.\n\nIndigo is therefore counted as one of the traditional colors of the rainbow, the order of which is given by the mnemonic Roy G. Biv. James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz accepted indigo as an appropriate name for the color flanking violet in the spectrum.\n\nLater scientists conclude that Newton named the colors differently from current usage.\nAccording to Gary Waldman, \"A careful reading of Newton's work indicates that the color he called indigo, we would normally call blue; his blue is then what we would name blue-green, cyan or light blue.\" If this is true, Newton's seven spectral colors would have been:\nRed: Orange: Yellow: Green: Blue: Indigo: Violet:\n\nThe human eye does not readily differentiate hues in the wavelengths between what we today call blue and violet. If this is where Newton meant indigo to lie, most individuals would have difficulty distinguishing indigo from its neighbors. According to Isaac Asimov, \"It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet, but it has never seemed to me that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color. To my eyes it seems merely deep blue.\"\n\nModern color scientists typically divide the spectrum between violet and blue at about 450 nm, with no indigo.\n\nDistinction among the four major tones of indigo \n\nLike many other colors (orange, rose, and violet are the best-known), indigo gets its name from an object in the natural world—the plant named indigo once used for dyeing cloth (see also Indigo dye).\n\nThe color electric indigo is a bright and saturated color between the traditional indigo and violet. This is the brightest color indigo that can be approximated on a computer screen; it is a color located between the (primary) blue and the color violet of the RGB color wheel.\n\nThe web color blue violet or deep indigo is a tone of indigo brighter than pigment indigo, but not as bright as electric indigo.\n\nThe color pigment indigo is equivalent to the web color indigo and approximates the color indigo that is usually reproduced in pigments and colored pencils.\n\nThe color of indigo dye is a different color from either spectrum indigo or pigment indigo. This is the actual color of the dye. A vat full of this dye is a darker color, approximating the web color midnight blue.\n\nBelow are displayed these four major tones of indigo.\n\nElectric indigo \n\n\"Electric indigo\" is brighter than the pigment indigo reproduced below. When plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram, this color is at 435 nanometers, in the middle of the portion of the spectrum traditionally considered indigo, i.e., between 450 and 420 nanometers. This color is only an approximation of spectral indigo, since actual spectral colors are outside the gamut of the sRGB color system.\n\nDeep indigo (web color blue-violet) \n\nAt right is displayed the web color \"blue-violet\", a color intermediate in brightness between electric indigo and pigment indigo. It is also known as \"deep indigo\".\n\nLight indigo (web color indigo) \n\nThe color box at right displays the web color indigo which is equivalent to \"light indigo\", the color indigo as it would be reproduced by artists' paints as opposed to the brighter indigo above (electric indigo) that is possible to reproduce on a computer screen. Its hue is closer to violet than to indigo dye for which the color is named. Pigment indigo can be obtained by mixing 55% pigment cyan with about 45% pigment magenta.\n\nCompare the subtractive colors to the additive colors in the two primary color charts in the article on primary colors to see the distinction between electric colors as reproducible from light on a computer screen (additive colors) and the pigment colors reproducible with pigments (subtractive colors); the additive colors are significantly brighter because they are produced from light instead of pigment.\n\nLight indigo (web color indigo) represents the way the color indigo was always reproduced in pigments, paints, or colored pencils in the 1950s. By the 1970s, because of the advent of psychedelic art, artists became used to brighter pigments, and pigments called \"bright indigo\" or \"bright blue-violet\" that are the pigment equivalent of the electric indigo reproduced in the section above became available in artists' pigments and colored pencils.\n\nTropical indigo \n\n'Tropical Indigo' is the color that is called añil in the Guía de coloraciones (Guide to colorations) by Rosa Gallego and\nJuan Carlos Sanz, a color dictionary published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.\n\nOther Indigo colors \n\nIndigo Dye \n\nThe Indigo Dye is greenish dark blue color which is close to real indigo dye.\n\nIn nature \n\n;Birds\n* Male indigobirds are a very dark, metallic blue.\n* The indigo bunting, native to North America, is mostly bright cerulean blue with an indigo head. \n*The related blue grosbeak is, ironically, more indigo than the indigo bunting.\n;Fungi\n* Lactarius indigo is one of the very few species of mushrooms colored in tones of blue.\n;Snakes\n* The eastern indigo snake, Drymarchon couperi, of the southeastern United States, is a dark blue/black.\n\nIn culture \n\nLiterature\n\nMarina Warner's novel Indigo (1992) is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest and features the production of indigo dye by Sycorax.\n\nBusiness \n\n* IndiGo Airlines is an Indian budget airline that uses an indigo logo and operates only Airbus A320s.\n* Indigo Books and Music uses an indigo logo and has sometimes referred to the color as \"blue\" in advertising.\"It's New and It's Blue\" (Indigo advertisement), Globe and Mail, Toronto, October 1, 1999, p. A3\"Indigo Bookstore had a 'Think Blue' campaign back in 1999\" according to: \n* Indigo Dreams is an award-winning publishing company based in Devon, England.\n* Indigo Line, a proposed MBTA commuter rail line, is set to open in 2024.\n* The Indigo Tribe is a Los Angeles based home accessories company that uses natural indigo as its main dyeing agent.\n\nComputer graphics \n\n* Electric indigo is sometimes used as a glow color for computer graphics lighting, possibly because it seems to change color from indigo to lavender when blended with white.\n\nDyes \n\n* Guatemala, as of 1778, was considered one of the world's foremost providers of indigo.\n* In Mexico, indigo is known as 'añil'.Gallego, Rosa; Sanz, Juan Carlos (2001).
