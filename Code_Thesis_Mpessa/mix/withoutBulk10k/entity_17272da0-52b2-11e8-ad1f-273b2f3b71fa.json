  "textBody" : "Italy is located in southern Europe and comprises the long, boot-shaped Italian Peninsula, the southern side of Alps, the large plain of the Po Valley and some islands including Sicily and Sardinia. Corsica, although belonging to the Italian geographical region, has been a part of France since 1769. Italy is part of the Eastern Hemisphere.\n\nIts total area is , of which  is land and . It lies between latitudes 35° and 48° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E.\n\nItaly borders Switzerland (698 km), France (476 km), Austria (404 km) and Slovenia (218 km). San Marino (37 km) and Vatican city () are enclaves.\n\nIncluding islands, Italy has a coastline of  on the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Sea of Sardinia and Strait of Sicily.\n\nMountains and plains\n\nAlmost 40% of the Italian territory is mountainous, with the Alps as the northern boundary and the Apennine Mountains forming the backbone of the peninsula and extending for 1350 km. In between the two lies a large plain in the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows 652 km eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with , and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.\n\nThe Alpine mountain range is linked with the Apennines with the Colle di Cadibona pass in the Ligurian Alps.\n\nWorldwide-known mountains in Italy are Monte Cervino (Matterhorn), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Italy is Mont Blanc, at 4810 meters above sea level.\n\nVolcanoes\n\nMany elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like Capraia, Ponza, Ischia, Eolie, Ustica and Pantelleria are volcanic islands.\nThere are also active volcanoes: Etna, in Sicily, the largest active volcano in Europe; Vulcano, Stromboli, and Vesuvius, near Naples, the only active volcano on mainland Europe.\n\nRivers and seas\n\nMost of Italy's rivers drain either into the Adriatic Sea (like Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) or into the Tyrrhenian (like Arno, Tiber and Volturno), though the waters from some border municipalities (Livigno in Lombardy, Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Drava, a tributary of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of the Rhine.\n\nMaritime claims\n\n* Territorial sea: 12 nmi\n* Continental shelf: 200 m or to the depth of exploitation\n\nLakes\n\nIn the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda (370 km2). Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore (), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como (146 km2), Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro.\n\nOther notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are Trasimeno, Bolsena, Bracciano, Vico, Varano and Lesina in Gargano and Omodeo in Sardinia.\n\nIslands\n\nItaly includes several islands. The largest are Sicily 25708 km2 and Sardinia 24090 km2.
