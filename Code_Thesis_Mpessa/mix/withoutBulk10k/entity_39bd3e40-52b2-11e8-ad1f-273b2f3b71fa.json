There are over 30,000km of roads, but much of the network is unpaved. \n\nOn the Indian Ocean coast are several large seaports, including Nacala, Beira and Maputo, with further ports being developed.

The railroads were major targets during the Mozambican Civil War, were sabotaged by RENAMO, and are being rehabilitated.
