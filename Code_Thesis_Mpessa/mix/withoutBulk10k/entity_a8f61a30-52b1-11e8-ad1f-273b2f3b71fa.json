Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 23 September 2008. It was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, and March was the first month of the year. About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC, giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of Augustus. According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome.Supplicia canum was held on August 3, Lychnapsia on August 12, Nemoralia was held from August 13–15 (or on the full moon of August), Tiberinalia and Portumnalia on August 17, Consuales Ludi on August 18, Vinalia rustica on August 19, Vulcanalia on August 23, Opiconsivia on August 25, and Volturnalia on August 27. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nCertain meteor showers take place in August. The Kappa Cygnids take place in August, with the dates varying each year. The Alpha Capricornids meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the  Southern Delta Aquariids take place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28–29. The Perseids, a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. The star cluster of Messier 30 is best observed around August.\n\nAmong the aborigines of the Canary Islands, especially among the Guanches of Tenerife, the month of August received in the name of Beñesmer or Beñesmen, which was also the harvest festival held this month.\n\nAugust symbols\n\n*August's birthstones are the peridot, sardonyx, and spinel.  \n*Its birth flower is the gladiolus or poppy, meaning beauty, strength of character, love, marriage and family.[https://archive.is/20120911093344/http://www.shgresources.com/gems/birthflowers/ Birth months, flowers, and gemstones], shgresources.com\n*The Western zodiac signs for the month of August are Leo (until August 22) and Virgo (from August 23 onwards).\n\nObservances\n\nThis list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.\n\nNon-Gregorian observances: 2018 dates\n\n(Please note that all Baha'i, Islamic, and Jewish observances begin at the sundown prior to the date listed, and end at sundown of the date in question unless otherwise noted.)\n*August 25: Poya (Buddhism, public holiday in Sri Lanka)\n\nMonth-long observances\n\n* American Adventures Month (celebrating vacationing in the Americas)\n* Children's Eye Health and Safety Month\n* Digestive Tract Paralysis (DTP) Month\n* Get Ready for Kindergarten Month\n* Happiness Happens Month\n* Month of Philippine Languages (Philippines)\n* Neurosurgery Outreach Month\n* Psoriasis Awareness Month \n* Spinal Muscular Atrophy Awareness Month\n* What Will Be Your Legacy Month\n\nUnited States month-long observances\n\n* National Black Business Month \n* National Children's Vision and Learning Month \n* National Immunization Awareness Month \n* National Water Quality Month \n* National Win with Civility Month\n\nFood Months in the United States\n\n* National Catfish Month\n* National Dippin' Dots Month\n* Family Meals Month\n* Get Acquainted with Kiwifruit Month\n* National Goat Cheese Month.Bober, Mike.
