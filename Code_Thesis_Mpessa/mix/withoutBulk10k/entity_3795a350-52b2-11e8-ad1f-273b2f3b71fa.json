  "textBody" : "Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. Marble may be foliated. In geology the term \"marble\" refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.Kearey, Philip (2001). Dictionary of Geology, Penguin Group, London and New York, p. 163.  Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word \"marble\" derives from the Ancient Greek ,[http://www.pberseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Frmaron μάρμαρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library from , \"crystalline rock, shining stone\",[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Frmaros μάρμαρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/marble?viewuk Marble, Compact Oxford English Dictionary].

S. P. Beekes has suggested that a \"Pre-Greek origin is probable.\"R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 907.\n\nThis stem is also the basis for the English word marmoreal, meaning \"marble-like.\" While the English term resembles the French ', most other European languages follow the original Greek.\n\nPhysical origins\n\nMarble is a rock resulting from metamorphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks, most commonly limestone or dolomite rock. Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate crystals. Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock (protolith) have typically been modified or destroyed.\n\nPure white marble is the result of metamorphism of a very pure (silicate-poor) limestone or dolomite protolith. The characteristic swirls and veins of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as clay, silt, sand, iron oxides, or chert which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone. Green coloration is often due to serpentine resulting from originally magnesium-rich limestone or dolostone with silica impurities. These various impurities have been mobilized and recrystallized by the intense pressure and heat of the metamorphism.\n\nTypes\n\nExamples of historically notable marble varieties and locations:\n\nUses\n\nSculpture\n\nWhite marble has been prized for its use in sculptures since classical times. This preference has to do with its softness, which made it easier to carve, relative isotropy and homogeneity, and a relative resistance to shattering. Also, the low index of refraction of calcite allows light to penetrate several millimeters into the stone before being scattered out, resulting in the characteristic waxy look which gives \"life\" to marble sculptures of any kind, which is why many sculptors preferred and still prefer marble for sculpting.\n\nConstruction marble\n\nConstruction marble is a stone which is composed of calcite, dolomite or serpentine which is capable of taking a polish.Marble Institute of America pp. 223 Glossary More generally in construction, specifically the dimension stone trade, the term \"marble\" is used for any crystalline calcitic rock (and some non-calcitic rocks) useful as building stone. For example, Tennessee marble is really a dense granular fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon Ordovician limestone, that geologists call the Holston Formation.\n\nAshgabat, the capital city of Turkmenistan, was recorded in the 2013 Guinness Book of Records as having the world's highest concentration of white marble buildings.\n\nProduction\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, U.S. domestic marble production in 2006 was 46,400 tons valued at about $18.1 million, compared to 72,300 tons valued at $18.9 million in 2005. Crushed marble production (for aggregate and industrial uses) in 2006 was 11.8 million tons valued at $116 million, of which 6.5 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate. For comparison, 2005 crushed marble production was 7.76 million tons valued at $58.7 million, of which 4.8 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate. U.S. dimension marble demand is about 1.3 million tons. The DSAN World Demand for (finished) Marble Index has shown a growth of 12% annually for the 2000–2006 period, compared to 10.5% annually for the 2000–2005 period. The largest dimension marble application is tile.\n\nIn 1998, marble production was dominated by 4 countries that accounted for almost half of world production of marble and decorative stone. Italy and China were the world leaders, each representing 16% of world production, while Spain and India produced 9% and 8%, respectively. Italy is the world leader in marble export, with 20% share in global marble production, followed by China with 16%, India with 10%, Spain with 6%, and Portugal with 5%.[http://www.tunisianindustry.nat.tn/en/download/CEPI/IMCCV02.pdf Strategic positioning study of the marble branch]. CEPI Brief N° 6. tunisianindustry.nat.tn\n\nOccupational safety\n\nDust produced by cutting marble could cause lung disease but more research needs to be carried out on whether dust filters and other safety products reduce this risk.Foja, A.F.

Philippines University Thesis. fao.org\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for marble exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.\n\nMicrobial degradation\n\nThe haloalkaliphilic methylotrophic bacterium Methylophaga murata was isolated from deteriorating marble in the Kremlin. Bacterial and fungal degradation was detected in four samples of marble from Milan cathedral; black Cladosporium attacked dried acrylic resin using melanin.\n\nCultural associations\n\nAs the favorite medium for Greek and Roman sculptors and architects (see classical sculpture), marble has become a cultural symbol of tradition and refined taste. Its extremely varied and colorful patterns make it a favorite decorative material, and it is often imitated in background patterns for computer displays, etc.\n\nPlaces named after the stone include Marblehead, Massachusetts; Marblehead, Ohio; Marble Arch, London; the Sea of Marmara; India's Marble Rocks; and the towns of Marble, Minnesota; Marble, Colorado; Marble Falls, Texas, and Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York.

They were brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.\n\nArtificial marble\n\nMarble dust is combined with cement or synthetic resins to make reconstituted or cultured marble.
