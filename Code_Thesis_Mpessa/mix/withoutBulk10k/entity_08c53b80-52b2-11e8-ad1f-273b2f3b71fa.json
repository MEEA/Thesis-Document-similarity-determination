The proportion of the population aged below 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were aged between 15 and 65 years of age, and 4.3% were aged 65 years or older.\n\nAs of 2014, 60% of Hondurans live below the poverty line. More than 30% of the population is divided between the lower middle and upper middle class, less than 10% are wealthy or belong to the higher social class (most live in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula).\n\nStructure of the population \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2007) (estimates) (data refer to projections based on the 2001 Population Census):\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2010) (estimates):\n\nVital statistics\n\nRegistration of vital events is in Honduras not complete.

Amerindians are 6% of the population and AfroHondurans comprise 3%. As in other Latin American countries, the question of racial breakdown of a national population is contentious. Since the beginning of the 20th century at least, Honduras has publicly framed itself as a mestizo nation, ignoring and at times disparaging both the African component of the population and often also the surviving indigenous population that was still regarded as pure blood.Dario Euraque, \"The Threat of Blackness to the Mestizo Nation: Race and Ethnicity in the Honduran Banana Economy, 1920s and 1930s,\" in Steve Striffler and Mark Moberg, eds.
