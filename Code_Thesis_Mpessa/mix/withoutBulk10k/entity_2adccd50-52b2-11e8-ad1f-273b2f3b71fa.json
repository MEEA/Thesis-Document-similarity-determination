  "textBody" : "KornShell (ksh) is a Unix shell which was developed by David Korn at Bell Labs in the early 1980s and announced at USENIX on July 14, 1983.  The initial development was based on Bourne shell source code.\n  Other early contributors were Bell Labs developers Mike Veach and Pat Sullivan, who wrote the Emacs and vi-style line editing modes' code, respectively. KornShell is backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell, inspired by the requests of Bell Labs users.\n\nDesign \n\nKornShell complies with POSIX.2, Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992.)  Major differences between KornShell and the traditional Bourne shell include:\n* Job control, command aliasing, and command history designed after the corresponding C shell features. Job control was added to the Bourne Shell in 1989.http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/#variants Bourne Shell evolvement\n* A choice of three command line editing styles based on vi, Emacs, and XEmacs.\n* Associative arrays and built-in floating point arithmetic operations (only available in the  version of KornShell).\n* Dynamic extensibility of built-in commands (as of ).\n\nHistory \n\nKornShell was originally proprietary software.
