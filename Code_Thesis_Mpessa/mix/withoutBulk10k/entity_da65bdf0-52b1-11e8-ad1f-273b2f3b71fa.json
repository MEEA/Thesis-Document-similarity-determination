Thus the length of the circumference C is related to the radius r and diameter d by:\nC 2\\pi r \n \\pi d.\\,\n\nArea enclosed\n\nAs proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to  multiplied by the radius squared:\n\\mathrm{Area} = \\pi r^2.\\,\n\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by d,\n\\mathrm{Area} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\approx 0{.}7854d^2,\n\nthat is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d).\n\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nEquations\n\nCartesian coordinates\n\nIn an x–y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that\n\\left(x - a \\right)^2 + \\left( y - b \\right)^2=r^2.\n\nThis equation, known as the Equation of the Circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |x − a| and |y − b|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ \n\nThe equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as\nx = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,\ny = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,\nwhere t is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (a, b) to (x, y) makes with the positive x-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\nx = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,\ny = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,\n\nIn this parametrisation, the ratio of t to r can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the  line passing through the centre parallel to the x-axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parametrisation works only if t is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.\n\nIn homogeneous coordinates each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form\nx^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.\n\nPolar coordinates\n\nIn polar coordinates the equation of a circle is:\nr^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,\n\nwhere a is the radius of the circle, (r, \\theta) is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and (r_0, \\phi) is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., r0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and φ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred at the origin, i.e. r0 = 0, this reduces to simply . When , or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\nr = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for r, giving\nr = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},\nNote that without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\nComplex plane\n\nIn the complex plane, a circle with a centre at c and radius r has the equation:\n\n |z-c| = r\\,. \n\nIn parametric form this can be written:\n\n z = re^{it}+c.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q \n\nfor real p, q and complex g is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with p 1,\\ g\n-\\overline{c},\\ qr^2-|c|^2, since |z-c|^2 \n z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.\n\nTangent lines\n\nThe tangent line through a point P on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through P. If  and the circle has centre (a, b) and radius r, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (a, b) to (x1, y1), so it has the form . Evaluating at (x1, y1) determines the value of c and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,\nor\n(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ \n\nIf  then the slope of this line is\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.\n\nThis can also be found using implicit differentiation.\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\nx_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ \nand its slope is\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.\n\nProperties\n\n*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See Isoperimetric inequality.)\n*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,R). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.\n*All circles are similar.\n**A circle's circumference and radius are proportional.\n**The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.\n**The constants of proportionality are 2 and , respectively.\n*The circle which is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.\n**Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.\n*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.\n\nChord\n\n*Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n*The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n**A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n**The line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.\n*If a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplementary.\n**For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n*An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see Thales' theorem).\n*The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n*If the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then .\n*If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then  equals the square of the diameter.Posamentier and Salkind, Challenging Problems in Geometry, Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104–105, #4–23.\n*The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8r 2 – 4p 2 (where r is the circle's radius and p is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).College Mathematics Journal 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.\n*The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.Johnson, Roger A., Advanced Euclidean Geometry, Dover Publ., 2007.\n\nTangent\n\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n*Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n*If a tangent at A and a tangent at B intersect at the exterior point P, then denoting the centre as O, the angles ∠BOA and ∠BPA are supplementary.\n*If AD is tangent to the circle at A and if AQ is a chord of the circle, then .\n\nTheorems\n\n*The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EB, intersect at A, then .\n*If two secants, AE and AD, also cut the circle at B and C respectively, then . (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n*A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident.  If a tangent from an external point A meets the circle at F and a secant from the external point A meets the circle at C and D respectively, then . (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n*The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then , where ℓ is the length of the chord and r is the radius of the circle.\n*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). I.e.  where O is the centre of the circle.  This is the secant-secant theorem.\n\nInscribed angles\n\nAn inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\nSagitta\n\n*The sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n*Given the length y of a chord, and the length x of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:\n: r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.\n\nAnother proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows. Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (. Solving for r, we find the required result.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions \n\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\nConstruct a circle with a given diameter \n\n* Construct the midpoint  of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre  passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\nConstruct a circle through 3 noncollinear points \n\n* Name the points ,  and ,  \n* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .\n* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .\n* Label the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors . (They meet because the points are not collinear).\n* Construct the circle with centre  passing through one of the points ,  or  (it will also pass through the other two points).\n\nCircle of Apollonius\n\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, A and B.Ogilvy, C. Stanley, Excursions in Geometry, Dover, 1969, 14–17. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci A and B and a ratio of distances, any point P satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let C be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment AB. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment PC will bisect the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:\n\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.\n\nAnalogously, a line segment PD through some point D on AB extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.\n\nSecond, seeAltshiller-Court, Nathan, College Geometry, Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952). for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\nCross-ratios\n\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If A, B, and C are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points P for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ \n\nStated another way, P is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [A,B;C,P] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\nGeneralised circles\n\nIf C is the midpoint of the segment AB, then the collection of points P satisfying the Apollonius condition\n\\frac = \\frac\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\nCircles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures\n\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle – from Wolfram MathWorld] .

A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\n\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\nCircle as limiting case of other figures\n\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\n*A Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n*A superellipse has an equation of the form \\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1 for positive a, b, and n. A supercircle has .

When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n*A curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\nSquaring the circle\n\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.",

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ \n\nThe equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as\nx = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,\ny = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,\nwhere t is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (a, b) to (x, y) makes with the positive x-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\nx = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,\ny = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,\n\nIn this parametrisation, the ratio of t to r can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the  line passing through the centre parallel to the x-axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parametrisation works only if t is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.\n\nIn homogeneous coordinates each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form\nx^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.\n\nPolar coordinates\n\nIn polar coordinates the equation of a circle is:\nr^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,\n\nwhere a is the radius of the circle, (r, \\theta) is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and (r_0, \\phi) is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., r0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and φ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred at the origin, i.e. r0 = 0, this reduces to simply . When , or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\nr = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for r, giving\nr = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},\nNote that without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\nComplex plane\n\nIn the complex plane, a circle with a centre at c and radius r has the equation:\n\n |z-c| = r\\,. \n\nIn parametric form this can be written:\n\n z = re^{it}+c.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q \n\nfor real p, q and complex g is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with p 1,\\ g\n-\\overline{c},\\ qr^2-|c|^2, since |z-c|^2 \n z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.\n\nTangent lines\n\nThe tangent line through a point P on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through P. If  and the circle has centre (a, b) and radius r, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (a, b) to (x1, y1), so it has the form . Evaluating at (x1, y1) determines the value of c and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,\nor\n(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ \n\nIf  then the slope of this line is\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.\n\nThis can also be found using implicit differentiation.\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\nx_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ \nand its slope is\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.\n\nProperties\n\n*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See Isoperimetric inequality.)\n*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,R). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.\n*All circles are similar.\n**A circle's circumference and radius are proportional.\n**The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.\n**The constants of proportionality are 2 and , respectively.\n*The circle which is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.\n**Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.\n*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.\n\nChord\n\n*Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n*The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n**A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n**The line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.\n*If a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplementary.\n**For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n*An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see Thales' theorem).\n*The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n*If the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then .\n*If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then  equals the square of the diameter.Posamentier and Salkind, Challenging Problems in Geometry, Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104–105, #4–23.\n*The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8r 2 – 4p 2 (where r is the circle's radius and p is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).College Mathematics Journal 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.\n*The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.Johnson, Roger A., Advanced Euclidean Geometry, Dover Publ., 2007.\n\nTangent\n\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n*Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n*If a tangent at A and a tangent at B intersect at the exterior point P, then denoting the centre as O, the angles ∠BOA and ∠BPA are supplementary.\n*If AD is tangent to the circle at A and if AQ is a chord of the circle, then .\n\nTheorems\n\n*The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EB, intersect at A, then .\n*If two secants, AE and AD, also cut the circle at B and C respectively, then . (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n*A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident.  If a tangent from an external point A meets the circle at F and a secant from the external point A meets the circle at C and D respectively, then . (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n*The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then , where ℓ is the length of the chord and r is the radius of the circle.\n*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). I.e.  where O is the centre of the circle.  This is the secant-secant theorem.\n\nInscribed angles\n\nAn inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\nSagitta\n\n*The sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n*Given the length y of a chord, and the length x of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:\n: r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.\n\nAnother proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows. Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (. Solving for r, we find the required result.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions \n\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\nConstruct a circle with a given diameter \n\n* Construct the midpoint  of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre  passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\nConstruct a circle through 3 noncollinear points \n\n* Name the points ,  and ,  \n* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .\n* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .\n* Label the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors . (They meet because the points are not collinear).\n* Construct the circle with centre  passing through one of the points ,  or  (it will also pass through the other two points).\n\nCircle of Apollonius\n\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, A and B.Ogilvy, C. Stanley, Excursions in Geometry, Dover, 1969, 14–17. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci A and B and a ratio of distances, any point P satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let C be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment AB. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment PC will bisect the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:\n\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.\n\nAnalogously, a line segment PD through some point D on AB extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.\n\nSecond, seeAltshiller-Court, Nathan, College Geometry, Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952). for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\nCross-ratios\n\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If A, B, and C are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points P for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ \n\nStated another way, P is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [A,B;C,P] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\nGeneralised circles\n\nIf C is the midpoint of the segment AB, then the collection of points P satisfying the Apollonius condition\n\\frac = \\frac\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\nCircles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures\n\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle – from Wolfram MathWorld] . Mathworld.wolfram.com (2012-04-26). Retrieved on 2012-05-03.\n\nAbout every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circumcircle.html Circumcircle – from Wolfram MathWorld] . Mathworld.wolfram.com (2012-04-26). Retrieved on 2012-05-03.\n\nA tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon.[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentialPolygon.html Tangential Polygon – from Wolfram MathWorld] . Mathworld.wolfram.com (2012-04-26). Retrieved on 2012-05-03. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\n\nA cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\n\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\nCircle as limiting case of other figures\n\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\n*A Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n*A superellipse has an equation of the form \\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1 for positive a, b, and n. A supercircle has . A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which .\n*A Cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n*A curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\nSquaring the circle\n\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.
