  "textBody" : "The KAB-500Krhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/kab-500.htm is an electro-optical TV-guided fire and forget bomb developed by the Soviet Air Force in the 1980s.  It remains in service with the CIS and various export customers.\n\nThe KAB-500Kr is analogous to the American GBU-15 weapon.  It uses a standard Soviet/Russian FAB-500 general-purpose bomb, with a nominal weight of 500 kg (1,102 lb), as a warhead, adding a low-light television seeker and guidance fins to turn it into a guided, unpowered glide bomb.\n\nThe bomb is 3.05 m (10 ft) long and weighs 520 kg (1,150 lb), of which 380 kg (837 lb) is a hardened, armor-piercing warhead capable of penetrating up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) of reinforced concrete.  The weapon's seeker can lock onto a target at ranges of up to 15 to 17 km (9.4 to 10.6 miles), depending on visibility. The KAB-500-OD variant is equipped with a fuel-air explosive warhead. The technology of KAB-500Kr is also used for larger bombs, such as KAB-1500Kr based on the 1500 kg class FAB-1500 iron bomb.",
