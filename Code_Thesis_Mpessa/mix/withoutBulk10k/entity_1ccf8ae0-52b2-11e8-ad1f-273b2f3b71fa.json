Furthermore the name is related to talbis meaning confusion.Nicholson Studies In Islamic Mystic Routledge 2013 (first published 1998)  page 120 Another possibility is that it is derived from Ancient Greek  (), also the ultimate source of English 'devil'. However, there is no consensus on the root of the term.\n\nTheology\n\nAlthough Iblis resembles the Christian notion of Satan, Iblis is not regarded as the adversary of God; due to the strict monotheism of Islam, a duel between God and another entity is unthinkable.N. Ahmadi Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual Springer 1998  page 80Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009  page 46 The enmity of Iblis applies just to God's creation. Iblis owns only the power God granted him, after his request for permission to tempt humans astray from God's path. He is not the cause of evil, but takes advantage of humans' inclination to be self-centered.Charles Mathewes Understanding Religious Ethics John Wiley & Sons 2010  page 248\n\nQuran\n\nIblis is mentioned eleven times in the Quran by name, nine times related to his rebellion against God's command to prostrate. More often occurs the term Shaitan, that is, sometimes related to Iblis. Then God created Adam, He ordered all the angels to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued, that himself, created from fire, is superior to human, made from mud, accordingly should not prostrate. For his haughtiness, he was banished from heaven and condemned to hell. Therefore Iblis made a request, for trying to mislead Adam and his descendants. God grants his request but also warns, that he will have no power over Gods servants.\n\nSufism\n\nSufism rejects any concept of dualism and instead believe in the unity of existence. Therefore some mystics hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was fully devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. Accordingly he is regarded together with Muhammad as the two most perfect monotheists. But while Muhammad is the instrument of God's mercy, Iblis is the instrument of God's anger. Furthermore Iblis is depicted as an example of a true lover of God, teacher of oneness despite physical separation and rather a tragically fallen angelIslam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009  page 44 than a failed creature, since he preferred to go to hell, than to prostrate himself before someone else, than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God). Thus Iblis became an example for unrequited love.\n\nHowever not all Sufis are in agreement with a positive depiction of Iblis. Rumi's viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the great sins haughtiness and envy. He states: \"(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.\"Annemarie Schimmel The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi Annemarie Schimmel SUNY Press 1993  page 255 Iblis represents the principle of  \"one-eyed\" intellect; he only saw the outward earthly form of Adam, but was blind to the Divine spark hidden in him, using an illicit method of comparison.Walī Allāh al-Dihlawī Shāh Walī Allāh of Delhi's Hujjat Allāh Al-bāligha BRILL 1996  page 350 Hasan of Basra holds that Iblis was the first who used \"analogy\", comparing himself to someone else, this causing his sin. Iblis therefore also represents humans psyche moving towards sin or shows how love can cause envy and anxiety losing a beloved one.Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, Rumi Collected Poetical Works of Rumi (Delphi Classics) Delphi Classics 2015 story XI\n\nDepictions of Iblis\n\nIllustrations of Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any Satanic figure or heretic, and black body, symbolizing his corrupted nature. Another common depiction shows Iblis wearing special headcovering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban. In one painting, however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic headcovering.Na'ama Brosh, Rachel Milstein, Muzeʼon Yiśraʼel (Jerusalem) Biblical stories in Islamic painting Israel Museum 1991 page 27 The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis's fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven.Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Thaʻlabī, William M. Brinner ʻArāʻis al-majālis fī qiṣaṣ al-anbiyā, or: Lives of the prophets, Band 24 2002  page 69\n\nOral folklore narrations often describe Iblis as able to shape-shift but remaining one-eyed. Ammar ibn Yasir related a story about a black man, who was, how Muhammad later told him, actually Iblis. Before Iblis fell from heaven, according to Ibn Abbas, he had four wings, representing one of the most high ranks among the angels according to Islamic thought.\n\nAffiliation\n\nA question arises from the fact, Iblis, a creature made by God, started arguing with his creator, instead of obeying Him. An attempt to solve this question was the explanation on free-will, thus Iblis was not an angel but another creature, preferably a jinn and therefore distinguished by them. To support this arguement, Iblis is cited, then he boasts himself to be created from fire, an element from which the jinn were created too. However this argument loses its meaning, by the fact, other angels at least doubted Gods command as well, but Iblis was the only angel whose doubts prevailed.Murat Sofuoglu  The Manifest Destiny of Human Being University Press of America 2004  page 6Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009  page 46 Another arguement hold, Iblis as an angel, was subject to predeterminism. Accordingly it was forbidden for the angels to prostrate themselves before someone else than their creator. But then God gave this contradictional order, knowing only Iblis would refuse the latter instruction, thus appointing him as Satan, therefore creating the illusion of dualism.Ludo Abicht Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities Leuven University Press 2008  page 128 In this scenario, Iblis did not leave the path of God, but takes the role of a tempter in Gods plan. However due to his haughtiness, despiting another creation from God, he was banished from heaven.\n\nTextual arguements seems to make clear, in Surah , which states \"... they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn ...\", that Iblis was not an angel. However in Ancient Arabic the term \"jinn\", was related to any creature, invisible to human eye, including angels.Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009  page 34-37https://islaambooks.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-commentary-on-the-quran-volume-i-tafsir-al-tabari.pdf page 139 Additionally, the term \"jinn\", in this verse, is also linguistical related to Jannah (heaven), instead of a generic designation, referring to all those, who came from heaven.https://islaambooks.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-commentary-on-the-quran-volume-i-tafsir-al-tabari.pdf page 139Roger Allen Studying Modern Arabic Literature Edinburgh University Press 2015  Notes Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes Dictionary of Islam Asian Educational Services 1995  page 135\nThose who advocate an angelic origin of Iblis, point out, Iblis would not have been included into the command addressed to the angels, with Iblis as an exception, since the Quran states in Surah  \"So the angels prostrated—all of them entirely. Except Iblīs ...\".Joseph Hell Die Religion des Islam Motilal Banarsidass Publishe 1915 page 142 An arguement against it, can be found by Ibn Kathir, who asserts Opponent of an angelic origin of Iblis argues, although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and therefore was included in this command.Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition MSA Publication Limited 2013  page 136\n\nFurthermore, the composition of Iblis from fire is another subject for this dispute. The Quran does not distinguish the substances between different supernatural creatures, but according to a Hadith reported by ‘Ā’ishah the angels are created from light and Jann from blaze. Therefore scholars like Zayd ibn Ali and Hasan of Basra identified Al-Jann with Iblis and placed him analogue to Adam, the father of mankind, as the father of all jinn and demons.The Beginning and the End - Ibn Kathir - Volume I, also the Koranic commentary of the same author On the other hand, a tradition derived from Ibn Abbas, angels are generally created from light, but Iblis (or his clan) was an exception and indeed created from fire.Leo JungFallen Angels in Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan LiteratureWipf and Stock Publishers 2007  page 60 However scholars like Tabari, Al-Baydawi and Ibshihi assert, eventually fire and light both denote a subtle matter on different levels, thus it should not be taken too precise.M. Th. Houtsma E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Band 5 BRILL 1993  page 191 Accordingly Angels, Jinn and Demons, derived from fire, but all of them from different parts of the flame, and the angels from its light.\n\nAnother argument point out that Iblis has progeny but angels do not procreate. However it remains unclear, weather his progeny is a generic new species or just those who followed him. Additionally he first started to procreate after losing his angelic form anyway.

Thus arguements concerning Iblis decendants, to determine his essence, are unfounded.\n\nThe following four interpretations are commonly accepted in Islamic traditionsPatrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes Dictionary of Islam Asian Educational Services 1995  page 135:\n\n* Before the creation of Adam, there was a tribe of angels, created from fire and called 'Jinn', able to sin,  and Iblis belongs to this tribe. After Iblis disobeyed, he and those from his tribe, who followed him, were cast out from heaven and became demons.Stephen J. Vicchio Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008  page 183\n\n* Iblis was the first demon among the jinn, created from fire and the father of all the other demons.\n\n* Iblis was one of the earthly jinn, taken captive by the angels during battle. Later he grew up among the angels and became like one of them.\n\n* Due to his disobedience, Iblis turned from an angel into a jinn.\n\nIblis in Extra-Qur'anic narratives\n\nIblis as an Angel\n\nIblis was once an Archangel and God's dearest creature. He was the teacher of the other angels, and God gave him authority over the lower heavens. Then the jinn increasingly caused corruption on earth, God sent him with an army of angels to battle the jinn and they drove them into the mountains. Iblis felt superior to any other creature, especially since he was, unlike the other angels, created from fire. Then God created Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him, Iblis felt humiliated, and refused to accept the superiority of man, who was, according to Iblis, just another fallible entity, who would corrupt God's earth, like the jinn he just defeated before, while he would praise God's glory day and night.James William Hampson Stobart Islam & Its Founder Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge 1876 digitized 2006 original: Oxford University page 114 Therefore he was cast out of heaven, but his request, to attempt proving the unworthiness of mankind, was granted. Thus although Iblis's pride lost him his position in heaven, he remained part of God's plan. After the day of judgment, it is held that Iblis may return to heaven.Annemarie Schimmel Gabriel's Wing: A Study Into the Religious Ideas of Sir Muhammad Iqbal Brill Archive 1963 page 212\n\nNotable scholars, who clearly consider Iblis an Angel include: Ibn Abbas, Tabari,Brannon M.

One of these was Iblis, who grew up among the angels in heaven, and because of his piety was elevated to their rank.

Then Iblis invents a plan to trick the guardian. He approaches a peacock and tells him that all creatures will die and the peacock's beauty will perish.  But if he gets the fruit of eternity, every creature will last forever. Therefore the peacock contrives to slip Iblis's serpent into the Garden, by carrying him in his mouth. In the Garden, Iblis speaks through the serpent to Adam and Eve, and tricks them into eating from the forbidden tree.  Modern Muslims accuse the Yazidis of devil worship for venerating the peacock. Birgül Açikyildiz The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion I.B.Tauris 2014  page 161\n\nMoses and Iblis on Sinai\n\nGhazali told a tale about Iblis meeting Moses one the slopes of Sinai. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order.  Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a devil. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary.Richard Gramlich Der eine Gott: Grundzüge der Mystik des islamischen Monotheismus Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 1998  page 44Joseph E. B.
