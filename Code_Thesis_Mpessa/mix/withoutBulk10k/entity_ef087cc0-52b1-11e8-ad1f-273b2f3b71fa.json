The first, \"The Fight for Freedom\", was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary Spain and the Fight for Freedom.\n\nThe second part, \"They Shalt Not Pass\", was based on a short film No Pasaran! done by the Artkino Film Company of the Soviet Union, where van Dongen was working at the time the film was made.
