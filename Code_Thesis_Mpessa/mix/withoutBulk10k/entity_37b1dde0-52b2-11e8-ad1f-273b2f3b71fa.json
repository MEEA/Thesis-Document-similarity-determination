  "textBody" : "Macau is a Special Administrative Region on the southern coast of China. It is located at the south of Guangdong Province, on the tip of the peninsula formed by the Zhujiang (Pearl River) estuary on the east and the Xijiang (West River) on the west. Macau is situated 60 km west of Hong Kong and 145 km southwest of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province. It situates immediately east and south of Zhuhai.\n\nThe region comprises the Macau Peninsula and the islands of Taipa and Coloane. Macau was once an island but gradually a connecting sandbar turned into a narrow isthmus. Land reclamation in the 17th century made Macau into a peninsula, and a barrier gate was built to mark the separation between the peninsula and the mainland. Pre-colonial records show that Macau totalled only  but began to increase as a result of Portuguese settlement. Land growth has accelerated since the last quarter of the 20th century, from  in 1972 to  in 1983 to  in 1994. Macau's size has gradually increased as result of continued land reclamation, especially on Taipa and Coloane. In 2014, the total land area was approximately .\n\nThere is a  long border between Macau and mainland China and a forty-kilometer-long coastline. The main border crossing between Macau and China is the Portas do Cerco (Barrier Gate) Frontier Checkpoint on the Macau side, and the Gongbei checkpoint on the Chinese side.\n\nLocation, size, border, and coastline\n\nGeographic coordinates: \n\nArea\n\n*Total: 115.3 km²\n*Land: 30.4 km²\n*Water: 85 km²\n\nLand boundaries\n\n*Total: 0.34 km\n*Border city: Zhuhai, Guangdong Province   0.34 km\n\nCoastline\n\n*Coastline: 50.63 km\n*Maritime claims: not specified\n\nTopography\n\nLocation: Eastern Asia, bordering the South China Sea and China\n\nTerrain: generally flat\nElevation extremes:\nlowest point: South China Sea 0 m\nhighest point: Coloane Alto 172 m\n\nList of highest hills in Macau SAR\n\nMacau has generally flat terrain resulting from extensive land reclamation, but numerous steep hills mark the original natural land mass. The modern high-rise skyline of Macau obscures much of the hilly landscape. The Macau skyline both defines and obscures its topography.\n\nThe Macau Peninsula is narrow in shape but varies in terrain.\n\nClimate\n\nAlthough Macau is located in the tropics, it has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa), because the Siberian pressure system in the winter pushes cool air further south than similar semipermanent permanent high pressure systems. Its average year-round temperature is . Summers are very hot and humid: the July average temperature is  and the highest daytime temperature could reach . However, the heat is generally less intense than many places in mainland China due to the coastal location. Winters are short and mild: the January average is  and the lowest temperature could drop to , but very rarely any lower. There is about  of rainfall annually, with drier winters.\n\nMacau is exposed to tropical storms originating from the southern Pacific Ocean during the summer. Major destruction occurred in September 1874, when a devastating typhoon hit Macau and high seas swept across the low-lying area of the peninsula. There are always a few tropical storm occurrences in Macau each year (typically between May to October), although they vary in strengths. When they occur, they usually bring strong winds, rainfall and lower temperatures.\n\nPrevailing winds and weather types change follow the monsoon pattern. It is warm and moist when the southeast and southwest winds coming from Pacific Ocean, and typhoons are relatively common during summertime; and is dry and slightly cold when the north winds coming from Siberia or the northern part of Mainland China.\n\nDuring the transition period from northeast monsoon to southwest monsoon (March and April), the weather is moist and foggy. It is Macau's spring season. Summer is from May to September, when the southeast and southwest monsoon prevailing. It is rather hot and rainy. The weather in autumn (the end of September and October) is sunny and warm, when the southwest monsoon withdrawing gradually and the northeast monsoon advancing south. It is generally regarded as the most comfortable season there. Winter is from November to February next year, when the northeast monsoon prevailing. It is mainly dry, with occasional cold fronts arriving.\n\nThere are moderate to high levels of humidity year-round, with an annual average of 79.3%. Annual sunshine totals are moderate, at more than 1800 hours.\n\nNatural resources\n\nNegligible. In the past, large amounts of granite were extracted from Macau's hills for use as building material.\n\nFresh water\n\nRelying on the water supply of Xijiang River, Macau is at present suffering its worst ever crisis of salinity in freshwater during dry season in 2006 which takes place in late winter and early spring time.  The salinity level of freshwater has recently aggrandised far above the standard set up by the World Health Organization or WHO.\nBy the end of 2007, Macau will be able to solve the problem of tap-water supply with relatively high level of salinity after the completion of the Ping Gang project. This project is aimed at shifting the intake of raw-water on the Xijiang River 20 km upstream in order to give a wide berth to the salt tide in the province of Guangdong.\n\nLand use and reclamation\n\nUntil early 20th century, the Macau peninsula was dotted with small farms on its northern area, beyond the walls protecting the city. Currently, in the Macau peninsula, no arable land, natural pastures or woodland exists and forests have been cleared and plant species have been subjected to profound changes.
