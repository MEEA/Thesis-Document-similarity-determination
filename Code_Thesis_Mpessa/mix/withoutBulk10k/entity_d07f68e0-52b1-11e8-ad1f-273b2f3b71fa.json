  "textBody" : "A biome is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in. They can be found over a range of continents. Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate.[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/index.php The World's Biomes], Retrieved August 19, 2008, from [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/index.php University of California Museum of Paleontology]  \"Biome\" is a broader term than \"habitat\"; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats.\n\nWhile a biome can cover large areas, a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale.  For example, the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that are present on a human body.\n\nA 'biota' is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period, from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales. The biotas of the Earth make up the biosphere.\n\nHistory of the concept\n\nThe term was suggested in 1916 by Clements, originally as a synonym for biotic community of Möbius (1877).Clements, F. E. 1917. The development and structure of biotic communities. J. Ecology 5:120–121. Abstract of a talk in 1916, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2255652?seq1#page_scan_tab_contents]. Later, it gained its current definition, based on earlier concepts of phytophysiognomy, formation and vegetation (used in opposition to flora), with the inclusion of the animal element and the exclusion of the taxonomic element of species composition.Coutinho, L. M. (2006). O conceito de bioma. Acta Bot. Bras. 20(1): 13-23, [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?scriptsci_arttext&pid\nS0102-33062006000100002].Martins, F. R. & Batalha, M. A. (2011).

In German literature, particularly in the Walter terminology, the term is used similarly as biotope (a concrete geographical unit), while the biome definition used in this article is used as an international, non-regional, terminology - irrespectively of the continent in which an area is present, it takes the same biome name - and corresponds to his \"zonobiome\", \"orobiome\" and \"pedobiome\" (biomes determinated by climate zone, altitude or soil).Walter, H. & Breckle, S-W. (2002). Walter's Vegetation of the Earth: The Ecological Systems of the Geo-Biosphere. New York: Springer-Verlag, p. 86, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nSdaCSwxK5bIC].\n\nIn Brazilian literature, the term \"biome\" is sometimes used as synonym of \"biogeographic province\", an area based on species composition (the term \"floristic province\" being used when plant species are considered), or also as synonym of the \"morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain\" of Ab'Sáber, a geographic space with subcontinental dimensions, with the predominance of similar geomorphologic and climatic characteristics, and of a certain vegetation form. Both includes many biomes in fact.Batalha, M.A. (2011). The Brazilian cerrado is not a biome.

Disponível em: .\n\nClassifications\n\nTo divide the world in a few ecological zones is a difficult attempt, notably because of the small-scale variations that exist everywhere on earth and because of the gradual changeover from one biome to the other. Their boundaries must therefore be drawn arbitrarily and their characterization made according to the average conditions that predominate in them.\n\nA 1978 study on North American grasslands found a positive logistic correlation between evapotranspiration in mm/yr and above-ground net primary production in g/m2/yr. The general results from the study were that precipitation and water use led to above-ground primary production, while solar irradiation and temperature lead to below-ground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit.Pomeroy, Lawrence R. and James J. Alberts, editors. Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1988.  These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge’s bioclassification scheme (see below), which were then later simplified by Whittaker. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.\n\nHoldridge (1947, 1964) life zones\n\nHoldridge classified climates based on the biological effects of temperature and rainfall on vegetation under the assumption that these two abiotic factors are the largest determinants of the types of vegetation found in a habitat. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called \"humidity provinces\", which are clearly visible in his diagram. While this scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge acknowledged that these were important.\n\nAllee (1949) biome-types\n\nThe principal biome-types by Allee (1949):Allee, W.C. (1949).

His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\n\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan–Mar 1962), pp. 1–239.\n\nKey definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme\n\n* Physiognomy: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.\n* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that are similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\n* Formation: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\n* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\n* Formation-type:a grouping of convergent formations.\n\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to plant communities only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems. New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975. \n\nWhittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types\n\nWhittaker, seeing the need for a simpler way to express the relationship of community structure to the environment, used what he called \"gradient analysis\" of ecocline patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.\n# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\n# Climatic moisture gradient\n# Temperature gradient by altitude\n# Temperature gradient by latitude\n\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n* The gradient runs from favorable to extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\n* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\n* Trends in diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\n* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\n* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\n\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient, and combined this with gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\nBiome-types\n\n# Tropical rainforest\n# Tropical seasonal rainforest\n#* deciduous\n#* semideciduous\n# Temperate giant rainforest\n# Montane rainforest\n# Temperate deciduous forest\n# Temperate evergreen forest\n#* needleleaf\n#* sclerophyll\n# Subarctic-subalpin needle-leaved forests (taiga)\n# Elfin woodland\n# Thorn forests and woodlands\n# Thorn scrub\n# Temperate woodland\n# Temperate shrublands\n#* deciduous\n#* heath\n#* sclerophyll\n#* subalpine-needleleaf\n#* subalpine-broadleaf\n# Savanna\n# Temperate grassland\n# Alpine grasslands\n# Tundra\n# Tropical desert\n# Warm-temperate desert\n# Cool temperate desert scrub\n# Arctic-alpine desert\n# Bog\n# Tropical fresh-water swamp forest\n# Temperate fresh-water swamp forest\n# Mangrove swamp\n# Salt marsh\n# WetlandWhittaker, R.

The system, also assessing precipitation and temperature, finds nine major biome types, with the important climate traits and vegetation types. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.Walter, H. 1976. Die ökologischen Systeme der Kontinente (Biogeosphäre).

He subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989.

Both includes many biomes in fact.Batalha, M.A. (2011). The Brazilian cerrado is not a biome.

Their boundaries must therefore be drawn arbitrarily and their characterization made according to the average conditions that predominate in them.\n\nA 1978 study on North American grasslands found a positive logistic correlation between evapotranspiration in mm/yr and above-ground net primary production in g/m2/yr. The general results from the study were that precipitation and water use led to above-ground primary production, while solar irradiation and temperature lead to below-ground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit.Pomeroy, Lawrence R. and James J. Alberts, editors. Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1988.  These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge’s bioclassification scheme (see below), which were then later simplified by Whittaker. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.\n\nHoldridge (1947, 1964) life zones\n\nHoldridge classified climates based on the biological effects of temperature and rainfall on vegetation under the assumption that these two abiotic factors are the largest determinants of the types of vegetation found in a habitat. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called \"humidity provinces\", which are clearly visible in his diagram. While this scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge acknowledged that these were important.\n\nAllee (1949) biome-types\n\nThe principal biome-types by Allee (1949):Allee, W.C. (1949).

His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\n\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan–Mar 1962), pp. 1–239.\n\nKey definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme\n\n* Physiognomy: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.\n* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that are similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\n* Formation: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\n* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\n* Formation-type:a grouping of convergent formations.\n\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to plant communities only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems. New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975. \n\nWhittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types\n\nWhittaker, seeing the need for a simpler way to express the relationship of community structure to the environment, used what he called \"gradient analysis\" of ecocline patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.\n# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\n# Climatic moisture gradient\n# Temperature gradient by altitude\n# Temperature gradient by latitude\n\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n* The gradient runs from favorable to extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\n* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\n* Trends in diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\n* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\n* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\n\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient, and combined this with gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\nBiome-types\n\n# Tropical rainforest\n# Tropical seasonal rainforest\n#* deciduous\n#* semideciduous\n# Temperate giant rainforest\n# Montane rainforest\n# Temperate deciduous forest\n# Temperate evergreen forest\n#* needleleaf\n#* sclerophyll\n# Subarctic-subalpin needle-leaved forests (taiga)\n# Elfin woodland\n# Thorn forests and woodlands\n# Thorn scrub\n# Temperate woodland\n# Temperate shrublands\n#* deciduous\n#* heath\n#* sclerophyll\n#* subalpine-needleleaf\n#* subalpine-broadleaf\n# Savanna\n# Temperate grassland\n# Alpine grasslands\n# Tundra\n# Tropical desert\n# Warm-temperate desert\n# Cool temperate desert scrub\n# Arctic-alpine desert\n# Bog\n# Tropical fresh-water swamp forest\n# Temperate fresh-water swamp forest\n# Mangrove swamp\n# Salt marsh\n# WetlandWhittaker, R.

The system, also assessing precipitation and temperature, finds nine major biome types, with the important climate traits and vegetation types. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.Walter, H. 1976. Die ökologischen Systeme der Kontinente (Biogeosphäre).

He subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system, based on climate, is divided into seven domains (polar, humid temperate, dry, humid, and humid tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).http://www.fs.fed.us/land/ecosysmgmt/index.html Bailey System, US Forest ServiceBailey, R.
