Dominated Honduran politics from 1933-1957.\n* Democratic Unification Party (Partido Unificación Democrática—UD or PUD), founded in 1992 at the end of the Cold war when formerly clandestine leftist political parties were permitted to function openly.

The early 1980s were a relatively peaceful period compared to other countries in Central America buffeted by left-wing guerrillas. The Honduran government provided bases for U.S. backed counter-revolutionary armies operating in Nicaragua.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1984, several forced disappearances were carried out by the military, as proved before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/C/4-ing.html] Velásquez Rodríguez Case, Judgment of July 29, 1988, Inter-Am Ct. H.R. (Ser. C) No. 4 (1988) and in the Report of the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras.[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/1994/07/01/facts-speak-themselves] The Preliminary Report on Disappearances of the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras, July 1, 1994. In 1984, armed-forces chief General Gustavo Alvarez was deposed amid anti-US demonstrations in the capital, Tegucigalpa; this marked a decrease in counter-revolutionary activity, and the government continued to assist the United States' anti-Sandinista activities in Nicaragua in return for economic aid.\n\nIn 1986, the Liberal Party's José Azcona del Hoyo was elected president. Allegations of human rights abuses, and summary executions by police—especially of street gangs—have diminished steadily in recent years up to the present (2009), while political violence has been a constant.\n\nRafael Callejas became president in 1990 and introduced neo-liberal economic reforms and austerity measures. He is credited with a major push to improve the country's transportation infrastructure. He implemented a policy of requiring cabinet member nominees to first pass appropriate examinations, unique among politicians anywhere.\n\nIn 1993, the Liberal Party's Carlos Reina was elected president, promising to reform the judicial system and limit the power of the armed forces. In April 1995 compulsory military service was abolished. The Liberal Party's Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé  was elected in 1997, also promising to restructure the armed forces; in 1999 the armed forces were brought under civilian control.\n\nIn 2001, Ricardo Maduro was elected president on a platform that promised to stop rampant inflation afflicting the nation, and to put a stop to the brutal trademark violence of street gangs. At the time, the abuse of child-protection laws by gangs recruiting minors, and aggressive recruitment of members under threat of violence, lent broad popular support for Maduro's enlistment of the armed forces for a greater role in fighting crime during this time, as the police were seen as overwhelmed.See a timeline of Honduran political history including events affecting same at [http://timelines.ws/countries/HONDURAS.HTML  \"timeline: Honduras\"]. \nSee another from a leftist perspective, here: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1225471.stm \"Timeline: Honduras\"], BBC news...\n\nGang violence\n\nA major political issues in Honduras since about 1990 has been the high level of violent crime associated with the maras (Spanish for gangs, predominantly of young people), and drug trafficking organizations involved in the transport of cocaine from South America to the United States. Although gangs existed in Tegucigalpa in the 1980s, the phenomenon exploded around 1990. The range of criminal activities that street gangs carry out is broad, from kidnapping and human trafficking to drug, auto and weapons smuggling, as well as domestic extortion.[http://scm.oas.org/pdfs/2010/cp23852-12.pdf.] A recent estimate by the. FBI and their counterparts in Central America put the number of gang members in Honduras at 36,000. [http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/democracy/gangs_cam.pdf.]\n\nGang membership is partly attributable to population movement between Honduras and the United States. During the 1980s, many Hondurans fled to the US to avoid civil war and strife, and emigration continued for economic reasons after that. Other than civil war, high rates of poverty and unemployment and lack of education make at-risk youth more vulnerable to gangs. In Honduras, close to 30% of the population is aged 15–24.Seelke 2010\n\nImmigrant children who formed or joined urban gangs in cities such as Los Angeles began to have an impact in Honduras around 1990 because gang members completing prison sentences were deported. Deportees brought the two main gangs in Honduras, MS-13 and the 18th Street gang.USAID, Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment, [http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/democracy/honduras_profile.pdf Annex 3: Honduras Profile], 2006; especially page 5. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration and Enforcement reported that Honduras received 2,345 total criminal deportations. However, it is unclear how many were gang-affiliated. \n\nAlmost a third of Hondurans feel a sense of insecurity related to crime. The report listed as causes and risk factors, \"Lack of opportunities and alternatives for youth and adolescents, family breakdown, movement of Hondurans to and from the United States, and abuse of drugs and alcohol, and presence of weapons\".\n\nHowever, the \"departamento\" with more weapons per person than anywhere else in the nation, Olancho, is the only area with no gang presence at all.\n\nThe report adds however, that the \"overwhelming attention given to gang violence by the media and the government\" is partly responsible. Gang members often compete to see which crime receives the most coverage. It has been recently contended though that the media tends to exaggerate the gang problem, thus making Hondurans believe their communities less secure than they really are,[http://www.ansarilawfirm.com/docs/CRS-Report-Gangs-in-Central-America-1-11-2007.pdf.], because of the extreme violence that accompanies the crimes perpetrated by these gangs. Another reason for the attention is that they most affect the lower-income population disproportionately, and almost all areas of public activities were affected.\n\nThe murder rate in 1999 was 154 murders per 100,000; around 2005 this had fallen to 49 per 100,000. (Tohe death rate from all causes is roughly 1000 per 100,000 population.)1000 per 100,000 population is a very rough estimate based on 1.2% annual population growth and a life expectancy of 70 years. Although street gangs do play a significant role in this high rate, organized crime, drug trafficking and social violence are other factors that contribute as well. The local police have been suspected in extrajudicial killings of street children as a form of social cleansing, to combat the growing gang numbers.  The USAID quote and murder rate are from USAID, Honduras Profile, op cit. Most of the crime in Honduras takes place in the big cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. A survey by Mitchell A. Seligson in 2004 found that 18% of the population thought public security and violence – delinquency, crime, violence, drug trafficking, and gangs – were the most serious problem facing the country.Seligson survey cited in USAID, Honduras Profile, op cit.\n\nHonduras has been not only a transit point for cocaine running between Colombia and the United States, a pattern broken substantially after the arrest and exile of the ex-president Mel Zelaya,  but also has an internal market, creating all sorts of inner-city problems. Gangs sell crack, commit other crimes, and hire themselves out to organised drug smugglers. Those engaged in international trafficking are better resourced than the state authorities combating them. Although gang members have been arrested for selling drugs at the street level, it is still unclear how much interaction they have with the larger drug cartels and their operations within Honduras.[http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Content/Documents/History-of-Street-Gangs.pdf.]\n\nSome would use this argument to justify increasing US military aid to Honduras to help fight the organised drug gangs, while others claim that Honduras would be better off legalizing drugs, thus avoiding military solutions to Honduran security problems. A recent form of U.S. aid that addresses the gang problem was the creation of the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), originally seen as a part of the U.S.- Mexico Mérida Initiative. In 2010 the U.S. Congress separated funding for Central America totaling $83 million. Although some of the aid came in the form of military hardware, some components focused on strengthening the receiving country's judicial system.[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41215.pdf]\n\nPresident Ricardo Maduro, a former chairman of the Central Bank of Honduras, ran on an anti-crime platform after his only son was murdered on 28 April 1999. During his tenure at the Central Bank of Honduras, a banking license was given to Banco de Producción. After leaving the Central Bank he became chairman and majority stockholder of Banco de Producción, and the general manager of the Central Bank, Ana Cristina Mejia de Pereira, became general manager of Banco de la Producción. \n\nMaduro came into power in January 2002 with a wave of measures against gangs and delinquency, the most noticeable, soldiers patrolling the streets. Many gang members were jailed for illicit association. His \"Mano Duro\" policy (name used to describe Central American leaders taking a hard stance against crime) led to the creation of a penal code in 2003 which made street gangs like MS-13 and M-18 illegal and established jail sentences up to 12 years for proven membership.[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34112.pdf.]\n\nViolent crime dipped noticeably under Maduro. These \"mano duro\" policies had significant downsides as well. For example, many youth are wrongly arrested for membership but later become recruited into gangs while in jail. Also, these gang round-ups  led to the overcrowding in the prison system. Regardless of the initial signs of success, gangs learned to adapt and continued to carry out their activities.Seelke 2009 Some reports say that gang leaders from El Salvador come into Honduras to help stop their decline.\n\nUnder President Zelaya's term, the government attempted to create dialog with gang members to sway them to renounce their violence and re-integrate into society. However, this program relied mainly on private groups to implement the actual re-entry programs. Zelaya also created a specialized anti-gang unit within the police force which he used to coordinate patrols with the Honduran military. Although these patrols led to the arrests of 1,200 gang members, the rate of violence in Honduras did not subside.Ribando 2007\n\nTheir desperation resulted in a \"declaration of war\" against the government, and three major events over the last few years brought this tiny country to the attention of the world media: a massacre of 68 prisoners at the prison farm just outside La Ceiba on 5 March 2003, a fire in the prison at San Pedro Sula that killed 107 prisoners on 18 May 2004, and the massacre of 27 innocent men, women and children in San Pedro Sula, on 23 December 2004.\n\nA massacre in the San Pedro Sula suburb of Chamelecón left 27 dead and 29 injured. The murderers left behind a message, claiming to come from the Cinchoneros,  railing against Maduro, Lobo, Álvarez and the death penalty. The Cinchoneros are believed to be defunct, however. The attackers promised another massacre before the new year. However one suspect was detained very shortly afterwards in another part of San Pedro Sula, and further arrests were later made. Local police said that the gunmen were members of the street gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), and the supposed mastermind of the attack, Ebner Anibal Rivera-Paz, was later arrested in Falfurrias,Texas.[http://foreignaffairs.com/articles/60803/ana-arena/how-the-street-gangs-took-central-america.]\n\nAfter Maduro left office gang resurgence was felt and their presence continued, although less than before, but now using the cover of anti-government demonstrations for their activities.\n\nElections\n\nThe PNH and PLH have ruled the country for decades. In the last years, Honduras has had five Liberal presidents: Roberto Suazo Córdova, José Azcona del Hoyo, Carlos Roberto Reina, Carlos Roberto Flores and Manuel Zelaya, and three Nationalists: Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero Porfirio Lobo Sosa and Ricardo Maduro.\nThe elections have been full of controversies, including questions about whether Azcona was born in Honduras or Spain, and whether Maduro should have been able to stand given he was born in Panama.\n\nOn February 20, 2005 the PNH and the PLH held internal party elections (primaries) to decide who would represent them in the forthcoming presidential elections in November. Porfirio Pepe Lobo became the PNH candidate. Manuel Zelaya became the Liberal Party candidate. Forty-five percent of the electorate voted in the primaries: 24% for the Liberals and 21% for the National Party. According to the Country Report quoted in the U.C. San Diego Library Latin American election results, \"The low participation rate in the primaries . . . is a reflection of the lack of public faith in Honduras's political institutions and leaders.\"[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html UCSD Latin america election results]\n\nA Presidential and general election was held on November 27, 2005. Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) won,  with Porfirio Pepe Lobo of the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) coming in second. Voter turnout was 55% of the 3.9 million eligible. The PNH challenged the election results, and Lobo Sosa did not concede until December 7.  Towards the end of December the government finally released the total ballot count, giving Zelaya the official victory.  Zelaya was inaugurated as Honduras' new president on January 27, 2006.\n\nZelaya presidency\n\nOn 20 December 2007, the National Congress, at the urging of the leaders of both of the dominant parties,  passed a set of electoral reforms.\nThe reforms were opposed by President Manuel Zelaya, who indicated that he would veto them, citing constitutional objections.\nThe reforms would move the date of the presidential primaries ahead from February 2009 to November 2008, change the location of vote-counting from a central one to the individual municipalities, and radically increase public funding of political parties, from about US$3.2 million every election cycle to about US$52 million every election cycle.Central America report (Guatemala), 18 January 2008, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries, [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html Latin American elections statistics], retrieved 2009.\n\nOuster of President Zelaya on June 28, 2009\n\nThe President Manuel Zelaya's affiliation in 2008 with the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ALBA spaked controversy. There was further controversy when he refused to submit the government budget for Congressional approval.\n\nIn April and May 2009 Zelaya announced plans for a non-binding  poll on whether to hold a referendum about whether to convene a constituent assembly that would rewrite the constitution.\n\nThe Honduran Supreme Court had upheld a lower court injunction against the 28 June poll, and on 26 June – while Zelaya ignored the injunction – it issued a secret order for his detention.\n\nOn June 28 Honduran soldiers entered the presidential palace and arrested Zelaya,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8123126.stm \"Honduran leader forced into exile\"], BBC, 28 June 2009; One hundred soldiers: [http://www.alternet.org/world/141026/honduran_leader's_populism_is_what_provoked_military_violence/?page=entire \"Honduran Leader's Populism is what Provoked Military Violence\"], Benjamin Dangl, Alternet, 1 July 2009.

They put him on a military airplane which flew him to Costa Rica.\n\nSubsequently on June 28, the Honduran Congress, in an extraordinary session, voted to remove Zelaya from office and appoint his constitutional successor, Speaker of Congress Roberto Micheletti, in his place as interim President  for a term that ends on 27 January 2010.\n\nInternational reaction was universally negative with widespread condemnation of the events as a coup d'état. Almost no foreign government had recognized Micheletti as president.\n\nPolitical pressure groups\n\nSome of the main political pressure groups are the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH); Confederation of Honduran Workers (CTH); Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations or CCOP; General Workers Confederation or CGT; Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP); National Association of Honduran Campesinos or ANACH; National Union of Campesinos or UNC; United Federation of Honduran Workers or FUTH\n\nGuerrilla groups\n\n*The Revolutionary Popular Forces Lorenzo Zelaya was in resistance to the government, and is now defunct.\n*The Cinchoneros were a leftist guerrilla group active in the 1980s, targeting foreign and corporate interests in the country, but are now defunct.\n\nInternational organization participation",

In 2010 the U.S. Congress separated funding for Central America totaling $83 million. Although some of the aid came in the form of military hardware, some components focused on strengthening the receiving country's judicial system.[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41215.pdf]\n\nPresident Ricardo Maduro, a former chairman of the Central Bank of Honduras, ran on an anti-crime platform after his only son was murdered on 28 April 1999. During his tenure at the Central Bank of Honduras, a banking license was given to Banco de Producción. After leaving the Central Bank he became chairman and majority stockholder of Banco de Producción, and the general manager of the Central Bank, Ana Cristina Mejia de Pereira, became general manager of Banco de la Producción. \n\nMaduro came into power in January 2002 with a wave of measures against gangs and delinquency, the most noticeable, soldiers patrolling the streets. Many gang members were jailed for illicit association. His \"Mano Duro\" policy (name used to describe Central American leaders taking a hard stance against crime) led to the creation of a penal code in 2003 which made street gangs like MS-13 and M-18 illegal and established jail sentences up to 12 years for proven membership.[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34112.pdf.]\n\nViolent crime dipped noticeably under Maduro. These \"mano duro\" policies had significant downsides as well. For example, many youth are wrongly arrested for membership but later become recruited into gangs while in jail. Also, these gang round-ups  led to the overcrowding in the prison system. Regardless of the initial signs of success, gangs learned to adapt and continued to carry out their activities.Seelke 2009 Some reports say that gang leaders from El Salvador come into Honduras to help stop their decline.\n\nUnder President Zelaya's term, the government attempted to create dialog with gang members to sway them to renounce their violence and re-integrate into society. However, this program relied mainly on private groups to implement the actual re-entry programs. Zelaya also created a specialized anti-gang unit within the police force which he used to coordinate patrols with the Honduran military. Although these patrols led to the arrests of 1,200 gang members, the rate of violence in Honduras did not subside.Ribando 2007\n\nTheir desperation resulted in a \"declaration of war\" against the government, and three major events over the last few years brought this tiny country to the attention of the world media: a massacre of 68 prisoners at the prison farm just outside La Ceiba on 5 March 2003, a fire in the prison at San Pedro Sula that killed 107 prisoners on 18 May 2004, and the massacre of 27 innocent men, women and children in San Pedro Sula, on 23 December 2004.\n\nA massacre in the San Pedro Sula suburb of Chamelecón left 27 dead and 29 injured. The murderers left behind a message, claiming to come from the Cinchoneros,  railing against Maduro, Lobo, Álvarez and the death penalty. The Cinchoneros are believed to be defunct, however. The attackers promised another massacre before the new year. However one suspect was detained very shortly afterwards in another part of San Pedro Sula, and further arrests were later made. Local police said that the gunmen were members of the street gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), and the supposed mastermind of the attack, Ebner Anibal Rivera-Paz, was later arrested in Falfurrias,Texas.[http://foreignaffairs.com/articles/60803/ana-arena/how-the-street-gangs-took-central-america.]\n\nAfter Maduro left office gang resurgence was felt and their presence continued, although less than before, but now using the cover of anti-government demonstrations for their activities.\n\nElections\n\nThe PNH and PLH have ruled the country for decades. In the last years, Honduras has had five Liberal presidents: Roberto Suazo Córdova, José Azcona del Hoyo, Carlos Roberto Reina, Carlos Roberto Flores and Manuel Zelaya, and three Nationalists: Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero Porfirio Lobo Sosa and Ricardo Maduro.\nThe elections have been full of controversies, including questions about whether Azcona was born in Honduras or Spain, and whether Maduro should have been able to stand given he was born in Panama.\n\nOn February 20, 2005 the PNH and the PLH held internal party elections (primaries) to decide who would represent them in the forthcoming presidential elections in November. Porfirio Pepe Lobo became the PNH candidate. Manuel Zelaya became the Liberal Party candidate. Forty-five percent of the electorate voted in the primaries: 24% for the Liberals and 21% for the National Party. According to the Country Report quoted in the U.C. San Diego Library Latin American election results, \"The low participation rate in the primaries . . . is a reflection of the lack of public faith in Honduras's political institutions and leaders.\"[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html UCSD Latin america election results]\n\nA Presidential and general election was held on November 27, 2005. Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) won,  with Porfirio Pepe Lobo of the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) coming in second. Voter turnout was 55% of the 3.9 million eligible. The PNH challenged the election results, and Lobo Sosa did not concede until December 7.  Towards the end of December the government finally released the total ballot count, giving Zelaya the official victory.  Zelaya was inaugurated as Honduras' new president on January 27, 2006.\n\nZelaya presidency\n\nOn 20 December 2007, the National Congress, at the urging of the leaders of both of the dominant parties,  passed a set of electoral reforms.\nThe reforms were opposed by President Manuel Zelaya, who indicated that he would veto them, citing constitutional objections.\nThe reforms would move the date of the presidential primaries ahead from February 2009 to November 2008, change the location of vote-counting from a central one to the individual municipalities, and radically increase public funding of political parties, from about US$3.2 million every election cycle to about US$52 million every election cycle.Central America report (Guatemala), 18 January 2008, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries, [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html Latin American elections statistics], retrieved 2009.\n\nOuster of President Zelaya on June 28, 2009\n\nThe President Manuel Zelaya's affiliation in 2008 with the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ALBA spaked controversy. There was further controversy when he refused to submit the government budget for Congressional approval.\n\nIn April and May 2009 Zelaya announced plans for a non-binding  poll on whether to hold a referendum about whether to convene a constituent assembly that would rewrite the constitution.\n\nThe Honduran Supreme Court had upheld a lower court injunction against the 28 June poll, and on 26 June – while Zelaya ignored the injunction – it issued a secret order for his detention.\n\nOn June 28 Honduran soldiers entered the presidential palace and arrested Zelaya,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8123126.stm \"Honduran leader forced into exile\"], BBC, 28 June 2009; One hundred soldiers: [http://www.alternet.org/world/141026/honduran_leader's_populism_is_what_provoked_military_violence/?page=entire \"Honduran Leader's Populism is what Provoked Military Violence\"], Benjamin Dangl, Alternet, 1 July 2009.

They put him on a military airplane which flew him to Costa Rica.\n\nSubsequently on June 28, the Honduran Congress, in an extraordinary session, voted to remove Zelaya from office and appoint his constitutional successor, Speaker of Congress Roberto Micheletti, in his place as interim President  for a term that ends on 27 January 2010.\n\nInternational reaction was universally negative with widespread condemnation of the events as a coup d'état. Almost no foreign government had recognized Micheletti as president.\n\nPolitical pressure groups\n\nSome of the main political pressure groups are the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH); Confederation of Honduran Workers (CTH); Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations or CCOP; General Workers Confederation or CGT; Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP); National Association of Honduran Campesinos or ANACH; National Union of Campesinos or UNC; United Federation of Honduran Workers or FUTH\n\nGuerrilla groups\n\n*The Revolutionary Popular Forces Lorenzo Zelaya was in resistance to the government, and is now defunct.\n*The Cinchoneros were a leftist guerrilla group active in the 1980s, targeting foreign and corporate interests in the country, but are now defunct.\n\nInternational organization participation.
