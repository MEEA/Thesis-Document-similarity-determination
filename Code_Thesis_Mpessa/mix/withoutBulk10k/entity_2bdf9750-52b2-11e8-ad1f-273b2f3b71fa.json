  "textBody" : "Kołobrzeg (; ) is a city in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in north-western Poland with about 47,000 inhabitants (). Kołobrzeg is located on the Parsęta River on the south coast of the Baltic Sea (in the middle of the section divided by the Oder and Vistula Rivers). It has been the capital of Kołobrzeg County in West Pomeranian Voivodship since 1999, and was in Koszalin Voivodship from 1950 to 1998.\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Slavic Pomeranians founded a settlement at the site of modern Budzistowo. Thietmar of Merseburg first mentioned the site as Salsa Cholbergiensis. Around the year 1000, when the city was part of Poland, it became seat of the Diocese of Kołobrzeg. During the High Middle Ages, the town was expanded with an additional settlement a few kilometers north of the stronghold and chartered with Lübeck law. The city later joined the Hanseatic League. Within the Duchy of Pomerania, the town was the urban center of the secular reign of the prince-bishops of Cammin and their residence throughout the High and Late Middle Ages. When it was part of Brandenburgian Pomerania during the Early Modern Age, it withstood Polish and Napoleon's troops in the Siege of Kolberg. From 1815, it was part of the Prussian province of Pomerania. As the Nazis took power in Germany, the local Jewish population was discriminated against, determined to be subhuman and eventually subjected to genocide. In 1945 Polish and Soviet troops seized the town, while the remaining German population which had not fled the advancing Red Army was expelled. Kołobrzeg, now part of post-war Poland and devastated in the preceding Battle of Kolberg, was rebuilt but lost its status as the regional center to the nearby city of Koszalin.\n\nEtymology\n\n\"Kołobrzeg\" literally means \"by the shore\" in Polish: \"koło\" translates as \"by\" and \"brzeg\" translates as \"coast\" or \"shore\".  has a similar etymology. The original name of Cholberg was taken by Polish and Kashubian linguists in the 19th and 20th centuries to reconstruct the name. After German settlement, the original name of Cholberg  evolved into .\n\nHistory \n\nSlavic Pomeranian stronghold at modern Budzistowo \n\nAccording to Piskorski (1999) and Kempke (2001), Slavic immigration reached Farther Pomerania in the 7th century. First Slavic settlements in the vicinity of Kołobrzeg were centered around nearby deposits of salt and date to 6th and 7th century.Tadeusz Gasztold, Hieronim Kroczyński, Hieronim Rybicki, Kołobrzeg: zarys dziejów, Wydaw.

By the turn from the 10th to the 11th century, the smaller burghs in the Parseta area were given up. With the area coming under control of the Polish Duke Mieszko I, only two strongholds remained and underwent an enlargement, the one at Budzistowo and a predecessor of later Białogard (Belgard). These developments were most likely associated with the establishment of Polish power over this part of the Baltic coast. In the 10th century the trade of salt and fish led to the development of the settlement into a town.[http://miasto.kolobrzeg.eu/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id58:epoki-historyczne&catid\n37:historia&Itemid=78] ‘Historical eras’ Official webpage of the city\n\nPiast Poland and conversion \n\nDuring  Polish rule of the area in the late 10th century, the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg (975-1018) mentions salsa Cholbergiensis as the see of the Bishopric of Kołobrzeg, set up during the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 and placed under the Archdiocese of Gniezno. The congress was organized by Polish king Bolesław Chrobry and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, and also led to the establishment of bishoprics in Kraków and Wrocław, connecting the territories of the Polish state.

The Polish - German war ended with Polish victory, which was confirmed by the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.\n\nDuring his campaigns in the early 12th century, Bolesław III Wrymouth reacquired Pomerania for Poland, and made the local \"Griffin\" dynasty his vassals. The stronghold was captured by the Polish army in the winter of 1107/08, when the inhabitants (cives et oppidani) including a duke (dux Pomeranorum) surrendered without resistance.Jörg Jarnut, Peter Johanek, Die Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt im 11.

This marked the first beginnings of German influence in the area. After Boleslaw's death, the Duchy of Pomerania regained independence,Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.386 before the dukes became vassals of Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire in the late 12th century.\n\nBesides St. Mary's, a St. John's church and a St. Petri's chapel were built.Jörg Jarnut, Peter Johanek, Die Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt im 11.

The settlers received several privileges such as exemption from certain taxes and several benefits, making it difficult for the Slavic population to compete with Germans, and as result Slavs impoverished.\n\nHenceforth, the nearby former stronghold was turned into a village and renamed \"Old Town\"  (, , ), first documented in 1277 and used until 1945 when it was renamed \"Budzistowo\". A new St. Mary's church was built within the new town before the 1260s,Jörg Jarnut, Peter Johanek, Die Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt im 11. Jahrhundert, Köln-Weimar-Wien 1998, pp.273-305, republished in Winfried Schich, Ralf Gebuhr, Peter Neumeister, Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft - Siedlung und Wirtschaft im Bereich der Germania Slavica, BWV Verlag, 2007, p.280,  while St. Mary's in the former Pomeranian stronghold was turned into a nuns' abbey. In 1277 St. Benedict's monastery for nuns was founded, which in the framework of the Pomeranian Reformation  in 1545 was then changed into an educational institution  for noble Protestant ladies.Franz Manthey: Polnische Kirchengeschichte. Hildesheim 1965, p. 31.\n\nAlready in 1248, the Kammin bishops and the Pomeranian dukes had interchanged the terrae Stargard and Kolberg, leaving the bishops in charge of the latter. When in 1276 they became the souvereign of the town also, they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from nearby Köslin (Koszalin).Gerhard Köbler, Historisches Lexikon der Deutschen Länder: die deutschen Territorien vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart, 7th edition, C.H.Beck, 2007, p.113,  In 1345, the bishops became Imperial immediate dukes in their secular reign.\n\nIn 1361, Kolberg joined the Hanseatic League.\n\nWhen the property of the Bishopric of Kammin was secularized during the Protestant Reformation in 1534, their secular reign including the Kolberg area became intermediately ruled by a Lutheran titular bishop, before it was turned into a Sekundogenitur of the House of Pomerania.\n\nIn the 15th century the city traded with Scotland, Amsterdam and Scandinavia. Beer, salt,  honey, wool and flour were exported, while merchants imported textiles from England, southern fruits, and cod liver oil. In the 16th century, the city reached 5,000 inhabitants. According to the city's website, the Slavs in the city were discriminated, and their rights in trade and crafts were limited, with bans on performing certain types of professions and taking certain positions in the city\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Kolberg was occupied by imperial forces from 1627 to 1630, and thereafter by Swedish forces.\n\nModern era: In Prussia\n\nKolberg, with most of Farther Pomerania, was granted to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia and, after the signing of the Treaty of Stettin (1653), was part of the Province of Pomerania.  It became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.  In 1761, during the Seven Years' War, the town was captured after three subsequent sieges by the Russian commander Peter Rumyantsev.  At the end of the war, however, Kolberg was returned to Prussia.\n\nDuring Napoleon's invasion of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition, the town was besieged from mid-March to July 2, 1807, by the Grande Armée and by Polish forces drawn from insurgents against Prussian rule (a street named for the commander leading Polish soldiers is located within the present-day city).  The city's defense, led by then Lieutenant-Colonel August von Gneisenau, held out until the war was ended by the Treaty of Tilsit.  Kolberg became part of the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1815, after the final defeat of Napoleon; until 1872, it was administered within the Fürstenthum District (\"Principality District\", recalling the area's former special status), then it was within Landkreis Kolberg-Körlin.\nMarcin Dunin, archbishop of Poznań and Gniezno and Roman Catholic primate of Poland, was imprisoned by Prussian authorities for ten months in 1839-1840 in the cityPapiestwo wobec sprawy polskiej w latach 1772-1865:\nwybór źródel Otton Beiersdorf Zaklad Narodowy im. Ossolinskich,1960 page 309  and after his release, he tried to organise a chaplaincy for the many Polish soldiers stationed in Kolberg.Na stolicy prymasowskiej w Gnieźnie i w Poznaniu:\nszkice o prymasach Polski w okresie niewoli narodowej i w II Rzeczypospolitej : praca zbiorowa Feliks Lenort Księgarnia Św.

A Nazi newspaper, the Kolberger Beobachter, listed Jewish shops and business that were to be boycotted.  Nazis also engaged in hate propaganda against Jewish lawyers, doctors, and craftsmen.\"Kołobrzeg – Historia\"Wirtualny Sztetl At the end of 1935, Jews were banned from working in the city's health spas. During Kristallnacht, the Jewish synagogue and homes were destroyed, and in 1938 the local Jewish cemetery was vandalised, while a cemetery shrine was turned to stable by German soldiers.[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/kolobrzeg/5,historia/?ver3 Kołobrzeg – Historia] Wirtualny Sztetl-Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich In 1938, all Jews in Kolberg, as all over Germany, were renamed in official German documents as \"Israel\" (for males) or \"Sarah\" (for females).  In the beginning of 1939, Jews were banned from attending German schools and the entire adult population had its driving licenses revoked.  After years of discrimination and harassment, local Jews were deported by the German authorities to concentration camps in 1940.\n\nSecond World War\n\nThe city website mentions that during the Second World War the German state brought in forced labour workers,  among them Poles. The city's economy  was changed to military production-especially after the German invasion of the  Soviet Union.[Epoki Historyczne http://miasto.kolobrzeg.eu/index.php?option\ncom_content&viewarticle&id\n58:epoki-historyczne&catid37:historia&Itemid\n78]\nThe forced labourers were threatened with everyday harassment and repression; they were forbidden from using phones, holding cultural events and sports events, they could not visit restaurants or swimming pools, or have contact with the local German population. Poles were only allowed to attend a church mass once a month - and only in the German language. They also had smaller food rations than Germans, and had to wear a sign with the letter P on their clothes indicating their ethnic background. Additionally, medical help for Polish workers was limited by the authorities. Arrests and imprisonment for various offences, such as \"slow pace of work\" or leaving the workspace, were everyday occurrences.Kołobrzeg: zarys dziejówb Tadeusz Gasztold, Hieronim Kroczyński, Hieronim Rybicki - 1979 - page 72\n\nIn 1944, the city was designated a \"stronghold\" (Festung) — Festung Kolberg. The 1807 siege was used for the last Nazi propaganda film, Kolberg shortly before the end of the war by Joseph Goebbels . It was meant to inspire the Germans with its depiction of the heroic Prussian defence during the Napoleonic Wars. Tremendous resources were devoted to filming this epic, even diverting tens of thousands of troops from the front lines to have them serve as extras in battle scenes. Ironically, the film was released in the final few weeks of Nazi Germany's existence, when most of the country's cinemas were already destroyed.\n\nOn 10 February 1945, the German torpedo-boat T-196 brought about 300 survivors of the , which had been sunk by Soviet submarine S-13 to Kolberg. As the Red Army advanced on Kolberg, most of the inhabitants and tens of thousands of refugees from surrounding areas (about 70,000 were trapped in the Kolberg Pocket), as well as 40,000 German soldiers, were evacuated from the besieged city by German naval forces in Operation Hannibal. Only about two thousand soldiers were left on 17 March to cover the last sea transports.\n\nBetween 4 March and 18 March 1945, there were major battles between the Soviet and Polish forces and the German army. Because of a lack of anti-tank weapons, German destroyers used their guns to support the defenders of Kolberg until nearly all of the soldiers and civilians had been evacuated. During the fights, Polish soldiers' losses were 1013 dead, 142 MIA and 2652 wounded.Epoki Historyczne On 18 March, the Polish Army re-enacted Poland's Wedding to the Sea ceremony, which had been celebrated for the first time in 1920 by General Józef Haller.\n\nFile:Kolobrzeg c1890-1905 LOC 00729u.jpg|Kolberg between 1890 and 1905\nFile:Kolobrzeg1945.JPG|80% of the city destroyed in 1945\nFile:Kolobrzeg Ratuszowy Square from NW 2007-05.jpg|Ratuszowy Square, rebuilt Kolobrzeg in 2007\n\nPost-war\n\nAfter World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial compensation demanded by the Polish delegation for the territorial changes enforced by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles, some of whom expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.\n\nDemographics\n\nBefore the end of World War II the town was predominantly German Protestant with Polish and Jewish minorities. Since 1945, Polish Catholics make up the majority of the population. Around the turn from the 18th to the 19th century an increase of the number of Catholics was observed, because  military personnel  had been moved from West Prussia to the town. The mother tongue of a number of soldiers serving in the garrison of Kolberg was Polish. \n\nMillennium Memorial \n\nIn 2000 the city business council of Kołobrzeg commissioned a monument called the Millennium Memorial as a commemoration of \"1000 years of Christianity in Pomerania\", and as a tribute to Polish-German Reconciliation, celebrating the meeting of King Boleslaw I of Poland and King Otto III of Germany, at the Congress of Gniezno, in the year 1000.\n\nIt was designed and built by the artist Wiktor Szostalo in welded stainless steel. The two figures sit at the base of a 5-meter cross, cleft in two and being held together by a dove holding an olive branch. It is installed outside the Basilica Cathedral in the city center.\n\nTourist destination \n\nKołobrzeg today is a popular tourist destination for Poles, Germans and due to the ferry connection to Bornholm also Danish people. It provides a unique combination of a seaside resort, health resort, an old town full of historic monuments and tourist entertainment options (e.g. numerous \"beer gardens\").\n\nBike path to Podczele \n\nThe town is part of the European Route of Brick Gothic network. A bike path \"to Podczele\", located along the seaside was commissioned on July 14, 2004. The path extends from Kołobrzeg to Podczele. The path has been financed by the European Union, and is intended to be part of a unique biking path that will ultimately circle the entire Baltic Sea. The path has been breached on Mar 24, 2010 due to the encroachment of the sea associated with the draining of the adjacent unique Eco-Park marsh area. The government of Poland has allocated PLN 90,000 to repair the breach, and the path re-opened within a year. It was also extended in 2011 to connected with Ustronie Morskie 8 km to the east.\n\nOldest oak \n\nSouth of Bagicz, some 4 km from Kołobrzeg, there is an 806-year-old oak (2008). Dated in the year 2000 as the oldest oak in Poland, it was named Bolesław to commemorate the king Boleslaus the Brave.\n\nCultural center \n\nKołobrzeg is also a regional cultural center. In the summer take place - a number of concerts of popular singers, musicians, and cabaters. Municipal Cultural Center, is located in the Park teatralny.

In the town hall of Kołobrzeg is located Gallery of Modern Art, where exhibitions are exposed artists from Kołobrzeg, as well as outside the local artistic circles. Gallery also conducts educational activities, including organized by the gallery of art lessons for children and young people from schools.\n\nMuseums \n\nIn town, there is a museum of Polish weapons (Muzeum Oręża Polskiego), which are presented in the collections of militaria from the early Middle Ages to the present.

    "aggregatedText" : "Kołobrzeg (; ) is a city in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in north-western Poland with about 47,000 inhabitants (). Kołobrzeg is located on the Parsęta River on the south coast of the Baltic Sea (in the middle of the section divided by the Oder and Vistula Rivers). It has been the capital of Kołobrzeg County in West Pomeranian Voivodship since 1999, and was in Koszalin Voivodship from 1950 to 1998.\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Slavic Pomeranians founded a settlement at the site of modern Budzistowo. Thietmar of Merseburg first mentioned the site as Salsa Cholbergiensis. Around the year 1000, when the city was part of Poland, it became seat of the Diocese of Kołobrzeg. During the High Middle Ages, the town was expanded with an additional settlement a few kilometers north of the stronghold and chartered with Lübeck law. The city later joined the Hanseatic League. Within the Duchy of Pomerania, the town was the urban center of the secular reign of the prince-bishops of Cammin and their residence throughout the High and Late Middle Ages. When it was part of Brandenburgian Pomerania during the Early Modern Age, it withstood Polish and Napoleon's troops in the Siege of Kolberg. From 1815, it was part of the Prussian province of Pomerania. As the Nazis took power in Germany, the local Jewish population was discriminated against, determined to be subhuman and eventually subjected to genocide. In 1945 Polish and Soviet troops seized the town, while the remaining German population which had not fled the advancing Red Army was expelled. Kołobrzeg, now part of post-war Poland and devastated in the preceding Battle of Kolberg, was rebuilt but lost its status as the regional center to the nearby city of Koszalin.\n\nEtymology\n\n\"Kołobrzeg\" literally means \"by the shore\" in Polish: \"koło\" translates as \"by\" and \"brzeg\" translates as \"coast\" or \"shore\".  has a similar etymology. The original name of Cholberg was taken by Polish and Kashubian linguists in the 19th and 20th centuries to reconstruct the name. After German settlement, the original name of Cholberg  evolved into .\n\nHistory \n\nSlavic Pomeranian stronghold at modern Budzistowo \n\nAccording to Piskorski (1999) and Kempke (2001), Slavic immigration reached Farther Pomerania in the 7th century. First Slavic settlements in the vicinity of Kołobrzeg were centered around nearby deposits of salt and date to 6th and 7th century.Tadeusz Gasztold, Hieronim Kroczyński, Hieronim Rybicki, Kołobrzeg: zarys dziejów, Wydaw.

By the turn from the 10th to the 11th century, the smaller burghs in the Parseta area were given up. With the area coming under control of the Polish Duke Mieszko I, only two strongholds remained and underwent an enlargement, the one at Budzistowo and a predecessor of later Białogard (Belgard). These developments were most likely associated with the establishment of Polish power over this part of the Baltic coast. In the 10th century the trade of salt and fish led to the development of the settlement into a town.[http://miasto.kolobrzeg.eu/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id58:epoki-historyczne&catid\n37:historia&Itemid=78] ‘Historical eras’ Official webpage of the city\n\nPiast Poland and conversion \n\nDuring  Polish rule of the area in the late 10th century, the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg (975-1018) mentions salsa Cholbergiensis as the see of the Bishopric of Kołobrzeg, set up during the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 and placed under the Archdiocese of Gniezno. The congress was organized by Polish king Bolesław Chrobry and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, and also led to the establishment of bishoprics in Kraków and Wrocław, connecting the territories of the Polish state.

The stronghold was captured by the Polish army in the winter of 1107/08, when the inhabitants (cives et oppidani) including a duke (dux Pomeranorum) surrendered without resistance.Jörg Jarnut, Peter Johanek, Die Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt im 11.

The settlers received several privileges such as exemption from certain taxes and several benefits, making it difficult for the Slavic population to compete with Germans, and as result Slavs impoverished.\n\nHenceforth, the nearby former stronghold was turned into a village and renamed \"Old Town\"  (, , ), first documented in 1277 and used until 1945 when it was renamed \"Budzistowo\". A new St. Mary's church was built within the new town before the 1260s,Jörg Jarnut, Peter Johanek, Die Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt im 11. Jahrhundert, Köln-Weimar-Wien 1998, pp.273-305, republished in Winfried Schich, Ralf Gebuhr, Peter Neumeister, Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft - Siedlung und Wirtschaft im Bereich der Germania Slavica, BWV Verlag, 2007, p.280,  while St. Mary's in the former Pomeranian stronghold was turned into a nuns' abbey. In 1277 St. Benedict's monastery for nuns was founded, which in the framework of the Pomeranian Reformation  in 1545 was then changed into an educational institution  for noble Protestant ladies.Franz Manthey: Polnische Kirchengeschichte. Hildesheim 1965, p. 31.\n\nAlready in 1248, the Kammin bishops and the Pomeranian dukes had interchanged the terrae Stargard and Kolberg, leaving the bishops in charge of the latter. When in 1276 they became the souvereign of the town also, they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from nearby Köslin (Koszalin).Gerhard Köbler, Historisches Lexikon der Deutschen Länder: die deutschen Territorien vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart, 7th edition, C.H.Beck, 2007, p.113,  In 1345, the bishops became Imperial immediate dukes in their secular reign.\n\nIn 1361, Kolberg joined the Hanseatic League.\n\nWhen the property of the Bishopric of Kammin was secularized during the Protestant Reformation in 1534, their secular reign including the Kolberg area became intermediately ruled by a Lutheran titular bishop, before it was turned into a Sekundogenitur of the House of Pomerania.\n\nIn the 15th century the city traded with Scotland, Amsterdam and Scandinavia. Beer, salt,  honey, wool and flour were exported, while merchants imported textiles from England, southern fruits, and cod liver oil. In the 16th century, the city reached 5,000 inhabitants. According to the city's website, the Slavs in the city were discriminated, and their rights in trade and crafts were limited, with bans on performing certain types of professions and taking certain positions in the city\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Kolberg was occupied by imperial forces from 1627 to 1630, and thereafter by Swedish forces.\n\nModern era: In Prussia\n\nKolberg, with most of Farther Pomerania, was granted to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia and, after the signing of the Treaty of Stettin (1653), was part of the Province of Pomerania.  It became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.  In 1761, during the Seven Years' War, the town was captured after three subsequent sieges by the Russian commander Peter Rumyantsev.  At the end of the war, however, Kolberg was returned to Prussia.\n\nDuring Napoleon's invasion of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition, the town was besieged from mid-March to July 2, 1807, by the Grande Armée and by Polish forces drawn from insurgents against Prussian rule (a street named for the commander leading Polish soldiers is located within the present-day city).  The city's defense, led by then Lieutenant-Colonel August von Gneisenau, held out until the war was ended by the Treaty of Tilsit.  Kolberg became part of the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1815, after the final defeat of Napoleon; until 1872, it was administered within the Fürstenthum District (\"Principality District\", recalling the area's former special status), then it was within Landkreis Kolberg-Körlin.\nMarcin Dunin, archbishop of Poznań and Gniezno and Roman Catholic primate of Poland, was imprisoned by Prussian authorities for ten months in 1839-1840 in the cityPapiestwo wobec sprawy polskiej w latach 1772-1865:\nwybór źródel Otton Beiersdorf Zaklad Narodowy im.

A Nazi newspaper, the Kolberger Beobachter, listed Jewish shops and business that were to be boycotted.  Nazis also engaged in hate propaganda against Jewish lawyers, doctors, and craftsmen.\"Kołobrzeg – Historia\"Wirtualny Sztetl At the end of 1935, Jews were banned from working in the city's health spas. During Kristallnacht, the Jewish synagogue and homes were destroyed, and in 1938 the local Jewish cemetery was vandalised, while a cemetery shrine was turned to stable by German soldiers.[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/kolobrzeg/5,historia/?ver3 Kołobrzeg – Historia] Wirtualny Sztetl-Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich In 1938, all Jews in Kolberg, as all over Germany, were renamed in official German documents as \"Israel\" (for males) or \"Sarah\" (for females).  In the beginning of 1939, Jews were banned from attending German schools and the entire adult population had its driving licenses revoked.  After years of discrimination and harassment, local Jews were deported by the German authorities to concentration camps in 1940.\n\nSecond World War\n\nThe city website mentions that during the Second World War the German state brought in forced labour workers,  among them Poles. The city's economy  was changed to military production-especially after the German invasion of the  Soviet Union.[Epoki Historyczne http://miasto.kolobrzeg.eu/index.php?option\ncom_content&viewarticle&id\n58:epoki-historyczne&catid37:historia&Itemid\n78]\nThe forced labourers were threatened with everyday harassment and repression; they were forbidden from using phones, holding cultural events and sports events, they could not visit restaurants or swimming pools, or have contact with the local German population. Poles were only allowed to attend a church mass once a month - and only in the German language. They also had smaller food rations than Germans, and had to wear a sign with the letter P on their clothes indicating their ethnic background. Additionally, medical help for Polish workers was limited by the authorities. Arrests and imprisonment for various offences, such as \"slow pace of work\" or leaving the workspace, were everyday occurrences.Kołobrzeg: zarys dziejówb Tadeusz Gasztold, Hieronim Kroczyński, Hieronim Rybicki - 1979 - page 72\n\nIn 1944, the city was designated a \"stronghold\" (Festung) — Festung Kolberg. The 1807 siege was used for the last Nazi propaganda film, Kolberg shortly before the end of the war by Joseph Goebbels . It was meant to inspire the Germans with its depiction of the heroic Prussian defence during the Napoleonic Wars. Tremendous resources were devoted to filming this epic, even diverting tens of thousands of troops from the front lines to have them serve as extras in battle scenes. Ironically, the film was released in the final few weeks of Nazi Germany's existence, when most of the country's cinemas were already destroyed.\n\nOn 10 February 1945, the German torpedo-boat T-196 brought about 300 survivors of the , which had been sunk by Soviet submarine S-13 to Kolberg. As the Red Army advanced on Kolberg, most of the inhabitants and tens of thousands of refugees from surrounding areas (about 70,000 were trapped in the Kolberg Pocket), as well as 40,000 German soldiers, were evacuated from the besieged city by German naval forces in Operation Hannibal. Only about two thousand soldiers were left on 17 March to cover the last sea transports.\n\nBetween 4 March and 18 March 1945, there were major battles between the Soviet and Polish forces and the German army. Because of a lack of anti-tank weapons, German destroyers used their guns to support the defenders of Kolberg until nearly all of the soldiers and civilians had been evacuated. During the fights, Polish soldiers' losses were 1013 dead, 142 MIA and 2652 wounded.Epoki Historyczne On 18 March, the Polish Army re-enacted Poland's Wedding to the Sea ceremony, which had been celebrated for the first time in 1920 by General Józef Haller.\n\nFile:Kolobrzeg c1890-1905 LOC 00729u.jpg|Kolberg between 1890 and 1905\nFile:Kolobrzeg1945.JPG|80% of the city destroyed in 1945\nFile:Kolobrzeg Ratuszowy Square from NW 2007-05.jpg|Ratuszowy Square, rebuilt Kolobrzeg in 2007\n\nPost-war\n\nAfter World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial compensation demanded by the Polish delegation for the territorial changes enforced by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles, some of whom expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.\n\nDemographics\n\nBefore the end of World War II the town was predominantly German Protestant with Polish and Jewish minorities. Since 1945, Polish Catholics make up the majority of the population. Around the turn from the 18th to the 19th century an increase of the number of Catholics was observed, because  military personnel  had been moved from West Prussia to the town. The mother tongue of a number of soldiers serving in the garrison of Kolberg was Polish. \n\nMillennium Memorial \n\nIn 2000 the city business council of Kołobrzeg commissioned a monument called the Millennium Memorial as a commemoration of \"1000 years of Christianity in Pomerania\", and as a tribute to Polish-German Reconciliation, celebrating the meeting of King Boleslaw I of Poland and King Otto III of Germany, at the Congress of Gniezno, in the year 1000.\n\nIt was designed and built by the artist Wiktor Szostalo in welded stainless steel. The two figures sit at the base of a 5-meter cross, cleft in two and being held together by a dove holding an olive branch. It is installed outside the Basilica Cathedral in the city center.\n\nTourist destination \n\nKołobrzeg today is a popular tourist destination for Poles, Germans and due to the ferry connection to Bornholm also Danish people. It provides a unique combination of a seaside resort, health resort, an old town full of historic monuments and tourist entertainment options (e.g. numerous \"beer gardens\").\n\nBike path to Podczele \n\nThe town is part of the European Route of Brick Gothic network. A bike path \"to Podczele\", located along the seaside was commissioned on July 14, 2004. The path extends from Kołobrzeg to Podczele. The path has been financed by the European Union, and is intended to be part of a unique biking path that will ultimately circle the entire Baltic Sea. The path has been breached on Mar 24, 2010 due to the encroachment of the sea associated with the draining of the adjacent unique Eco-Park marsh area.
