  "textBody" : "Francis Scott Key (August 1, 1779January 11, 1843) was an American lawyer, author, and amateur poet from Frederick, Maryland and later Georgetown, D.C., near Washington, D.C. who wrote the lyrics for a poem entitled at first \"The Defence of Fort McHenry\", which when set to an old English gentlemen's society tune, eventually became the United States' national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\n\nEarly life and family\n\nFrancis Scott Key was born to Ann Phoebe Penn Dagworthy (Charlton) and Captain John Ross Key at the family plantation Terra Rubra in what was then part of Frederick County, now Carroll County, Maryland.[https://books.google.com/books?id-f3caYlJTw0C&pg\nPA8&dqFrancis+Scott+Key+John+Ross+Key&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwiwhNnxyubTAhXHLFAKHW03A6wQ6AEIJzAB#vonepage&q\nFrancis%20Scott%20Key%20John%20Ross%20Key&ffalse Francis Scott Key: Patriotic Poet] By Susan R.

He married Mary Tayloe Lloyd on January 1, 1802.\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Key, accompanied by the British Prisoner Exchange Agent Colonel John Stuart Skinner, dined aboard the British ship HMS Tonnant as the guests of three British officers: Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross. Skinner and Key were there to negotiate the release of prisoners, one of whom was Dr.William Beanes, a resident of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, who had been arrested after jailing marauding British troops who were looting local farms. Skinner, Key, and Beanes were not allowed to return to their own sloop because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the British units and with the British intent to attack Baltimore. Thus, Key was unable to do anything but watch the bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on the night of September 1314,1814.Hubbell, Jay B.

Back in Baltimore and inspired, Key wrote a poem about his experience, \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", which was soon published in William Pechin'sBaltimore Sunday Sun Magazine, Sept 13, 1964 American and Commercial Daily Advertiser on September21,1814. He took it to Thomas Carr, a music publisher, who adapted it to the rhythms of composer John Stafford Smith's \"To Anacreon in Heaven\", a popular tune Key had already used as a setting for his 1805-song \"When the Warrior Returns\", celebrating U.S. heroes of the First Barbary War.Mark Clague, Star-Spangled Mythbusting (June 5, 2014) at www.chorusamerica.org/singers/star-spangled-mythbusting (Key used the \"star-spangled\" flag imagery in the earlier song.)[http://www.potw.org/archive/potw340.html When the Warrior Returns – Key]. Potw.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-11. It has become better known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Though somewhat difficult to sing, it became increasingly popular, competing with \"Hail, Columbia\" (1796) as the de facto national anthem by the time of the Mexican–American War and American Civil War. More than a century after its first publication, the song was adopted as the American national anthem, first by an Executive Order from President Woodrow Wilson in1916 (which had little effect beyond requiring military bands to play what became known as the \"Service Version\") and then by a Congressional resolution in1931, signed by President Herbert Hoover.\n\nLegal career\n\nKey was a leading attorney in Frederick, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. for many years, with an extensive real estate as well as trial practice. He and his family settled in Georgetown in 1805 or 1806, near the new national capital. There the young Key assisted his uncle, the prominent lawyer Philip Barton Key, such as in the sensational conspiracy trial of Aaron Burr and the expulsion of Senator John Smith of Ohio. He made the first of his many arguments before the United States Supreme Court in 1807. In 1808 he assisted President Thomas Jefferson's attorney general in United Statesv.Peters.Leepson, pp. 16, 20-24\n\nIn 1829, Key, a supporter of Andrew Jackson, assisted in the prosecution of Tobias Watkins, former U.S.Treasury auditor under former President John Quincy Adams for misappropriating public monies. He also handled the Petticoat affair concerning Secretary of War John Eaton, who had married a widowed saloonkeeper.Leepson, pp. 116-122 In 1832, he served as the attorney for Sam Houston, then a former U.S. Representative and Governor of Tennessee, during his trial for assaulting Representative William Stanbery of Ohio.[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho73 Sam Houston]. Handbook of Texas Online.\n\nPresident Jackson nominated Key for United States Attorney for the District of Columbia in 1833. After the U.S. Senate approved the nomination, he served from 1833 to 1841, while also handling his own private legal cases. In 1835, in his most famous case, he prosecuted Richard Lawrence for his unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Andrew Jackson at the entrance doors and top steps of the Capitol, the first attempt to kill an American chief executive.\n\nSlavery and American Colonization Society\n\nKey purchased his first slave in 1800 or 1801 and owned six slaves in 1820.Leepson p. 25 Mostly in the 1830s, Key manumitted (set free) seven slaves, one of whom (Clem Johnson) continued to work for him for wages as his farm's foreman, supervising several slaves.Leepson pp. 130-131 post-Turner's rebellion emancipations of Romeo, William Ridout, Elizabeth Hicks, Clem Johnson.\n\nThroughout his career Key also represented several slaves seeking their freedom in court (for free), as well as several masters seeking return of their runaway slaves.Leepson pp. 125 (successful in freeing Harry Quando), Key, Judge William Leigh of Halifax, and bishop William Meade were administrators of the will of their friend John Randolph of Roanoke, who died without children and left a will directing his executors to free his more than four hundred slaves. Over the next decade, beginning in 1833, the administrators fought to enforce the will and provide the freed slaves land to support themselves.Leepson, p. 144\n\nKey publicly criticized slavery's cruelties, so much that after his death a newspaper editorial stated \"So actively hostile was he to the peculiar institution that he was called 'The Nigger Lawyer' .... because he often volunteered to defend the downtrodden sons and daughters of Africa. Mr.Key convinced me that slavery was wrong—radically wrong.\"Leepson p. 26 citing Cincinnati Daily Gazette July 11, 1870 In June 1842, Key attended the funeral of William Costin, a free, mixed race resident who had challenged Washington's surety bond laws.\n\nKey was a founding member and active leader of the American Colonization Society and its predecessor, the influential Maryland branch, the primary goal of which was to send free African-Americans back to Africa.\nHowever, he was removed from the board in 1833 as its policies shifted toward abolitionist.\n\nAnti-abolitionist\n\nKey used his position as U.S. Attorney to suppress abolitionists. In 1833, he secured a grand jury indictment against Benjamin Lundy, editor of the anti-slavery publication, the Genius of Universal Emancipation, and his printer, William Greer, for libel after Lundy published an article that declared, \"There is neither mercy nor justice for colored people in this district [of Columbia]\". Lundy's article, Key said in the indictment, \"was intended to injure, oppress, aggrieve, and vilify the good name, fame, credit & reputation of the Magistrates and constables\" of Washington. Lundy left town rather than face trial; Greer was acquitted.Morley, Jefferson, Snow-Storm In August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835 (Nan Talese/Doubleday, New York, 2012), 81\n\nIn August 1836, Key agreed to prosecute botanist and doctor Reuben Crandall, brother of controversial Connecticut school teacher Prudence Crandall, who had recently moved to the national capital. Key secured an indictment for \"seditious libel\" after two marshals (who operated as slave catchers in their off hours) found Crandall had a trunk full of anti-slavery publications in his Georgetown residence, five days after the Snow Riot, caused by rumors that a mentally ill slave had attempted to kill an elderly white woman. In an April 1837 trial that attracted nationwide attention, Key charged that Crandall's actions instigated slaves to rebel. Crandall's attorneys acknowledged he opposed slavery, but denied any intent or actions to encourage rebellion. Key, in his final address to the jury said:  The jury acquitted Crandall.Morley, Jefferson, Snow-Storm In August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835 (Nan Talese/Doubleday, New York, 2012), 211–220Leepson, pp. 169-72, 181-85\n\nThis defeat, as well as family tragedies in 1835, diminished Key's political ambition. He resigned as district attorney in 1840. He remained a staunch proponent of African colonization and a strong critic of the antislavery movement until his death.\n\nReligion\n\nKey was a devout and prominent Episcopalian. In his youth, he almost became an Episcopal priest rather than a lawyer. Throughout his life he sprinkled biblical references in his correspondence.Leepson, pp. x-xi. He was active in All Saints Parish in Frederick, Maryland, near his family's home. He also helped found or financially support several parishes in the new national capital, including St. John's Church in Georgetown and Christ Church in Alexandria.\n\nFrom 1818 until his death in 1843, Key was associated with the American Bible Society. He successfully opposed an abolitionist resolution presented to that group around 1838.\n\nKey also helped found two Episcopal seminaries, one in Baltimore and the other across the Potomac River in Alexandria, Virginia (the Virginia Theological Seminary). Key also published a prose work called The Power of Literature, and Its Connection with Religion in 1834.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nOn January 11, 1843, Key died at the home of his daughter Elizabeth Howard in Baltimore from pleurisy at age 63. He was initially interred in Old Saint Paul's Cemetery in the vault of John Eager Howard but in 1866, his body was moved to his family plot in Frederick at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\nThe Key Monument Association erected a memorial in 1898 and the remains of both Francis Scott Key and his wife, Mary Tayloe Lloyd, were placed in a crypt in the base of the monument.\n\nDespite several efforts to preserve it, the Francis Scott Key residence was ultimately dismantled in1947.

Retrieved on 2011-09-11.\n\nThough Key had written poetry from time to time, often with heavily religious themes, these works were not collected and published until 14years after his death. Two of his religious poems used as Christian hymns include \"Before the Lord We Bow\" and \"Lord, with Glowing Heart I'd Praise Thee\".http://www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/k/e/y/key_fs.htmhttp://www.hymntime.com/tch/\n\nIn1806, Key's sister, Anne Phoebe Charlton Key, married Roger B. Taney, who would later become Chief Justice of the United States. In 1846 one daughter, Alice, married U.S. Senator George H. Pendleton and another, Ellen Lloyd, married Simon F. Blunt. In1859 Key's son Philip Barton Key II was shot and killed by Daniel Sicklesa U.S.Representative from New York who would serve as a general in the American Civil Warafter he discovered that Philip Barton Key was having an affair with his wife. Sickles was acquitted in the first use of the temporary insanity defense. In1861 Key's grandson Francis Key Howard was imprisoned in Fort McHenry with the Mayor of Baltimore George William Brown and other locals deemed pro-South.\n\nKey was a distant cousin and the namesake of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose full name was Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald.

The first is the Francis Scott Key Bridge between the Rosslyn section of Arlington County, Virginia, and Georgetown in Washington, D.C. Scott's Georgetown home, which was dismantled in 1947 (as part of construction for the Whitehurst Freeway), was located on M Street NW, in the area between the Key Bridge and the intersection of M Street and Whitehurst Freeway.
