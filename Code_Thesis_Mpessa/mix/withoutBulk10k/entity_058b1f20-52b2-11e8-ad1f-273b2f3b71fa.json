  "textBody" : "The geometric algebra (GA) of a vector space is an algebra over a field, noted for its multiplication operation called the geometric product on a space of elements called multivectors, which is a superset of both the scalars F and the vector space V.  Mathematically, a geometric algebra may be defined as the Clifford algebra of a vector space with a quadratic form. Clifford's contribution was to define a new product, the geometric product, that united the Grassmann and Hamilton algebras into a single structure. Adding the dual of the Grassmann exterior product (the \"meet\") allows the use of the Grassmann–Cayley algebra (known as 3D projective space or 4D homogeneous space and isomorphic to projective geometry) and a conformal version of the latter together with a conformal Clifford algebra yields a conformal geometric algebra (CGA) providing a framework for classical geometries.  In practice, these and several derived operations allow a correspondence of elements, subspaces and operations of the algebra with geometric interpretations.\n\nThe scalars and vectors have their usual interpretation, and make up distinct subspaces of a GA. Bivectors provide a more natural representation of pseudovector quantities in vector algebra such as oriented area, oriented angle of rotation, torque, angular momentum, electromagnetic field and the Poynting vector.  A trivector can represent an oriented volume, and so on.  An element called a blade may be used to represent a subspace of V and orthogonal projections onto that subspace.  Rotations and reflections are represented as elements.  Unlike vector algebra, a GA naturally accommodates any number of dimensions and any quadratic form such as in relativity.\n\nSpecific examples of geometric algebras applied in physics include the spacetime algebra (or the less common alternative formulation, the algebra of physical space) and the conformal geometric algebra. Geometric calculus, an extension of GA that incorporates differentiation and integration, can be used to formulate other theories such as complex analysis, differential geometry, e.g. by using the Clifford algebra instead of differential forms.  Geometric algebra has been advocated, most notably by David Hestenes and Chris Doran, as the preferred mathematical framework for physics.  Proponents claim that it provides compact and intuitive descriptions in many areas including classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory and relativity. GA has also found use as a computational tool in computer graphics and robotics.\n\nThe geometric product was first briefly mentioned by Hermann Grassmann, who was chiefly interested in developing the closely related exterior algebra. In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford greatly expanded on Grassmann's work to form what are now usually called Clifford algebras in his honor (although Clifford himself chose to call them \"geometric algebras\").  For several decades, geometric algebras went somewhat ignored, greatly eclipsed by the vector calculus then newly developed to describe electromagnetism.  The term \"geometric algebra\" was repopularized by Hestenes in the 1960s, who advocated its importance to relativistic physics.\n\nDefinition and notation\n\nThere are a number of different ways to define a geometric or Clifford algebra. Hestenes original approach was axiomatic, \"full of geometric significance\" and equivalent to the universal Clifford algebra.\nGiven a finite-dimensional quadratic space V over a field F with a symmetric bilinear form (the inner product, e.g. the Euclidean or Lorentzian metric) g : V \\times V \\rightarrow F, the geometric algebra for this quadratic space is the geometric algebra \\operatorname{G}(V, g), together with the exterior algebra {\\textstyle \\bigwedge}V. Since it is usual in GA, for the remainder of this article, only the real case, F = \\mathbf{R}, will be considered. The notation \\mathcal G(p,q) or \\mathcal G_{n} will be used to describe the geometric algebra.\n\nThe essential product in the algebra is called the geometric product, and the product in the contained exterior algebra is called the exterior product (frequently called the outer product and less often the wedge).  It is standard to denote these respectively by juxtaposition (i.e., suppressing any explicit multiplication symbol) and the symbol \\wedge.  The above definition of the geometric algebra is abstract, so we summarize the properties of the geometric product by the following set of axioms.  The geometric product of \\mathcal G_{n} has the following properties for multivectors  A, B, C:\n\nAB \\in \\mathcal G_{n}\n1AA1\nA, where 1 is the unit and A any element of the algebra (existence of an identity element)\nA(BC)=(AB)C, where A, B and C are any elements of the algebra (associativity)\nA(B+C)AB+AC and (B+C)A\nBA+CA, where A, B and C are any elements of the algebra (distributivity)\na^2 = g(a,a)1, where a is any element of the subspace V of the algebra.(In other words, the geometric product aa is linked to the inner product a \\cdot a.)\n\nThe exterior product has the same properties, except that a \\wedge a = 0 for a \\in V.\n\nNote that in the final property above, the real number g(a,a) need not be nonnegative if g is not positive-definite.  An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements having a multiplicative inverse.  If a^2 \\ne 0  for some vector a, then a^{-1} exists and is equal to g(a,a)^{-1}a.  A nonzero element of the algebra does not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse. For example, if u is a vector in V such that u^2 = 1, the element \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u) is both a nontrivial idempotent element and a nonzero zero divisor, and thus has no inverse.\n\nIt is usual to identify 1 \\in \\mathbf{R} with 1 \\in \\operatorname{G}(V, g), with associated natural embeddings \\mathbf{R} \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g) and V \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g).  In this article, this identification is assumed.  Throughout, the term vector refers to an element of V (and its image under this embedding).\n\nThe Geometric Product\n\n  \nFor vectors a and b, we may write the geometric product of any two vectors a and b as the sum of a symmetric product and an antisymmetric product:\n\nab=\\frac{1}{2}(ab+ba)+\\frac{1}{2}(ab-ba)\n\nThus we can define the inner product of vectors as\n\na \\cdot b := g(a,b),\n\nso that the symmetric product can be written as\n\n\\frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) \\frac{1}{2}((a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2) \n a \\cdot b\n\nConversely, g is completely determined by the algebra. The antisymmetric part is the exterior product of the two vectors, the product of the contained exterior algebra:\n\na \\wedge b :\\frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) \n -(b \\wedge a)\n\nThen by simple addition:\n\nab=a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b  the ungeneralized or vector form of the geometric product.\n\nThe inner and exterior products are associated with familiar concepts from standard vector algebra.  Geometrically, a and b are parallel if their geometric product is equal to their inner product, whereas a and b are perpendicular if their geometric product is equal to their exterior product.  In a geometric algebra for which the square of any nonzero vector is positive, the inner product of two vectors can be identified with the dot product of standard vector algebra.  The exterior product of two vectors can be identified with the signed area enclosed by a parallelogram the sides of which are the vectors.  The cross product of two vectors in 3 dimensions with positive-definite quadratic form is closely related to their exterior product.\n\nMost instances of geometric algebras of interest have a nondegenerate quadratic form.  If the quadratic form is fully degenerate, the inner product of any two vectors is always zero, and the geometric algebra is then simply an exterior algebra.  Unless otherwise stated, this article will treat only nondegenerate geometric algebras.\n\nThe exterior product is naturally extended as an associative bilinear binary operator between any two elements of the algebra, satisfying the identities\n\n1 \\wedge a_i a_i \\wedge 1 \n a_i\na_1\\wedge a_2\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge a_r = \\frac{1}{r!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\mathfrak{S}_r} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) a_{\\sigma(1)}a_{\\sigma(2)} \\cdots a_{\\sigma(r)},\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of the indices, with \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) the sign of the permutation, and a_i are vectors (not general elements of the algebra).  Since every element of the algebra can be expressed as the sum of products of this form, this defines the exterior product for every pair of elements of the algebra.  It follows from the definition that the exterior product forms an alternating algebra.\n\nBlades, grades, and canonical basis\n\nA multivector that is the exterior product of r independent vectors (r \\le n) is called a blade, and the blade is said to be a multivector of grade r.  From the axioms, with closure, every multivector of the geometric algebra is a sum of blades.\n\nConsider a set of r independent vectors \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_r\\} spanning an r-dimensional subspace of the vector space.  With these, we can define a real symmetric matrix\n\n[\\mathbf{A}]_{ij}=a_i\\cdot a_j\n\nBy the spectral theorem, \\mathbf{A} can be diagonalized to diagonal matrix \\mathbf{D} by an orthogonal matrix \\mathbf{O} via\n\n\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}[\\mathbf{O}^{\\mathrm{T}}]_{lj}\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{O}]_{jl}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}\n[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}\n\nDefine a new set of vectors \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}, known as orthogonal basis vectors, to be those transformed by the orthogonal matrix:\n\ne_i=\\sum_j[\\mathbf{O}]_{ij}a_j\n\nSince orthogonal transformations preserve inner products, it follows that e_i\\cdot e_j=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij} and thus the \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\} are perpendicular.  In other words, the geometric product of two distinct vectors e_i \\ne e_j is completely specified by their exterior product, or more generally\n\n\\begin{array}{rl}e_1e_2\\cdots e_r &= e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_r \\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{1j}a_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{2j}a_j \\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{rj}a_j\\right) \\\\\n&= \\det [\\mathbf{O}] a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r \\end{array}\n\nTherefore, every blade of grade r can be written as a geometric product of r vectors.  More generally, if a degenerate geometric algebra is allowed, then the orthogonal matrix is replaced by a block matrix that is orthogonal in the nondegenerate block, and the diagonal matrix has zero-valued entries along the degenerate dimensions.  If the new vectors of the nondegenerate subspace are normalized according to\n\n\\hat{e}_i=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt}e_i,\n\nthen these normalized vectors must square to +1 or -1.  By Sylvester's law of inertia, the total number of +1s and the total number of -1s along the diagonal matrix is invariant.  By extension, the total number p of these vectors that square to +1 and the total number q that square to -1 is invariant.  (If the degenerate case is allowed, then the total number of basis vectors that square to zero is also invariant.)  We denote this algebra \\mathcal{G}(p,q).  For example, \\mathcal G(3,0) models 3-dimensional Euclidean space, \\mathcal G(1,3) relativistic spacetime and \\mathcal G(4,1) a conformal geometric algebra of a 3-dimensional space.\n\nThe set of all possible products of n orthogonal basis vectors with indices in increasing order, including 1 as the empty product, forms a basis for the entire geometric algebra (an analogue of the PBW theorem). For example, the following is a basis for the geometric algebra \\mathcal{G}(3,0):\n\\{1,e_1,e_2,e_3,e_1e_2,e_1e_3,e_2e_3,e_1e_2e_3\\}\nA basis formed this way is called a canonical basis for the geometric algebra, and any other orthogonal basis for V will produce another canonical basis. Each canonical basis consists of 2^n elements.  Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements.  If the canonical basis elements are \\{ B_i | i \\in S \\} with S being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is\n \\left( \\sum_i \\alpha_i B_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_j \\beta_j B_j \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_i\\beta_j B_i B_j .\n\nThe terminology \"k-vector\" is often encountered to describe multivectors containing elements of only one grade. In higher dimensional space, some such multivectors are not blades (cannot be factored into the outer product of k vectors). By way of example,  e_1 \\wedge e_2 + e_3 \\wedge e_4  in  R^4  cannot be factored; typically, however, such elements of the algebra do not yield to any geometric interpretation. Only  0,1,(n-1) and n-vectors are always blades in n-space.\n\nGrade projection\n\nUsing an orthogonal basis, a graded vector space structure can be established.  Elements of the geometric algebra that are scalar multiples of 1 are grade-0 blades and are called scalars.  Multivectors that are in the span of \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\} are grade-1 blades and are the ordinary vectors.  Multivectors in the span of \\{e_ie_j\\mid 1\\leq i are grade-2 blades and are the bivectors.  This terminology continues through to the last grade of n-vectors.  Alternatively, grade-n blades are called pseudoscalars, grade-(n-1) blades pseudovectors, etc.  Many of the elements of the algebra are not graded by this scheme since they are sums of elements of differing grade. Such elements are said to be of mixed grade.  The grading of multivectors is independent of the basis chosen originally.\n\nA multivector A may be decomposed with the grade-projection operator \\langle A \\rangle _r, which outputs the grade-r portion of A. As a result:\n\n A \\sum_{r\n0}^{n} \\langle A \\rangle _r \n\nAs an example, the geometric product of two vectors  a b a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b \n \\langle a b \\rangle_0 + \\langle a b \\rangle_2 since \\langle a b \\rangle_0a\\cdot b and \\langle a b \\rangle_2 \n a\\wedge b and \\langle a b \\rangle_i=0, for i other than 0 and 2.\n\nThe decomposition of a multivector A may also be split into those components that are even and those that are odd:\n\n A^{+} = \\langle A \\rangle _0 + \\langle A \\rangle _2 + \\langle A \\rangle _4 + \\cdots \n A^{-} = \\langle A \\rangle _1 + \\langle A \\rangle _3 + \\langle A \\rangle _5 + \\cdots \n\nThis makes the algebra a \\mathrm{Z}_2-graded algebra or superalgebra with the geometric product.  Since the geometric product of two even multivectors is an even multivector, they define an even subalgebra.  The even subalgebra of an n-dimensional geometric algebra is isomorphic to a full geometric algebra of (n-1) dimensions.  Examples include \\mathcal G^{+}(2,0) \\cong \\mathcal{G}(0,1) and \\mathcal{G}^{+}(1,3) \\cong \\mathcal G(3,0).\n\nRepresentation of subspaces\n\nGeometric algebra represents subspaces of V as blades, and so they coexist in the same algebra with vectors from V. A k-dimensional subspace W of V is represented by taking an orthogonal basis \\{b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_k\\} and using the geometric product to form the blade D = b_1b_2\\cdots b_k. There are multiple blades representing W; all those representing W are scalar multiples of D. These blades can be separated into two sets: positive multiples of D and negative multiples of D. The positive multiples of D are said to have the same orientation as D, and the negative multiples the opposite orientation.\n\nBlades are important since geometric operations such as projections, rotations and reflections depend on the factorability via the exterior product that (the restricted class of) n-blades provide but that (the generalized class of) grade-n multivectors do not when n \\ge 4.\n\nUnit pseudoscalars\n\nUnit pseudoscalars are blades that play important roles in GA. A unit pseudoscalar for a non-degenerate subspace W of V is a blade that is the product of the members of an orthonormal basis for W. It can be shown that if I and I' are both unit pseudoscalars for W, then I \\pm I' and I^2 \n \\pm 1.\n\nSuppose the geometric algebra \\mathcal{G}(n,0) with the familiar positive definite inner product on \\mathbf{R}^n is formed. Given a plane (2-dimensional subspace) of \\mathbf{R}^n, one can find an orthonormal basis \\{ b_1, b_2 \\} spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar I = b_1 b_2 representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of b_1 and b_2 lies in \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}, that is, it is the sum of a 0-vector and a 2-vector.\n\nBy the properties of the geometric product, I^2 b_1 b_2 b_1 b_2 \n -b_1 b_2 b_2 b_1 = -1. The resemblance to the imaginary unit is not incidental: the subspace  \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}  is \\mathbf{R}-algebra isomorphic to the complex numbers. In this way, a copy of the complex numbers is embedded in the geometric algebra for each 2-dimensional subspace of V on which the quadratic form is definite.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to -1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.\n\nIn \\mathcal{G}(3,0), a further familiar case occurs. Given a canonical basis consisting of orthonormal vectors e_i of V, the set of all 2-vectors is spanned by\n \\{ e_3 e_2 , e_1 e_3 , e_2 e_1 \\} .\nLabelling these i, j and k (momentarily deviating from our uppercase convention), the subspace generated by 0-vectors and 2-vectors is exactly  \\{ \\alpha_0 + i \\alpha_1 + j \\alpha_2 + k \\alpha_3 \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}. This set is seen to be a subalgebra, and furthermore is \\mathbf{R}-algebra isomorphic to the quaternions, another important algebraic system.\n\nDual basis\n\nLet \\{e_i\\} be a basis of V, i.e. a set of n linearly independent vectors that span the n-dimensional vector space V.  The basis that is dual to \\{e_i\\} is the set of elements of the dual vector space V^{*} that forms a biorthogonal system with this basis, thus being the elements denoted \\{e^i\\} satisfying\ne^i \\cdot e_j = \\delta^i{}_j,\nwhere \\delta is the Kronecker delta.\n\nGiven a nondegenerate quadratic form on V, V^{*} becomes naturally identified with V, and the dual basis may be regarded as elements of V, but are not in general the same set as the original basis.\n\nGiven further a GA of V, let \n \\epsilon = e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n\nbe the pseudoscalar (which does not necessarily square to \\pm 1) formed from the basis \\{e_i\\}.  The dual basis vectors may be constructed as\ne^i=(-1)^{i-1}(e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\check{e}_i \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n) \\epsilon^{-1},\nwhere the \\check{e}_i denotes that the ith basis vector is omitted from the product.\n\nExtensions of the inner and exterior products\n\nIt is common practice to extend the exterior product on vectors to the entire algebra. This may be done through the use of the grade projection operator:\n\nC \\wedge D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{r+s}      (the exterior product)\n\nThis generalization is consistent with the above definition involving antisymmetrization.  Another generalization related to the exterior product is the commutator product:\nC \\times D := \\tfrac{1}{2}(CD-DC) \n\nThe regressive product (usually referred to as the \"meet\") is the dual of the exterior product (or \"join\" in this context). The dual specification of elements permits, for blades A and B, the intersection (or meet) where the duality is to be taken relative to the smallest grade blade containing both A and B (the join).\n: C \\vee D := ((CI^{-1}) \\wedge (DI^{-1}))I \nwith I the unit pseudoscalar of the algebra.  The regressive product, like the exterior product, is associative.\n\nThe inner product on vectors can also be generalized, but in more than one non-equivalent way. The paper  gives a full treatment of several different inner products developed for geometric algebras and their interrelationships, and the notation is taken from there.  Many authors use the same symbol as for the inner product of vectors for their chosen extension (e.g. Hestenes and Perwass).  No consistent notation has emerged.\n\nAmong these several different generalizations of the inner product on vectors are:\n\n C \\;\\rfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{s-r}    (the left contraction)\n C \\;\\lfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{r-s}    (the right contraction)\n C * D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{0}    (the scalar product)\n C \\bullet D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_    (the \"(fat) dot\" product)\n\n makes an argument for the use of contractions in preference to Hestenes's inner product; they are algebraically more regular and have cleaner geometric interpretations. \nA number of identities incorporating the contractions are valid without restriction of their inputs.\nFor example,\n\n C \\;\\rfloor\\; D = ( C \\wedge ( D I^{-1} ) ) I \n C \\;\\lfloor\\; D = I ( ( I^{-1} C) \\wedge D ) \n ( A \\wedge B ) * C = A * ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) \n C * ( B \\wedge A ) = ( C \\;\\lfloor\\; B ) * A  \n A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) = ( A \\wedge B ) \\;\\rfloor\\; C .\n\nBenefits of using the left contraction as an extension of the inner product on vectors include that the identity  ab a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b  is extended to  aB \n a \\;\\rfloor\\; B + a \\wedge B for any vector a and multivector B, and that the projection operation  \\mathcal{P}_b (a) (a \\cdot b^{-1})b  is extended to  \\mathcal{P}_B (A) \n (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B for any blade B and any multivector A (with a minor modification to accommodate null B, given below).\n\nLinear functions\n\nAlthough versors are inherently more useful, they are a subgroup of linear functions on multivectors and these can still be used when necessary. The geometric algebra of an n-dimensional vector space is spanned by a basis of 2^n elements.  If a multivector is represented by a 2^n \\times 1 real column matrix in terms of a basis, then all linear transformations of the multivector can be expressed as the matrix multiplication by a 2^n \\times 2^n real matrix.  However, such a general linear transformation allows arbitrary exchanges among grades, such as a \"rotation\" of a scalar into a vector, which has no evident geometric interpretation.\n\nA general linear transformation from vectors to vectors is of interest.  With the natural restriction to preserving the induced exterior algebra, the outermorphism of the linear transformation is its unique extension.  If f is a linear function that maps vectors to vectors, then its outermorphism is the function that obeys the rule\n\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r) = f(a_1) \\wedge f(a_2) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge f(a_r)\nfor a blade, extended to the whole algebra through linearity.\n\nModeling Geometries\n\nAlthough a lot of attention has been placed on CGA in recent years, it is to be noted that GA is not just one algebra, it is one of a family of algebras with the same essential structure.\n\nVector Space Model\n\n\\mathcal G(3,0) may be considered as an extension or completion of vector algebra.\n\nThe even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(2,0) is isomorphic to the complex numbers, as may be seen by writing a vector P in terms of its components in an orthonormal basis and left multiplying by the basis vector e_1, yielding\n\n Z e_1 P \n e_1 ( x e_1 + y e_2) = x (1) + y ( e_1 e_2) ,\n\nwhere we identify i \\mapsto e_1e_2 since\n\n({e_1}{e_2})^2 {e_1}{e_2}{e_1}{e_2} \n -{e_1}{e_1}{e_2}{e_2} = -1 .\n\nSimilarly, the even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(3,0) with basis \\{1, e_2 e_3, e_3 e_1, e_1 e_2 \\} is isomorphic to the quaternions as may be seen by identifying i \\mapsto -e_2 e_3, j \\mapsto -e_3 e_1 and k \\mapsto -e_1 e_2.\n\nEvery associative algebra has a matrix representation; replacing the three Cartesian basis vectors by the Pauli matrices gives a representation of \\mathcal G(3,0):\n\\begin{align}\n e_1 \\sigma_1 \n \\sigma_x &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0&1\\\\\n      1&0\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n e_2 \\sigma_2 \n \\sigma_y &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0&-i\\\\\n      i&0\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n e_3 \\sigma_3 \n \\sigma_z &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      1&0\\\\\n      0&-1\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\,.\n\\end{align}\n\nDotting the \"Pauli vector\" (a dyad):\n\n\\sigma = \\sigma_1 e_1 + \\sigma_2 e_2 + \\sigma_3 e_3 with arbitrary vectors  a  and  b  and multiplying through gives:\n\n(\\sigma \\cdot a)(\\sigma \\cdot b) = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b   (Equivalently, by inspection,  a \\cdot b + i \\sigma \\cdot  ( a  ×  b ))\n\nSpacetime Model\n\nIn physics, the main applications are the geometric algebra of Minkowski 3+1 spacetime,  , called spacetime algebra (STA), or less commonly, , called the algebra of physical space (APS), where  is isomorphic to the even subalgebra of the 3+1 algebra, .\n\nWhile in STA points of spacetime are represented simply by vectors, in APS, points of (3+1)-dimensional spacetime are instead represented by paravectors: a 3-dimensional vector (space) plus a 1-dimensional scalar (time).\n\nIn spacetime algebra the electromagnetic field tensor has a bivector representation {F} ({E} + i c {B})\\gamma_0. Here, the i \n \\gamma_0 \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\gamma_3 is the unit pseudoscalar (or four-dimensional volume element), \\gamma_0 is the unit vector in time direction, and E and B are the classic electric and magnetic field vectors (with a zero time component). Using the four-current {J}, Maxwell's equations then become\n\nIn geometric calculus, juxtapositioning of vectors such as in DF indicate the geometric product and can be decomposed into parts as DFD\\cdot F+D\\wedge F. Here D is the covector derivative in any spacetime and reduces to \\nabla in flat spacetime. Where \\bigtriangledown plays a role in Minkowski 4-spacetime which is synonymous to the role of \\nabla in Euclidean 3-space and is related to the d'Alembertian by  \\Box\n\\bigtriangledown^2 . Indeed, given an observer represented by a future pointing timelike vector \\gamma_0 we have\n\n\\gamma_0\\cdot\\bigtriangledown=\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\n\n\\gamma_0\\wedge\\bigtriangledown=\\nabla\n\nBoosts in this Lorentzian metric space have the same expression e^ as rotation in Euclidean space, where {\\beta} is the bivector generated by the time and the space directions involved, whereas in the Euclidean case it is the bivector generated by the two space directions, strengthening the \"analogy\" to almost identity.\n\nThe Dirac matrices are a representation of \\mathcal G(1,3), showing the equivalence with matrix representations used by physicists.\n\nHomogeneous Model\n\nThe first model here is \\mathcal G(4,0), the GA version of homogeneous coordinates used in projective geometry. Here a vector represents a point and an outer product of vectors an oriented length yet we may work with the algebra in just the same way as in \\mathcal G(3,0). However, a useful inner product cannot be defined in the space and so there is no geometric product either leaving only outer product and non-metric uses of duality such as meet and join.\n\nNevertheless, there has been investigation of 4-dimensional alternatives to the full 5-dimensional CGA for limited geometries such as rigid body movements. A selection of these can be found in Part IV of Guide to Geometric Algebra in Practice . Note that the algebra \\mathcal G(3,0,1) appears as a subalgebra of CGA by selecting just one null vector and dropping the other and further that the “motor algebra” (isomorphic to dual quaternions) is the even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(3,0,1).\n\nIn a recent paper,  Dorst seeks a solution for expressing projective transformations in GA (usually handled via 4 by 4 coordinate matrices). In a postscript to that paper, reference is made to a further paper  that Dorst describes as resolving most of the weaknesses in this (research) area.\n\nConformal Model\n\nA compact description of the current state of the art is provided by , which also includes further references, in particular to .  Other useful references are  and .\n\nWorking within GA, Euclidean space \\mathcal E^3 is embedded projectively in the CGA \\mathcal G^{4,1} via the identification of Euclidean points with 1-d subspaces in the 4-d null cone of the 5-d CGA vector subspace, and adding a point at infinity.  This allows all conformal transformations to be done as rotations and reflections and is covariant, extending incidence relations of projective geometry to circles and spheres.\n\nSpecifically, we add orthogonal basis vectors  e_+  and  e_-  such that  {e_+}^2 +1  and  {e_-}^2 \n -1  to the basis of  \\mathcal{G}(3,0)  and identify null vectors\n n_{\\infty} = e_- + e_+  as an ideal point (point at infinity) (see Compactification) and\n n_\\text{o} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(e_- - e_+)  as the point at the origin, giving\n n_\\infty \\cdot n_\\text{o} = -1 .\n\nThis procedure has some similarities to the procedure for working with homogeneous coordinates in projective geometry and in this case allows the modeling of Euclidean transformations as orthogonal transformations.\n\nA fast changing and fluid area of GA, CGA is also being investigated for applications to relativistic physics.\n\nGeometric interpretation\n\nProjection and rejection\n\nFor any vector a and any invertible vector m,\n a amm^{-1} \n (a\\cdot m + a \\wedge m)m^{-1} = a_{\\| m} + a_{\\perp m} ,\nwhere the projection of a onto m (or the parallel part) is\n a_{\\| m} = (a \\cdot m)m^{-1} \nand the rejection of a from m (or the orthogonal part) is\n a_{\\perp m} a - a_{\\| m} \n (a\\wedge m)m^{-1} .\n\nUsing the concept of a k-blade B as representing a subspace of V and every multivector ultimately being expressed in terms of vectors, this generalizes to projection of a general multivector onto any invertible k-blade B as\n \\mathcal{P}_B (A) = (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B ,\nwith the rejection being defined as\n \\mathcal{P}_B^\\perp (A) = A - \\mathcal{P}_B (A) .\n\nThe projection and rejection generalize to null blades B by replacing the inverse B^{-1} with the pseudoinverse B^{+} with respect to the contractive product.  The outcome of the projection coincides in both cases for non-null blades.  For null blades B, the definition of the projection given here with the first contraction rather than the second being onto the pseudoinverse should be used, as only then is the result necessarily in the subspace represented by B.\nThe projection generalizes through linearity to general multivectors A.  The projection is not linear in B and does not generalize to objects B that are not blades.\n\nReflection\n\nSimple reflections in a hyperplane are readily expressed in the algebra through conjugation with a single vector.  These serve to generate the group of general rotoreflections and rotations.\n\nThe reflection c' of a vector c along a vector m, or equivalently in the hyperplane orthogonal to m, is the same as negating the component of a vector parallel to m.  The result of the reflection will be \n c' {-c_{\\| m} + c_{\\perp m}} \n {-(c \\cdot m)m^{-1} + (c \\wedge m)m^{-1}}\n= {(-m \\cdot c - m \\wedge c)m^{-1}}\n= -mcm^{-1} \n\nThis is not the most general operation that may be regarded as a reflection when the dimension n \\ge 4.  A general reflection may be expressed as the composite of any odd number of single-axis reflections.  Thus, a general reflection a' of a vector a may be written\n a \\mapsto a' = -MaM^{-1} ,\nwhere\n M pq \\cdots r and  M^{-1} \n (pq \\cdots r)^{-1} = r^{-1} \\cdots q^{-1}p^{-1} .\n\nIf we define the reflection along a non-null vector m of the product of vectors as the reflection of every vector in the product along the same vector, we get for any product of an odd number of vectors that, by way of example,\n (abc)' a'b'c' \n (-mam^{-1})(-mbm^{-1})(-mcm^{-1}) -ma(m^{-1}m)b(m^{-1}m)cm^{-1} \n -mabcm^{-1} \\,\nand for the product of an even number of vectors that\n (abcd)' a'b'c'd' \n (-mam^{-1})(-mbm^{-1})(-mcm^{-1})(-mdm^{-1}) = mabcdm^{-1} .\n\nUsing the concept of every multivector ultimately being expressed in terms of vectors, the reflection of a general multivector A using any reflection versor M may be written\n A \\mapsto M\\alpha(A)M^{-1} ,\nwhere \\alpha is the automorphism of reflection through the origin of the vector space (v \\mapsto -v) extended through linearity to the whole algebra.\n\nRotations\n\nIf we have a product of vectors R = a_1a_2 \\cdots a_r then we denote the reverse as\n\nR^\\dagger (a_1a_2\\cdots a_r)^\\dagger \n a_r\\cdots a_2 a_1.\n\nAs an example, assume that  R = ab  we get\nRR^\\dagger abba \n ab^2a a^2b^2 \n ba^2b baab \n R^\\dagger R.\n\nScaling R so that RR^\\dagger = 1 then\n\n(RvR^\\dagger)^2 Rv^{2}R^\\dagger \n v^2RR^\\dagger = v^2 \n\nso RvR^\\dagger leaves the length of v unchanged. We can also show that\n\n(Rv_1R^\\dagger) \\cdot (Rv_2 R^\\dagger) = v_1 \\cdot v_2\n\nso the transformation RvR^\\dagger preserves both length and angle.  It therefore can be identified as a rotation or rotoreflection; R is called a rotor if it is a proper rotation (as it is if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of vectors) and is an instance of what is known in GA as a versor.\n\nThere is a general method for rotating a vector involving the formation of a multivector of the form  R = e^{-B \\theta / 2}  that produces a rotation  \\theta  in the plane and with the orientation defined by a 2-blade  B .\n\nRotors are a generalization of quaternions to n-dimensional spaces.\n\nVersor\n\nA k-versor is a multivector represented by the geometric product of k invertible vectors. Unit quaternions (originally called versors by Hamilton) may be identified with rotors in 3D space in much the same way as real 2D rotors subsume complex numbers, for the details refer to Dorst \n\nSome authors use the term “versor product” to refer to the frequently occurring case where an operand is \"sandwiched\" between operators. The descriptions for rotations and reflections, including their outermorphisms, are examples of such sandwiching. The outermorphisms have a particularly simple algebraic form.  Specifically, a mapping of vectors of the form\n\n V \\to V : a \\mapsto RaR^{-1} extends to the outermorphism \\mathcal{G}(V) \\to \\mathcal{G}(V) : A \\mapsto RAR^{-1}.\n\nSince both operators and operand are versors there is potential for alternative examples such as rotating a rotor or reflecting a spinor always provided that some geometrical or physical significance can be attached to such operations.\n\nBy the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem we have that every isometry can be given as reflections in hyperplanes and since composed reflections provide rotations then we have that orthogonal transformations are versors.\n\nIn group terms, for a real, non-degenerate \\mathcal G(p,q), having identified the group \\mathcal G^X as the group of all invertible elements of \\mathcal G, Lundholm gives a proof that the \"versor group\" { v_1v_2....v_k \\in G:V_i \\in V^X (set of invertible vectors)} is equal to the Lipschitz group \\Gamma (aka Clifford group, although Lundholm deprecates this usage).\n\nSubgroups of \\Gamma\n\nLundholm defines the Pin, Spin, and Spin+ subgroups, generated by unit vectors, and in the case of Spin and Spin+, only an even number of such vector factors can be present .\n\nSpinors are defined as elements of the even subalgebra of a real GA; an analysis of the GA approach to spinors is given by Francis and Kosowsky .\n\nExamples and applications\n\nHypervolume of a parallelotope spanned by vectors\n\nFor vectors  a  and  b  spanning a parallelogram we have\n a \\wedge b ((a \\wedge b) b^{-1}) b \n a_{\\perp b} b \nwith the result that  a \\wedge b is linear in the product of the \"altitude\" and the \"base\" of the parallelogram, that is, its area.\n\nSimilar interpretations are true for any number of vectors spanning an n-dimensional parallelotope; the exterior product of vectors a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_n, that is \\textstyle \\bigwedge_{i=1}^n a_i , has a magnitude equal to the volume of the n-parallelotope. An n-vector does not necessarily have a shape of a parallelotope – this is a convenient visualization. It could be any shape, although the volume equals that of the parallelotope.\n\nIntersection of a line and a plane\n\nWe may define the line parametrically by  p = t + \\alpha \\ v  where p and t are position vectors for points T and P and v is the direction vector for the line.\n\nThen\nB \\wedge (p-q) 0 and B \\wedge (t + \\alpha v - q) \n 0\nso\n\\alpha = \\frac{B \\wedge(q-t)}{B \\wedge v} \nand\np = t + \\left(\\frac{B \\wedge (q-t)}{B \\wedge v}\\right) v. \n\nRotating systems\n\nThe mathematical description of rotational forces such as torque and angular momentum often makes use of the cross product of vector calculus in three dimensions with a convention of orientation (handedness).\n\nThe cross product can be viewed in terms of the exterior product allowing a more natural geometric interpretation of the cross product as a bivector using the dual relationship\n\na \\times b = -I (a \\wedge b) .\n\nFor example, torque is generally defined as the magnitude of the perpendicular force component times distance, or work per unit angle.\n\nSuppose a circular path in an arbitrary plane containing orthonormal vectors \\hat{u} and \\hat{v} is parameterized by angle.\n\n\\mathbf{r} r(\\hat{u} \\cos \\theta + \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta) \n r \\hat{u}(\\cos \\theta + \\hat{u} \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta)\n\nBy designating the unit bivector of this plane as the imaginary number\n\n{i} \\hat{u} \\hat{v} \n \\hat{u} \\wedge \\hat{v}\ni^2 = -1 \n\nthis path vector can be conveniently written in complex exponential form\n\n \\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{ u} e^{i\\theta} \n\nand the derivative with respect to angle is\n\n \\frac{d  \\mathbf{r}}{d\\theta} r \\hat{u} i e^{i\\theta} \n \\mathbf{r} i .\n\nSo the torque, the rate of change of work W, due to a force F, is\n\n \\tau \\frac{dW}{d\\theta} \n F \\cdot \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} =  F \\cdot (\\mathbf{r} i) .\n\nUnlike the cross product description of torque,  \\tau =  \\mathbf{r} \\times  F, the geometric algebra description does not introduce a vector in the normal direction; a vector that does not exist in two and that is not unique in greater than three dimensions.  The unit bivector describes the plane and the orientation of the rotation, and the sense of the rotation is relative to the angle between the vectors {\\hat{u}} and {\\hat{v}}.\n\nGeometric calculus\n\nGeometric calculus extends the formalism to include differentiation and integration including differential geometry and differential forms.\n\nEssentially, the vector derivative is defined so that the GA version of Green's theorem is true,\n\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f\nand then one can write\n\\nabla f = \\nabla \\cdot f + \\nabla \\wedge f\nas a geometric product, effectively generalizing Stokes' theorem (including the differential form version of it).\n\nIn 1D when A is a curve with endpoints a and b, then\n\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f\nreduces to\n\\int_a^b dx \\, \\nabla f \\int_a^b dx \\cdot \\nabla f \n \\int_a^b df = f(b) -f(a)\nor the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.\n\nAlso developed are the concept of vector manifold and geometric integration theory (which generalizes Cartan's differential forms).\n\nHistory\n\n;Before the 20th century\n\nAlthough the connection of geometry with algebra dates as far back at least to Euclid's Elements in the third century B.C. (see Greek geometric algebra), GA in the sense used in this article was not developed until 1844, when it was used in a systematic way to describe the geometrical properties and transformations of a space.  In that year, Hermann Grassmann introduced the idea of a geometrical algebra in full generality as a certain calculus (analogous to the propositional calculus) that encoded all of the geometrical information of a space.  Grassmann's algebraic system could be applied to a number of different kinds of spaces, the chief among them being Euclidean space, affine space, and projective space.  Following Grassmann, in 1878 William Kingdon Clifford examined Grassmann's algebraic system alongside the quaternions of William Rowan Hamilton in .  From his point of view, the quaternions described certain transformations (which he called rotors), whereas Grassmann's algebra described certain properties (or Strecken such as length, area, and volume).  His contribution was to define a new product — the geometric product – on an existing Grassmann algebra, which realized the quaternions as living within that algebra.  Subsequently, Rudolf Lipschitz in 1886 generalized Clifford's interpretation of the quaternions and applied them to the geometry of rotations in n dimensions.  Later these developments would lead other 20th-century mathematicians to formalize and explore the properties of the Clifford algebra.\n\nNevertheless, another revolutionary development of the 19th-century would completely overshadow the geometric algebras: that of vector analysis, developed independently by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside.  Vector analysis was motivated by James Clerk Maxwell's studies of electromagnetism, and specifically the need to express and manipulate conveniently certain differential equations.  Vector analysis had a certain intuitive appeal compared to the rigors of the new algebras.  Physicists and mathematicians alike readily adopted it as their geometrical toolkit of choice, particularly following the influential 1901 textbook Vector Analysis by Edwin Bidwell Wilson, following lectures of Gibbs.\n\nIn more detail, there have been three approaches to geometric algebra: quaternionic analysis, initiated by Hamilton in 1843 and geometrized as rotors by Clifford in 1878; geometric algebra, initiated by Grassmann in 1844; and vector analysis, developed out of quaternionic analysis in the late 19th century by Gibbs and Heaviside. The legacy of quaternionic analysis in vector analysis can be seen in the use of i, j, k to indicate the basis vectors of \\mathbf{R}^3: it is being thought of as the purely imaginary quaternions. From the perspective of geometric algebra, quaternions can be identified as , the even part of the Clifford algebra on Euclidean 3-space, which unifies the three approaches.\n\n;20th century and present\n\nProgress on the study of Clifford algebras quietly advanced through the twentieth century, although largely due to the work of abstract algebraists such as Hermann Weyl and Claude Chevalley. The geometrical approach to geometric algebras has seen a number of 20th-century revivals.  In mathematics, Emil Artin's Geometric Algebra discusses the algebra associated with each of a number of geometries, including affine geometry, projective geometry, symplectic geometry, and orthogonal geometry.  In physics, geometric algebras have been revived as a \"new\" way to do classical mechanics and electromagnetism, together with more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and gauge theory. David Hestenes reinterpreted the Pauli and Dirac matrices as vectors in ordinary space and spacetime, respectively, and has been a primary contemporary advocate for the use of geometric algebra.\n\nIn computer graphics and robotics, geometric algebras have been revived in order to efficiently represent rotations and other transformations. For applications of GA in robotics (screw theory, kinematics and dynamics using versors), computer vision, control and neural computing (geometric learning) see Bayro (2010).\n\nSoftware\n\nGA is a very application-oriented subject.

    "aggregatedText" : "The geometric algebra (GA) of a vector space is an algebra over a field, noted for its multiplication operation called the geometric product on a space of elements called multivectors, which is a superset of both the scalars F and the vector space V.  Mathematically, a geometric algebra may be defined as the Clifford algebra of a vector space with a quadratic form. Clifford's contribution was to define a new product, the geometric product, that united the Grassmann and Hamilton algebras into a single structure. Adding the dual of the Grassmann exterior product (the \"meet\") allows the use of the Grassmann–Cayley algebra (known as 3D projective space or 4D homogeneous space and isomorphic to projective geometry) and a conformal version of the latter together with a conformal Clifford algebra yields a conformal geometric algebra (CGA) providing a framework for classical geometries.  In practice, these and several derived operations allow a correspondence of elements, subspaces and operations of the algebra with geometric interpretations.\n\nThe scalars and vectors have their usual interpretation, and make up distinct subspaces of a GA. Bivectors provide a more natural representation of pseudovector quantities in vector algebra such as oriented area, oriented angle of rotation, torque, angular momentum, electromagnetic field and the Poynting vector.  A trivector can represent an oriented volume, and so on.  An element called a blade may be used to represent a subspace of V and orthogonal projections onto that subspace.  Rotations and reflections are represented as elements.  Unlike vector algebra, a GA naturally accommodates any number of dimensions and any quadratic form such as in relativity.\n\nSpecific examples of geometric algebras applied in physics include the spacetime algebra (or the less common alternative formulation, the algebra of physical space) and the conformal geometric algebra. Geometric calculus, an extension of GA that incorporates differentiation and integration, can be used to formulate other theories such as complex analysis, differential geometry, e.g. by using the Clifford algebra instead of differential forms.  Geometric algebra has been advocated, most notably by David Hestenes and Chris Doran, as the preferred mathematical framework for physics.  Proponents claim that it provides compact and intuitive descriptions in many areas including classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory and relativity. GA has also found use as a computational tool in computer graphics and robotics.\n\nThe geometric product was first briefly mentioned by Hermann Grassmann, who was chiefly interested in developing the closely related exterior algebra. In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford greatly expanded on Grassmann's work to form what are now usually called Clifford algebras in his honor (although Clifford himself chose to call them \"geometric algebras\").  For several decades, geometric algebras went somewhat ignored, greatly eclipsed by the vector calculus then newly developed to describe electromagnetism.  The term \"geometric algebra\" was repopularized by Hestenes in the 1960s, who advocated its importance to relativistic physics.\n\nDefinition and notation\n\nThere are a number of different ways to define a geometric or Clifford algebra. Hestenes original approach was axiomatic, \"full of geometric significance\" and equivalent to the universal Clifford algebra.\nGiven a finite-dimensional quadratic space V over a field F with a symmetric bilinear form (the inner product, e.g. the Euclidean or Lorentzian metric) g : V \\times V \\rightarrow F, the geometric algebra for this quadratic space is the geometric algebra \\operatorname{G}(V, g), together with the exterior algebra {\\textstyle \\bigwedge}V. Since it is usual in GA, for the remainder of this article, only the real case, F = \\mathbf{R}, will be considered. The notation \\mathcal G(p,q) or \\mathcal G_{n} will be used to describe the geometric algebra.\n\nThe essential product in the algebra is called the geometric product, and the product in the contained exterior algebra is called the exterior product (frequently called the outer product and less often the wedge).  It is standard to denote these respectively by juxtaposition (i.e., suppressing any explicit multiplication symbol) and the symbol \\wedge.  The above definition of the geometric algebra is abstract, so we summarize the properties of the geometric product by the following set of axioms.  The geometric product of \\mathcal G_{n} has the following properties for multivectors  A, B, C:\n\nAB \\in \\mathcal G_{n}\n1AA1\nA, where 1 is the unit and A any element of the algebra (existence of an identity element)\nA(BC)=(AB)C, where A, B and C are any elements of the algebra (associativity)\nA(B+C)AB+AC and (B+C)A\nBA+CA, where A, B and C are any elements of the algebra (distributivity)\na^2 = g(a,a)1, where a is any element of the subspace V of the algebra.(In other words, the geometric product aa is linked to the inner product a \\cdot a.)\n\nThe exterior product has the same properties, except that a \\wedge a = 0 for a \\in V.\n\nNote that in the final property above, the real number g(a,a) need not be nonnegative if g is not positive-definite.  An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements having a multiplicative inverse.  If a^2 \\ne 0  for some vector a, then a^{-1} exists and is equal to g(a,a)^{-1}a.  A nonzero element of the algebra does not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse. For example, if u is a vector in V such that u^2 = 1, the element \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u) is both a nontrivial idempotent element and a nonzero zero divisor, and thus has no inverse.\n\nIt is usual to identify 1 \\in \\mathbf{R} with 1 \\in \\operatorname{G}(V, g), with associated natural embeddings \\mathbf{R} \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g) and V \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g).  In this article, this identification is assumed.  Throughout, the term vector refers to an element of V (and its image under this embedding).\n\nThe Geometric Product\n\n  \nFor vectors a and b, we may write the geometric product of any two vectors a and b as the sum of a symmetric product and an antisymmetric product:\n\nab=\\frac{1}{2}(ab+ba)+\\frac{1}{2}(ab-ba)\n\nThus we can define the inner product of vectors as\n\na \\cdot b := g(a,b),\n\nso that the symmetric product can be written as\n\n\\frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) \\frac{1}{2}((a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2) \n a \\cdot b\n\nConversely, g is completely determined by the algebra. The antisymmetric part is the exterior product of the two vectors, the product of the contained exterior algebra:\n\na \\wedge b :\\frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) \n -(b \\wedge a)\n\nThen by simple addition:\n\nab=a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b  the ungeneralized or vector form of the geometric product.\n\nThe inner and exterior products are associated with familiar concepts from standard vector algebra.  Geometrically, a and b are parallel if their geometric product is equal to their inner product, whereas a and b are perpendicular if their geometric product is equal to their exterior product.  In a geometric algebra for which the square of any nonzero vector is positive, the inner product of two vectors can be identified with the dot product of standard vector algebra.  The exterior product of two vectors can be identified with the signed area enclosed by a parallelogram the sides of which are the vectors.  The cross product of two vectors in 3 dimensions with positive-definite quadratic form is closely related to their exterior product.\n\nMost instances of geometric algebras of interest have a nondegenerate quadratic form.  If the quadratic form is fully degenerate, the inner product of any two vectors is always zero, and the geometric algebra is then simply an exterior algebra.  Unless otherwise stated, this article will treat only nondegenerate geometric algebras.\n\nThe exterior product is naturally extended as an associative bilinear binary operator between any two elements of the algebra, satisfying the identities\n\n1 \\wedge a_i a_i \\wedge 1 \n a_i\na_1\\wedge a_2\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge a_r = \\frac{1}{r!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\mathfrak{S}_r} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) a_{\\sigma(1)}a_{\\sigma(2)} \\cdots a_{\\sigma(r)},\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of the indices, with \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) the sign of the permutation, and a_i are vectors (not general elements of the algebra).  Since every element of the algebra can be expressed as the sum of products of this form, this defines the exterior product for every pair of elements of the algebra.  It follows from the definition that the exterior product forms an alternating algebra.\n\nBlades, grades, and canonical basis\n\nA multivector that is the exterior product of r independent vectors (r \\le n) is called a blade, and the blade is said to be a multivector of grade r.  From the axioms, with closure, every multivector of the geometric algebra is a sum of blades.\n\nConsider a set of r independent vectors \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_r\\} spanning an r-dimensional subspace of the vector space.  With these, we can define a real symmetric matrix\n\n[\\mathbf{A}]_{ij}=a_i\\cdot a_j\n\nBy the spectral theorem, \\mathbf{A} can be diagonalized to diagonal matrix \\mathbf{D} by an orthogonal matrix \\mathbf{O} via\n\n\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}[\\mathbf{O}^{\\mathrm{T}}]_{lj}\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{O}]_{jl}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}\n[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}\n\nDefine a new set of vectors \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}, known as orthogonal basis vectors, to be those transformed by the orthogonal matrix:\n\ne_i=\\sum_j[\\mathbf{O}]_{ij}a_j\n\nSince orthogonal transformations preserve inner products, it follows that e_i\\cdot e_j=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij} and thus the \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\} are perpendicular.  In other words, the geometric product of two distinct vectors e_i \\ne e_j is completely specified by their exterior product, or more generally\n\n\\begin{array}{rl}e_1e_2\\cdots e_r &= e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_r \\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{1j}a_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{2j}a_j \\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{rj}a_j\\right) \\\\\n&= \\det [\\mathbf{O}] a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r \\end{array}\n\nTherefore, every blade of grade r can be written as a geometric product of r vectors.  More generally, if a degenerate geometric algebra is allowed, then the orthogonal matrix is replaced by a block matrix that is orthogonal in the nondegenerate block, and the diagonal matrix has zero-valued entries along the degenerate dimensions.  If the new vectors of the nondegenerate subspace are normalized according to\n\n\\hat{e}_i=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt}e_i,\n\nthen these normalized vectors must square to +1 or -1.  By Sylvester's law of inertia, the total number of +1s and the total number of -1s along the diagonal matrix is invariant.  By extension, the total number p of these vectors that square to +1 and the total number q that square to -1 is invariant.  (If the degenerate case is allowed, then the total number of basis vectors that square to zero is also invariant.)  We denote this algebra \\mathcal{G}(p,q).  For example, \\mathcal G(3,0) models 3-dimensional Euclidean space, \\mathcal G(1,3) relativistic spacetime and \\mathcal G(4,1) a conformal geometric algebra of a 3-dimensional space.\n\nThe set of all possible products of n orthogonal basis vectors with indices in increasing order, including 1 as the empty product, forms a basis for the entire geometric algebra (an analogue of the PBW theorem). For example, the following is a basis for the geometric algebra \\mathcal{G}(3,0):\n\\{1,e_1,e_2,e_3,e_1e_2,e_1e_3,e_2e_3,e_1e_2e_3\\}\nA basis formed this way is called a canonical basis for the geometric algebra, and any other orthogonal basis for V will produce another canonical basis. Each canonical basis consists of 2^n elements.  Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements.  If the canonical basis elements are \\{ B_i | i \\in S \\} with S being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is\n \\left( \\sum_i \\alpha_i B_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_j \\beta_j B_j \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_i\\beta_j B_i B_j .\n\nThe terminology \"k-vector\" is often encountered to describe multivectors containing elements of only one grade. In higher dimensional space, some such multivectors are not blades (cannot be factored into the outer product of k vectors). By way of example,  e_1 \\wedge e_2 + e_3 \\wedge e_4  in  R^4  cannot be factored; typically, however, such elements of the algebra do not yield to any geometric interpretation. Only  0,1,(n-1) and n-vectors are always blades in n-space.\n\nGrade projection\n\nUsing an orthogonal basis, a graded vector space structure can be established.  Elements of the geometric algebra that are scalar multiples of 1 are grade-0 blades and are called scalars.  Multivectors that are in the span of \\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\} are grade-1 blades and are the ordinary vectors.  Multivectors in the span of \\{e_ie_j\\mid 1\\leq i are grade-2 blades and are the bivectors.  This terminology continues through to the last grade of n-vectors.  Alternatively, grade-n blades are called pseudoscalars, grade-(n-1) blades pseudovectors, etc.  Many of the elements of the algebra are not graded by this scheme since they are sums of elements of differing grade. Such elements are said to be of mixed grade.  The grading of multivectors is independent of the basis chosen originally.\n\nA multivector A may be decomposed with the grade-projection operator \\langle A \\rangle _r, which outputs the grade-r portion of A. As a result:\n\n A \\sum_{r\n0}^{n} \\langle A \\rangle _r \n\nAs an example, the geometric product of two vectors  a b a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b \n \\langle a b \\rangle_0 + \\langle a b \\rangle_2 since \\langle a b \\rangle_0a\\cdot b and \\langle a b \\rangle_2 \n a\\wedge b and \\langle a b \\rangle_i=0, for i other than 0 and 2.\n\nThe decomposition of a multivector A may also be split into those components that are even and those that are odd:\n\n A^{+} = \\langle A \\rangle _0 + \\langle A \\rangle _2 + \\langle A \\rangle _4 + \\cdots \n A^{-} = \\langle A \\rangle _1 + \\langle A \\rangle _3 + \\langle A \\rangle _5 + \\cdots \n\nThis makes the algebra a \\mathrm{Z}_2-graded algebra or superalgebra with the geometric product.  Since the geometric product of two even multivectors is an even multivector, they define an even subalgebra.  The even subalgebra of an n-dimensional geometric algebra is isomorphic to a full geometric algebra of (n-1) dimensions.  Examples include \\mathcal G^{+}(2,0) \\cong \\mathcal{G}(0,1) and \\mathcal{G}^{+}(1,3) \\cong \\mathcal G(3,0).\n\nRepresentation of subspaces\n\nGeometric algebra represents subspaces of V as blades, and so they coexist in the same algebra with vectors from V. A k-dimensional subspace W of V is represented by taking an orthogonal basis \\{b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_k\\} and using the geometric product to form the blade D = b_1b_2\\cdots b_k. There are multiple blades representing W; all those representing W are scalar multiples of D. These blades can be separated into two sets: positive multiples of D and negative multiples of D. The positive multiples of D are said to have the same orientation as D, and the negative multiples the opposite orientation.\n\nBlades are important since geometric operations such as projections, rotations and reflections depend on the factorability via the exterior product that (the restricted class of) n-blades provide but that (the generalized class of) grade-n multivectors do not when n \\ge 4.\n\nUnit pseudoscalars\n\nUnit pseudoscalars are blades that play important roles in GA. A unit pseudoscalar for a non-degenerate subspace W of V is a blade that is the product of the members of an orthonormal basis for W. It can be shown that if I and I' are both unit pseudoscalars for W, then I \\pm I' and I^2 \n \\pm 1.\n\nSuppose the geometric algebra \\mathcal{G}(n,0) with the familiar positive definite inner product on \\mathbf{R}^n is formed. Given a plane (2-dimensional subspace) of \\mathbf{R}^n, one can find an orthonormal basis \\{ b_1, b_2 \\} spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar I = b_1 b_2 representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of b_1 and b_2 lies in \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}, that is, it is the sum of a 0-vector and a 2-vector.\n\nBy the properties of the geometric product, I^2 b_1 b_2 b_1 b_2 \n -b_1 b_2 b_2 b_1 = -1. The resemblance to the imaginary unit is not incidental: the subspace  \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}  is \\mathbf{R}-algebra isomorphic to the complex numbers. In this way, a copy of the complex numbers is embedded in the geometric algebra for each 2-dimensional subspace of V on which the quadratic form is definite.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to -1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.\n\nIn \\mathcal{G}(3,0), a further familiar case occurs. Given a canonical basis consisting of orthonormal vectors e_i of V, the set of all 2-vectors is spanned by\n \\{ e_3 e_2 , e_1 e_3 , e_2 e_1 \\} .\nLabelling these i, j and k (momentarily deviating from our uppercase convention), the subspace generated by 0-vectors and 2-vectors is exactly  \\{ \\alpha_0 + i \\alpha_1 + j \\alpha_2 + k \\alpha_3 \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}. This set is seen to be a subalgebra, and furthermore is \\mathbf{R}-algebra isomorphic to the quaternions, another important algebraic system.\n\nDual basis\n\nLet \\{e_i\\} be a basis of V, i.e. a set of n linearly independent vectors that span the n-dimensional vector space V.  The basis that is dual to \\{e_i\\} is the set of elements of the dual vector space V^{*} that forms a biorthogonal system with this basis, thus being the elements denoted \\{e^i\\} satisfying\ne^i \\cdot e_j = \\delta^i{}_j,\nwhere \\delta is the Kronecker delta.\n\nGiven a nondegenerate quadratic form on V, V^{*} becomes naturally identified with V, and the dual basis may be regarded as elements of V, but are not in general the same set as the original basis.\n\nGiven further a GA of V, let \n \\epsilon = e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n\nbe the pseudoscalar (which does not necessarily square to \\pm 1) formed from the basis \\{e_i\\}.  The dual basis vectors may be constructed as\ne^i=(-1)^{i-1}(e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\check{e}_i \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n) \\epsilon^{-1},\nwhere the \\check{e}_i denotes that the ith basis vector is omitted from the product.\n\nExtensions of the inner and exterior products\n\nIt is common practice to extend the exterior product on vectors to the entire algebra. This may be done through the use of the grade projection operator:\n\nC \\wedge D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{r+s}      (the exterior product)\n\nThis generalization is consistent with the above definition involving antisymmetrization.  Another generalization related to the exterior product is the commutator product:\nC \\times D := \\tfrac{1}{2}(CD-DC) \n\nThe regressive product (usually referred to as the \"meet\") is the dual of the exterior product (or \"join\" in this context). The dual specification of elements permits, for blades A and B, the intersection (or meet) where the duality is to be taken relative to the smallest grade blade containing both A and B (the join).\n: C \\vee D := ((CI^{-1}) \\wedge (DI^{-1}))I \nwith I the unit pseudoscalar of the algebra.  The regressive product, like the exterior product, is associative.\n\nThe inner product on vectors can also be generalized, but in more than one non-equivalent way. The paper  gives a full treatment of several different inner products developed for geometric algebras and their interrelationships, and the notation is taken from there.  Many authors use the same symbol as for the inner product of vectors for their chosen extension (e.g. Hestenes and Perwass).  No consistent notation has emerged.\n\nAmong these several different generalizations of the inner product on vectors are:\n\n C \\;\\rfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{s-r}    (the left contraction)\n C \\;\\lfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{r-s}    (the right contraction)\n C * D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{0}    (the scalar product)\n C \\bullet D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_    (the \"(fat) dot\" product)\n\n makes an argument for the use of contractions in preference to Hestenes's inner product; they are algebraically more regular and have cleaner geometric interpretations. \nA number of identities incorporating the contractions are valid without restriction of their inputs.\nFor example,\n\n C \\;\\rfloor\\; D = ( C \\wedge ( D I^{-1} ) ) I \n C \\;\\lfloor\\; D = I ( ( I^{-1} C) \\wedge D ) \n ( A \\wedge B ) * C = A * ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) \n C * ( B \\wedge A ) = ( C \\;\\lfloor\\; B ) * A  \n A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) = ( A \\wedge B ) \\;\\rfloor\\; C .\n\nBenefits of using the left contraction as an extension of the inner product on vectors include that the identity  ab a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b  is extended to  aB \n a \\;\\rfloor\\; B + a \\wedge B for any vector a and multivector B, and that the projection operation  \\mathcal{P}_b (a) (a \\cdot b^{-1})b  is extended to  \\mathcal{P}_B (A) \n (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B for any blade B and any multivector A (with a minor modification to accommodate null B, given below).\n\nLinear functions\n\nAlthough versors are inherently more useful, they are a subgroup of linear functions on multivectors and these can still be used when necessary. The geometric algebra of an n-dimensional vector space is spanned by a basis of 2^n elements.  If a multivector is represented by a 2^n \\times 1 real column matrix in terms of a basis, then all linear transformations of the multivector can be expressed as the matrix multiplication by a 2^n \\times 2^n real matrix.  However, such a general linear transformation allows arbitrary exchanges among grades, such as a \"rotation\" of a scalar into a vector, which has no evident geometric interpretation.\n\nA general linear transformation from vectors to vectors is of interest.  With the natural restriction to preserving the induced exterior algebra, the outermorphism of the linear transformation is its unique extension.  If f is a linear function that maps vectors to vectors, then its outermorphism is the function that obeys the rule\n\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r) = f(a_1) \\wedge f(a_2) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge f(a_r)\nfor a blade, extended to the whole algebra through linearity.\n\nModeling Geometries\n\nAlthough a lot of attention has been placed on CGA in recent years, it is to be noted that GA is not just one algebra, it is one of a family of algebras with the same essential structure.\n\nVector Space Model\n\n\\mathcal G(3,0) may be considered as an extension or completion of vector algebra.\n\nThe even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(2,0) is isomorphic to the complex numbers, as may be seen by writing a vector P in terms of its components in an orthonormal basis and left multiplying by the basis vector e_1, yielding\n\n Z e_1 P \n e_1 ( x e_1 + y e_2) = x (1) + y ( e_1 e_2) ,\n\nwhere we identify i \\mapsto e_1e_2 since\n\n({e_1}{e_2})^2 {e_1}{e_2}{e_1}{e_2} \n -{e_1}{e_1}{e_2}{e_2} = -1 .\n\nSimilarly, the even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(3,0) with basis \\{1, e_2 e_3, e_3 e_1, e_1 e_2 \\} is isomorphic to the quaternions as may be seen by identifying i \\mapsto -e_2 e_3, j \\mapsto -e_3 e_1 and k \\mapsto -e_1 e_2.\n\nEvery associative algebra has a matrix representation; replacing the three Cartesian basis vectors by the Pauli matrices gives a representation of \\mathcal G(3,0):\n\\begin{align}\n e_1 \\sigma_1 \n \\sigma_x &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0&1\\\\\n      1&0\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n e_2 \\sigma_2 \n \\sigma_y &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0&-i\\\\\n      i&0\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n e_3 \\sigma_3 \n \\sigma_z &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      1&0\\\\\n      0&-1\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\,.\n\\end{align}\n\nDotting the \"Pauli vector\" (a dyad):\n\n\\sigma = \\sigma_1 e_1 + \\sigma_2 e_2 + \\sigma_3 e_3 with arbitrary vectors  a  and  b  and multiplying through gives:\n\n(\\sigma \\cdot a)(\\sigma \\cdot b) = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b   (Equivalently, by inspection,  a \\cdot b + i \\sigma \\cdot  ( a  ×  b ))\n\nSpacetime Model\n\nIn physics, the main applications are the geometric algebra of Minkowski 3+1 spacetime,  , called spacetime algebra (STA), or less commonly, , called the algebra of physical space (APS), where  is isomorphic to the even subalgebra of the 3+1 algebra, .\n\nWhile in STA points of spacetime are represented simply by vectors, in APS, points of (3+1)-dimensional spacetime are instead represented by paravectors: a 3-dimensional vector (space) plus a 1-dimensional scalar (time).\n\nIn spacetime algebra the electromagnetic field tensor has a bivector representation {F} ({E} + i c {B})\\gamma_0. Here, the i \n \\gamma_0 \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\gamma_3 is the unit pseudoscalar (or four-dimensional volume element), \\gamma_0 is the unit vector in time direction, and E and B are the classic electric and magnetic field vectors (with a zero time component). Using the four-current {J}, Maxwell's equations then become\n\nIn geometric calculus, juxtapositioning of vectors such as in DF indicate the geometric product and can be decomposed into parts as DFD\\cdot F+D\\wedge F. Here D is the covector derivative in any spacetime and reduces to \\nabla in flat spacetime. Where \\bigtriangledown plays a role in Minkowski 4-spacetime which is synonymous to the role of \\nabla in Euclidean 3-space and is related to the d'Alembertian by  \\Box\n\\bigtriangledown^2 . Indeed, given an observer represented by a future pointing timelike vector \\gamma_0 we have\n\n\\gamma_0\\cdot\\bigtriangledown=\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\n\n\\gamma_0\\wedge\\bigtriangledown=\\nabla\n\nBoosts in this Lorentzian metric space have the same expression e^ as rotation in Euclidean space, where {\\beta} is the bivector generated by the time and the space directions involved, whereas in the Euclidean case it is the bivector generated by the two space directions, strengthening the \"analogy\" to almost identity.\n\nThe Dirac matrices are a representation of \\mathcal G(1,3), showing the equivalence with matrix representations used by physicists.\n\nHomogeneous Model\n\nThe first model here is \\mathcal G(4,0), the GA version of homogeneous coordinates used in projective geometry. Here a vector represents a point and an outer product of vectors an oriented length yet we may work with the algebra in just the same way as in \\mathcal G(3,0). However, a useful inner product cannot be defined in the space and so there is no geometric product either leaving only outer product and non-metric uses of duality such as meet and join.\n\nNevertheless, there has been investigation of 4-dimensional alternatives to the full 5-dimensional CGA for limited geometries such as rigid body movements. A selection of these can be found in Part IV of Guide to Geometric Algebra in Practice . Note that the algebra \\mathcal G(3,0,1) appears as a subalgebra of CGA by selecting just one null vector and dropping the other and further that the “motor algebra” (isomorphic to dual quaternions) is the even subalgebra of \\mathcal G(3,0,1).\n\nIn a recent paper,  Dorst seeks a solution for expressing projective transformations in GA (usually handled via 4 by 4 coordinate matrices). In a postscript to that paper, reference is made to a further paper  that Dorst describes as resolving most of the weaknesses in this (research) area.\n\nConformal Model\n\nA compact description of the current state of the art is provided by , which also includes further references, in particular to .  Other useful references are  and .\n\nWorking within GA, Euclidean space \\mathcal E^3 is embedded projectively in the CGA \\mathcal G^{4,1} via the identification of Euclidean points with 1-d subspaces in the 4-d null cone of the 5-d CGA vector subspace, and adding a point at infinity.  This allows all conformal transformations to be done as rotations and reflections and is covariant, extending incidence relations of projective geometry to circles and spheres.\n\nSpecifically, we add orthogonal basis vectors  e_+  and  e_-  such that  {e_+}^2 +1  and  {e_-}^2 \n -1  to the basis of  \\mathcal{G}(3,0)  and identify null vectors\n n_{\\infty} = e_- + e_+  as an ideal point (point at infinity) (see Compactification) and\n n_\\text{o} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(e_- - e_+)  as the point at the origin, giving\n n_\\infty \\cdot n_\\text{o} = -1 .\n\nThis procedure has some similarities to the procedure for working with homogeneous coordinates in projective geometry and in this case allows the modeling of Euclidean transformations as orthogonal transformations.\n\nA fast changing and fluid area of GA, CGA is also being investigated for applications to relativistic physics.\n\nGeometric interpretation\n\nProjection and rejection\n\nFor any vector a and any invertible vector m,\n a amm^{-1} \n (a\\cdot m + a \\wedge m)m^{-1} = a_{\\| m} + a_{\\perp m} ,\nwhere the projection of a onto m (or the parallel part) is\n a_{\\| m} = (a \\cdot m)m^{-1} \nand the rejection of a from m (or the orthogonal part) is\n a_{\\perp m} a - a_{\\| m} \n (a\\wedge m)m^{-1} .\n\nUsing the concept of a k-blade B as representing a subspace of V and every multivector ultimately being expressed in terms of vectors, this generalizes to projection of a general multivector onto any invertible k-blade B as\n \\mathcal{P}_B (A) = (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B ,\nwith the rejection being defined as\n \\mathcal{P}_B^\\perp (A) = A - \\mathcal{P}_B (A) .\n\nThe projection and rejection generalize to null blades B by replacing the inverse B^{-1} with the pseudoinverse B^{+} with respect to the contractive product.  The outcome of the projection coincides in both cases for non-null blades.  For null blades B, the definition of the projection given here with the first contraction rather than the second being onto the pseudoinverse should be used, as only then is the result necessarily in the subspace represented by B.\nThe projection generalizes through linearity to general multivectors A.  The projection is not linear in B and does not generalize to objects B that are not blades.\n\nReflection\n\nSimple reflections in a hyperplane are readily expressed in the algebra through conjugation with a single vector.  These serve to generate the group of general rotoreflections and rotations.\n\nThe reflection c' of a vector c along a vector m, or equivalently in the hyperplane orthogonal to m, is the same as negating the component of a vector parallel to m.  The result of the reflection will be \n c' {-c_{\\| m} + c_{\\perp m}} \n {-(c \\cdot m)m^{-1} + (c \\wedge m)m^{-1}}\n= {(-m \\cdot c - m \\wedge c)m^{-1}}\n= -mcm^{-1} \n\nThis is not the most general operation that may be regarded as a reflection when the dimension n \\ge 4.  A general reflection may be expressed as the composite of any odd number of single-axis reflections.  Thus, a general reflection a' of a vector a may be written\n a \\mapsto a' = -MaM^{-1} ,\nwhere\n M pq \\cdots r and  M^{-1} \n (pq \\cdots r)^{-1} = r^{-1} \\cdots q^{-1}p^{-1} .\n\nIf we define the reflection along a non-null vector m of the product of vectors as the reflection of every vector in the product along the same vector, we get for any product of an odd number of vectors that, by way of example,\n (abc)' a'b'c' \n (-mam^{-1})(-mbm^{-1})(-mcm^{-1}) -ma(m^{-1}m)b(m^{-1}m)cm^{-1} \n -mabcm^{-1} \\,\nand for the product of an even number of vectors that\n (abcd)' a'b'c'd' \n (-mam^{-1})(-mbm^{-1})(-mcm^{-1})(-mdm^{-1}) = mabcdm^{-1} .\n\nUsing the concept of every multivector ultimately being expressed in terms of vectors, the reflection of a general multivector A using any reflection versor M may be written\n A \\mapsto M\\alpha(A)M^{-1} ,\nwhere \\alpha is the automorphism of reflection through the origin of the vector space (v \\mapsto -v) extended through linearity to the whole algebra.\n\nRotations\n\nIf we have a product of vectors R = a_1a_2 \\cdots a_r then we denote the reverse as\n\nR^\\dagger (a_1a_2\\cdots a_r)^\\dagger \n a_r\\cdots a_2 a_1.\n\nAs an example, assume that  R = ab  we get\nRR^\\dagger abba \n ab^2a a^2b^2 \n ba^2b baab \n R^\\dagger R.\n\nScaling R so that RR^\\dagger = 1 then\n\n(RvR^\\dagger)^2 Rv^{2}R^\\dagger \n v^2RR^\\dagger = v^2 \n\nso RvR^\\dagger leaves the length of v unchanged. We can also show that\n\n(Rv_1R^\\dagger) \\cdot (Rv_2 R^\\dagger) = v_1 \\cdot v_2\n\nso the transformation RvR^\\dagger preserves both length and angle.  It therefore can be identified as a rotation or rotoreflection; R is called a rotor if it is a proper rotation (as it is if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of vectors) and is an instance of what is known in GA as a versor.\n\nThere is a general method for rotating a vector involving the formation of a multivector of the form  R = e^{-B \\theta / 2}  that produces a rotation  \\theta  in the plane and with the orientation defined by a 2-blade  B .\n\nRotors are a generalization of quaternions to n-dimensional spaces.\n\nVersor\n\nA k-versor is a multivector represented by the geometric product of k invertible vectors. Unit quaternions (originally called versors by Hamilton) may be identified with rotors in 3D space in much the same way as real 2D rotors subsume complex numbers, for the details refer to Dorst \n\nSome authors use the term “versor product” to refer to the frequently occurring case where an operand is \"sandwiched\" between operators. The descriptions for rotations and reflections, including their outermorphisms, are examples of such sandwiching. The outermorphisms have a particularly simple algebraic form.  Specifically, a mapping of vectors of the form\n\n V \\to V : a \\mapsto RaR^{-1} extends to the outermorphism \\mathcal{G}(V) \\to \\mathcal{G}(V) : A \\mapsto RAR^{-1}.\n\nSince both operators and operand are versors there is potential for alternative examples such as rotating a rotor or reflecting a spinor always provided that some geometrical or physical significance can be attached to such operations.\n\nBy the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem we have that every isometry can be given as reflections in hyperplanes and since composed reflections provide rotations then we have that orthogonal transformations are versors.\n\nIn group terms, for a real, non-degenerate \\mathcal G(p,q), having identified the group \\mathcal G^X as the group of all invertible elements of \\mathcal G, Lundholm gives a proof that the \"versor group\" { v_1v_2....v_k \\in G:V_i \\in V^X (set of invertible vectors)} is equal to the Lipschitz group \\Gamma (aka Clifford group, although Lundholm deprecates this usage).\n\nSubgroups of \\Gamma\n\nLundholm defines the Pin, Spin, and Spin+ subgroups, generated by unit vectors, and in the case of Spin and Spin+, only an even number of such vector factors can be present .\n\nSpinors are defined as elements of the even subalgebra of a real GA; an analysis of the GA approach to spinors is given by Francis and Kosowsky .\n\nExamples and applications\n\nHypervolume of a parallelotope spanned by vectors\n\nFor vectors  a  and  b  spanning a parallelogram we have\n a \\wedge b ((a \\wedge b) b^{-1}) b \n a_{\\perp b} b \nwith the result that  a \\wedge b is linear in the product of the \"altitude\" and the \"base\" of the parallelogram, that is, its area.\n\nSimilar interpretations are true for any number of vectors spanning an n-dimensional parallelotope; the exterior product of vectors a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_n, that is \\textstyle \\bigwedge_{i=1}^n a_i , has a magnitude equal to the volume of the n-parallelotope. An n-vector does not necessarily have a shape of a parallelotope – this is a convenient visualization. It could be any shape, although the volume equals that of the parallelotope.\n\nIntersection of a line and a plane\n\nWe may define the line parametrically by  p = t + \\alpha \\ v  where p and t are position vectors for points T and P and v is the direction vector for the line.\n\nThen\nB \\wedge (p-q) 0 and B \\wedge (t + \\alpha v - q) \n 0\nso\n\\alpha = \\frac{B \\wedge(q-t)}{B \\wedge v} \nand\np = t + \\left(\\frac{B \\wedge (q-t)}{B \\wedge v}\\right) v. \n\nRotating systems\n\nThe mathematical description of rotational forces such as torque and angular momentum often makes use of the cross product of vector calculus in three dimensions with a convention of orientation (handedness).\n\nThe cross product can be viewed in terms of the exterior product allowing a more natural geometric interpretation of the cross product as a bivector using the dual relationship\n\na \\times b = -I (a \\wedge b) .\n\nFor example, torque is generally defined as the magnitude of the perpendicular force component times distance, or work per unit angle.\n\nSuppose a circular path in an arbitrary plane containing orthonormal vectors \\hat{u} and \\hat{v} is parameterized by angle.\n\n\\mathbf{r} r(\\hat{u} \\cos \\theta + \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta) \n r \\hat{u}(\\cos \\theta + \\hat{u} \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta)\n\nBy designating the unit bivector of this plane as the imaginary number\n\n{i} \\hat{u} \\hat{v} \n \\hat{u} \\wedge \\hat{v}\ni^2 = -1 \n\nthis path vector can be conveniently written in complex exponential form\n\n \\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{ u} e^{i\\theta} \n\nand the derivative with respect to angle is\n\n \\frac{d  \\mathbf{r}}{d\\theta} r \\hat{u} i e^{i\\theta} \n \\mathbf{r} i .\n\nSo the torque, the rate of change of work W, due to a force F, is\n\n \\tau \\frac{dW}{d\\theta} \n F \\cdot \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} =  F \\cdot (\\mathbf{r} i) .\n\nUnlike the cross product description of torque,  \\tau =  \\mathbf{r} \\times  F, the geometric algebra description does not introduce a vector in the normal direction; a vector that does not exist in two and that is not unique in greater than three dimensions.  The unit bivector describes the plane and the orientation of the rotation, and the sense of the rotation is relative to the angle between the vectors {\\hat{u}} and {\\hat{v}}.\n\nGeometric calculus\n\nGeometric calculus extends the formalism to include differentiation and integration including differential geometry and differential forms.\n\nEssentially, the vector derivative is defined so that the GA version of Green's theorem is true,\n\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f\nand then one can write\n\\nabla f = \\nabla \\cdot f + \\nabla \\wedge f\nas a geometric product, effectively generalizing Stokes' theorem (including the differential form version of it).\n\nIn 1D when A is a curve with endpoints a and b, then\n\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f\nreduces to\n\\int_a^b dx \\, \\nabla f \\int_a^b dx \\cdot \\nabla f \n \\int_a^b df = f(b) -f(a)\nor the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.\n\nAlso developed are the concept of vector manifold and geometric integration theory (which generalizes Cartan's differential forms).\n\nHistory\n\n;Before the 20th century\n\nAlthough the connection of geometry with algebra dates as far back at least to Euclid's Elements in the third century B.C. (see Greek geometric algebra), GA in the sense used in this article was not developed until 1844, when it was used in a systematic way to describe the geometrical properties and transformations of a space.  In that year, Hermann Grassmann introduced the idea of a geometrical algebra in full generality as a certain calculus (analogous to the propositional calculus) that encoded all of the geometrical information of a space.  Grassmann's algebraic system could be applied to a number of different kinds of spaces, the chief among them being Euclidean space, affine space, and projective space.  Following Grassmann, in 1878 William Kingdon Clifford examined Grassmann's algebraic system alongside the quaternions of William Rowan Hamilton in .  From his point of view, the quaternions described certain transformations (which he called rotors), whereas Grassmann's algebra described certain properties (or Strecken such as length, area, and volume).  His contribution was to define a new product — the geometric product – on an existing Grassmann algebra, which realized the quaternions as living within that algebra.  Subsequently, Rudolf Lipschitz in 1886 generalized Clifford's interpretation of the quaternions and applied them to the geometry of rotations in n dimensions.  Later these developments would lead other 20th-century mathematicians to formalize and explore the properties of the Clifford algebra.\n\nNevertheless, another revolutionary development of the 19th-century would completely overshadow the geometric algebras: that of vector analysis, developed independently by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside.  Vector analysis was motivated by James Clerk Maxwell's studies of electromagnetism, and specifically the need to express and manipulate conveniently certain differential equations.  Vector analysis had a certain intuitive appeal compared to the rigors of the new algebras.  Physicists and mathematicians alike readily adopted it as their geometrical toolkit of choice, particularly following the influential 1901 textbook Vector Analysis by Edwin Bidwell Wilson, following lectures of Gibbs.\n\nIn more detail, there have been three approaches to geometric algebra: quaternionic analysis, initiated by Hamilton in 1843 and geometrized as rotors by Clifford in 1878; geometric algebra, initiated by Grassmann in 1844; and vector analysis, developed out of quaternionic analysis in the late 19th century by Gibbs and Heaviside. The legacy of quaternionic analysis in vector analysis can be seen in the use of i, j, k to indicate the basis vectors of \\mathbf{R}^3: it is being thought of as the purely imaginary quaternions. From the perspective of geometric algebra, quaternions can be identified as , the even part of the Clifford algebra on Euclidean 3-space, which unifies the three approaches.\n\n;20th century and present\n\nProgress on the study of Clifford algebras quietly advanced through the twentieth century, although largely due to the work of abstract algebraists such as Hermann Weyl and Claude Chevalley. The geometrical approach to geometric algebras has seen a number of 20th-century revivals.  In mathematics, Emil Artin's Geometric Algebra discusses the algebra associated with each of a number of geometries, including affine geometry, projective geometry, symplectic geometry, and orthogonal geometry.  In physics, geometric algebras have been revived as a \"new\" way to do classical mechanics and electromagnetism, together with more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and gauge theory. David Hestenes reinterpreted the Pauli and Dirac matrices as vectors in ordinary space and spacetime, respectively, and has been a primary contemporary advocate for the use of geometric algebra.\n\nIn computer graphics and robotics, geometric algebras have been revived in order to efficiently represent rotations and other transformations. For applications of GA in robotics (screw theory, kinematics and dynamics using versors), computer vision, control and neural computing (geometric learning) see Bayro (2010).\n\nSoftware\n\nGA is a very application-oriented subject. There is a reasonably steep initial learning curve associated with it, but this can be eased somewhat by the use of applicable software.\n\nThe following is a list of freely available software that does not require ownership of commercial software or purchase of any commercial products for this purpose:\n* GA Viewer [http://www.geometricalgebra.net/downloads.html Fontijne, Dorst, Bouma & Mann]\n* [https://github.com/brombo/galgebra galgebra] - Symbolic Geometric Algebra Module for Python by Alan Bromborsky (uses sympy). \n* [https://clifford.readthedocs.io/ clifford]  - Numeric Geometric Algebra Module for Python.\n\nThe link provides a manual, introduction to GA and sample material as well as the software.\n* CLUViz [http://www.clucalc.info/ Perwass]\nSoftware allowing script creation and including sample visualizations, manual and GA introduction.\n* Gaigen Fontijne\nFor programmers, this is a code generator with support for C, C++, C# and Java.\n* Cinderella Visualizations [http://erkenntnis.icu.ac.jp/gcj/software/GAcindy-1.4/GAcindy.htm Hitzer] and [http://staff.science.uva.nl/~leo/cinderella/ Dorst].\n* Gaalop [http://www.gaalop.de/] Standalone GUI-Application that uses the Open-Source Computer Algebra Software Maxima to break down CLUViz code into C/C++ or Java code.\n* Gaalop Precompiler [http://www.gaalop.de/] Precompiler based on Gaalop integrated with CMake.\n* Gaalet, C++ Expression Template Library [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gaalet/ Seybold].\n* Versor [http://versor.mat.ucsb.edu/ Colapinto], A lightweight templated C++ Library with an OpenGL interface for efficient geometric algebra programming in arbitrary metrics, including conformal\n* Clifford Algebra with Mathematica [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2412 clifford.m]\n* Clifford Algebra with GiNaC [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0410044 built-in classes].
