  "textBody" : "Comparative law is the study of differences and similarities between the law of different countries.  More specifically, it involves study of the different legal \"systems\" (or \"families\") in existence in the world, including the common law, the civil law, socialist law, Canon law, Jewish Law, Islamic law, Hindu law, and Chinese law. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken.  The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalization and democratization.\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of modern comparative law can be traced back to 18th century Europe, although, prior to that, legal scholars had always practiced comparative methodologies.\n\nMontesquieu is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, De l'esprit des lois (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):\n\nAlso, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that \"to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.\" Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:\n\nThe modern founding figure of comparative and anthropological jurisprudence was Sir Henry Maine, a British jurist and legal historian. In his 1861 work Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas, he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of Eastern and Western legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.\n\nThe first university course on the subject was established at the University of Oxford in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.\n\nComparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, Rudolf Schlesinger.  Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at Cornell Law School helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.\n\nPurpose\n\nComparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig & Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship and how their elements combine into a system.\n\nSeveral disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative constitutional law, comparative administrative law, comparative civil law (in the sense of the law of torts, delicts, contracts and obligations), comparative commercial law (in the sense of business organisations and trade), and comparative criminal law. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:\n* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect\n* To perfect the legal systems in effect\n* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the UNIDROIT initiative)\n\nRelationship with other legal subjects\n\nComparative law is different from the fields of general jurisprudence (legal theory), international law, including both public international law and private international law (also known as conflict of laws).\n\nDespite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the United Nations System, in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of legal transplants, i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of legal transplants was coined by Alan Watson, one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.\n\nAlso, the usefulness of comparative law for sociology of law and law and economics (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law & economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: \n* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? \n* Are legal rules comparable? \n* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?\n\nClassifications of legal systems\n\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff\n\nArminjon, Nolde, and WolffTraité de droit comparé – in French; Paris 1950–1952 believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems per se get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the\n* French group, under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the Napoleonic code civil of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Louisiana, states of South America (such as Brazil), Quebec, Santa Lucia, the Ionian Islands, Egypt, and Lebanon\n* German group\n* Scandinavian group (comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland)\n* English group (incl. England, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand inter alia)\n* Russian group\n* Islamic group (used in the Muslim world)\n* Hindu group\n\nDavid\n\nRené DavidTraité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative - in French; Paris, 1950 proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:\n* Western Laws, a group subdivided into the:\n** Romano-Germanic subgroup (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law – see also Civil law (legal system))\n** Anglo-Saxon subgroup\n* Soviet Law\n* Muslim Law\n* Hindu Law\n* Chinese Law\n* Jewish Law\nEspecially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are\n* liberal democracy\n* capitalist economy\n* Christian religion\n\nZweigert and Kötz\n\nKonrad Zweigert and Hein Kötz propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: An Introduction to Comparative Law, translation from the German original: Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. .\n* Roman family\n* German family\n* Common law family\n* Nordic family\n* Family of the laws of the Far East (China, and Japan)\n* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)\n\nUp to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention Soviet or socialist law as another family of laws.Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996.
