The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production.

Diversification of the economy into non-mining industries remains a long-term issue. Mauritania is a net importer of food, reportedly importing 70% of its domestic food needs.IRIN 2008, [http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=77366 'MAURITANIA: Record hunger predicted in 2008'], www.irinnews.org, 19 March.

In 2004, Woodside had agreed to invest $US 600 million in developing Mauritania's Chinguetti offshore oil project.  The controversial amendments, which Mauritanian authorities declared had been signed \"outside the legal framework of normal practice, to the great detriment of our country\", could cost Mauritania up to $200 million a year, according to BBC News.  Signed by Woodside two weeks after the February 1, 2005 legislation authorizing the four amendments, they provided for a lower state quota in the profit-oil, and reduced taxes by 15 percent in certain zones.  They also eased environmental constraints, and extended the length and scope of the exploitation and exploration monopoly, among other measures.\n\nThe disputed amendments were signed by former oil minister Zeidane Ould Hmeida in February 2004 and March 2005.  Hmeida was arrested in January 2006 on charges of \"serious crimes against the country's essential economic interests\".\n\nNouakchott's authorities declared that the government would likely seek international arbitration, which Woodside (which operated for Hardman, BG Group, Premier Oil, ROC Oil, Fusion, Petronas, Dana Petroleum, Energy Africa and the Hydrocarbons Mauritanian Society) also contemplated.\n\nDiscovered in 2001, Chinguetti has proven reserves of about 120000000 oilbbl of oil.  At the end of December 2005, authorities estimated that in 2006, the oil profits would be 47 billion ouguiyas (about US$180 million) and represent a quarter of the state budget, according to RFI.\n\nSome U.S. oil companies are alleged to be playing a part in Mauritania's oil related corruption.",
