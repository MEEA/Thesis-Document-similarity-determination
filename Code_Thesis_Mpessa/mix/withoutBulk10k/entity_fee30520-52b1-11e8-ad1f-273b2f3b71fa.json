  "textBody" : "The demography of Germany is monitored by the Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office of Germany). According to the first census since reunification, Germany's population was counted to 82,175,700 (31 December 2015), making it the sixteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.5 in 2015 (the highest value since 1982) and in 2011 was even estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations. In 2008, fertility was related to educational achievement (with the less educated women having more children than higher educated ones).Statistisches Bundesamt. Mikrozensus 2008. Neue Daten zur Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland. p. 27ff In 2011, this was no longer true for Eastern Germany where higher educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.Bundesintitut für Bevölkerungsforschung 2012. Talsohle bei Akademikerinnen durchschritten? Kinderzahl und Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland nach Bildungs- und Berufsgruppen. Expertise für das Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend. p. 14 Persons who adhere to no religion have fewer children than Christians, and studies also found that among Christians the more conservative ones had more children than the more liberal ones.Michael Blume (2008) [http://www.wissenschaft-online.de/artikel/982875 Homo religiosus], Gehirn und Geist 04/2009. S. 32–41. In vitro fertilisation is legal in Germany, with an age limit set at 40.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States. More than 16,000,000 people are decended from immigrants (first and second generation, including mixed heritage and ethnic German repatriates and their descendants). 96.1% of those reside in western Germany and Berlin.Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: \"Die soziale Situation in Deutschland: Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I About 7,000,000 of them are foreign residents, which is defined as those not having German citizenship. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has been attracting immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) over time acquired German citizenship. While most of these immigrants arrived as guest workers, Germany has also been a prime destination for refugees who have applied for asylum in Germany, in part because the German constitution long had a clause guaranteeing political asylum as a human right, but restrictions over the years have since limited the scope.\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering universities has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita PPP income of about $41,370 in 2012,[http://www.weltbevoelkerung.de/oberes-menue/publikationen-downloads/zu-unseren-themen/laenderdatenbank/info-laender.html Länderdatenbank Deutschland]  Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. Whereas in 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls, By 2007, one child in 6 was on the welfare rolls, although these children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.\"Sozialhilfe: Kinderarmut nimmt zu\". Focus. 15.11.2007 Germans are typically very well-travelled people, with millions travelling overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s. This led the government to adopt a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market reforms known as Hartz I - IV.\n\nHistory\n\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany are also measured by a series of full censuses, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a micro census.\n\nStatistics since 1900\n\nPopulation statistics since 1900. Territorial changes of Germany occurred in 1918/1919, 1921/1922 and 1945/1946.\n\nFertility is not shown before 1950. Notable features before that time are fertility being extremely low during the ending years of the Weimar Republic, when it dropped down to about 1.6 child per woman in 1933.\n\nCurrent vital statistics\n\n*Births for January–June 2016 =  380,337\n*Births for January–June 2017 =  381,683\n\n*Deaths for January–June 2016 =  461,498\n*Deaths for January-June 2017 =  488,097\n\n*Population growth for January–June 2016 =  -81,121\n*Population growth for January–June 2017 =  -106,414\n\n1945–1990\n\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and also economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern New Länder to the western Old Länder for economic reasons.\n\nThe federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalisticHolger Wunderlich. Springer VS. Familienpolitik vor Ort - Strukturen, Akteure und Interaktionen auf kommunaler Ebene. p. 52 while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.\n\n1990–today\n\nAbout 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population, a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.\n\nAfter 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to the fact that there was a \"demographic shock\" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990 - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2015 the TFR of East Germany was 1.56, while TFR in the West – 1.50.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because of a scarcity of children.\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%. In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the Erziehungsgeld) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called \"Elterngeld\" was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes.Christoph Butterwegge, Michael Klundt, Matthias Zeng: Kinderarmut in Ost- und Westdeutschland. 2., erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, , p. 99–100 The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.§ 10 Abs. 5 BEEG, BGBl. I, S. 1885, 1896\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:Bujard, Martin (Hrsg.) (2013): Elterngeld und Elternzeit in Deutschland: Ziele, Diskurse und Wirkungen. Schwerpunktheft der Zeitschrift für Familienforschung, 25. Jg., Band 2,  Leverkusen: Verlag Barbara Budrich\n\n* The income of families having young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off their jobs (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to.\n* The birth rate of college educated women has risen.\n\nIn the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.Bundesintitut für Bevölkerungsforschung 2012. Talsohle bei Akademikerinnen durchschritten? Kinderzahl und Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland nach Bildungs- und Berufsgruppen. Expertise für das Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend. p. 15\n\nGeography\n\nWith an estimated more than 81.8 million inhabitants in late 2011, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the 16th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 229.4 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\nStates\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as Länder.The individual denomination is either Land [state], Freistaat [free state] or Freie (und) Hansestadt [free (and) Hanseatic city].  Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (Stadtstaaten) and states with larger territories (Flächenländer). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts (Kreise) on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts. \n\nCities\n\nMetropolitan regions\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nPopulation\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n;Population:\n82,175,700 (2015 estimate)\n\n;Age structure:\n* 0–14 years: 13.9% (male 5,894,724; female 5,590,373)\n* 15–64 years: 66.1% (male 27,811,357/female 26,790,222)\n* 65 years and over: 19.6% (male 6,771,972/female 9,542,348) (2015 est.)\n* 0–14 years: 13.7% (male 5,768,366/female 5,470,516)\n* 15–64 years: 66.1% (male 27,707,761/female 26,676,759)\n* 65 years and over: 20.3% (male 7,004,805/female 9,701,551) (2010 est.)\n\n;Sex ratio:\n* at birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n* under 15 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n* 15–64 years: 1.04 male(s)/female\n* 65 years and over: 0.72 male(s)/female\n* total population: 0.97 male(s)/female (2010 est.)\n\n;Infant mortality rate:\n4.09 deaths per 1,000 live births (2007)\n\ntotal: 3.99 deaths/1,000 live births (2010)\n\n;Life expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 81 years (2015)\n::::  80 (2013)\n;Total fertility rate:\n1.38 children born/woman (2008)\n\n1.42 children born/woman (2013)\n\n1.43 children born/woman (2014)\n\nWhile most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage, a growing number of children are born out-of-wedlock. In 2010 the out-of-wedlock-rate was 33%, more than twice of what it was in 1990.Handelsblatt (12 August 2011): \"Familienplanung: Uneheliche Babys im Vormarsch\" [https://www.handelsblatt.com/lifestyle/gesellschaft/uneheliche-babys-im-vormarsch/4493378.html]\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays, 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.Nicole Auferkorte-Michaelis, Sigrid Metz-Göckel, Jutta Wergen, Annette Klein. 2005: \"Junge Elternschaft und Wissenschaftskarriere - Wie kinderfreundlich sind Deutschlands Universitäten\". Hochschuldidaktisches Zentrum HDZ\n\nMigrant background and foreign nationality\n\nForeign nationals in Germany \n\n, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Germany were as follows:\n\nThis list does not include foreigners with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\nEthnic minorities and migrant background (Migrationshintergrund)\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005 – the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background – the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points. In 2015 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2016/09/PD16_327_122.html Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund auf Rekordniveau](number includes ethnic German repatriates)\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.\n\nFamilies with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.\n\nIn 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the Soviet Union (including a large number of Russian-speaking ethnic Germans), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of Yugoslavia and 1.5 million had Polish roots.Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: \"Die soziale Situation in Deutschland — Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I\"\n\nIn 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad. Median age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 33.8 years, while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 44.6 years.Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland: \"Leichter Anstieg der Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund\". Pressemitteilung Nr.105 vom 11.03.2008\n\nGermany is home to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide after the United States and Russia.[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2006Migration_Chart/Migration2006.pdf \"International Migration 2006\"] UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Retrieved 18 March 2011.\n\n, the population by background was as follows:\n\nFile:Simone Hauswald.JPG|Simone Hauswald has Migrationshintergrund due to one side of her parents being foreign-born\nFile:Mesut_%C3%96zil_(9881761465)_Cropped.jpg|Mesut Özil is classified as having a migrant background because both of his parents were born in Turkey\nFile:Helene_Fischer_Wiener_Stadthalle_Mai_2011.jpg|Helene Fischer has a migrant background despite being ethnically German because she was born in the Soviet Union to parents of the German minority in Russia.\n\nFour other sizable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" (nationale Minderheiten) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.  Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann Göring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles.  The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force.  With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival.  In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries.  Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from Kosovo. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these Heimatvertriebene in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321130252/http://www.iza.org/iza/en/papers/transatlantic/1_locher.pdf]\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991. Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage.\n\nIn 2000 there were also around 300,000–500,000 Afro-Germans (those who have German citizenship)Nina Zimnik: Nicht jeder Deutsche ist automatisch weiß Hamburger Abendblatt\" vom 15. August 2000 and 150,000+ African nationals. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minority are the Vietnamese people in Germany. About 40,000 Vietnamese live in Berlin and surroundings. Also there are about 20,000 to 25,000 Japanese people residing in Germany. Some South Asian and Southeast Asian immigration has taken place. Nearly 50,000 Indians live in Germany. As of 2008, there were 68,000 Filipino residents and an unknown number of Indonesians residing in Germany.[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/mar/12/yehey/top_stories/20080312top6.html] \n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called Gastarbeiter live in Germany. The Gastarbeiter mostly came from Chile, Greece, southern Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990. The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.Stephan Lanz: \"Berlin aufgemischt — abendländisch — multikulturell — kosmopolitisch? Die politische Konstruktion einer Einwanderungsstadt\". 2007. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag; p. 113 Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.Karin Weiss: \"Die Einbindung ehemaliger vietnamesischer Vertragsarbeiterinnen und Vertragsarbeiter in Strukturen der Selbstorganisation\", In: Almut Zwengel: \"Die \"Gastarbeiter der DDR — politischer Kontext und Lebenswelt\". Studien zur DDR Gesellschaft; p. 264 This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe most common male haplogroup among Germans is Haplogroup R1b, followed by Haplogroup I1, and Haplogroup R1a.\n\nImmigration\n\n \n\nIn its State of World Population 2006 report, the United Nations Population Fund lists Germany with hosting the third-highest percentage of the main international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 10 million of all 191 million migrants.United Nations Population Fund: [http://www.unfpa.org/publications/detail.cfm?ID294&filterListType\n State of World Population 2006]\nGermany had previously signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country.  During the 60s & 70s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\nCurrently, as of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.\n\nIn 2015 there were 476,649 asylum applications.\n\nEducation\n\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a Gesamtschule (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage. In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the Gymnasium enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years; the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education.\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the Gesamtschule. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule, while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.

Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\nMinority languages\n\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\nImplementation of the Charter is poor. The monitoring reports on charter implementation in Germany show many provisions unfulfilled. \n\nHigh German dialects\n\nGerman dialects – some quite distinct from the standard language – are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. . Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\nLow Saxon dialects\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\nForeign languages\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland. Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English. About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.",

    "aggregatedText" : "The demography of Germany is monitored by the Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office of Germany). According to the first census since reunification, Germany's population was counted to 82,175,700 (31 December 2015), making it the sixteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.5 in 2015 (the highest value since 1982) and in 2011 was even estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations. In 2008, fertility was related to educational achievement (with the less educated women having more children than higher educated ones).Statistisches Bundesamt. Mikrozensus 2008. Neue Daten zur Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland. p. 27ff In 2011, this was no longer true for Eastern Germany where higher educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.Bundesintitut für Bevölkerungsforschung 2012.

In vitro fertilisation is legal in Germany, with an age limit set at 40.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States. More than 16,000,000 people are decended from immigrants (first and second generation, including mixed heritage and ethnic German repatriates and their descendants). 96.1% of those reside in western Germany and Berlin.Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: \"Die soziale Situation in Deutschland: Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I About 7,000,000 of them are foreign residents, which is defined as those not having German citizenship. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has been attracting immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) over time acquired German citizenship. While most of these immigrants arrived as guest workers, Germany has also been a prime destination for refugees who have applied for asylum in Germany, in part because the German constitution long had a clause guaranteeing political asylum as a human right, but restrictions over the years have since limited the scope.\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering universities has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita PPP income of about $41,370 in 2012,[http://www.weltbevoelkerung.de/oberes-menue/publikationen-downloads/zu-unseren-themen/laenderdatenbank/info-laender.html Länderdatenbank Deutschland]  Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. Whereas in 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls, By 2007, one child in 6 was on the welfare rolls, although these children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.\"Sozialhilfe: Kinderarmut nimmt zu\". Focus. 15.11.2007 Germans are typically very well-travelled people, with millions travelling overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s. This led the government to adopt a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market reforms known as Hartz I - IV.\n\nHistory\n\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany are also measured by a series of full censuses, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a micro census.\n\nStatistics since 1900\n\nPopulation statistics since 1900. Territorial changes of Germany occurred in 1918/1919, 1921/1922 and 1945/1946.\n\nFertility is not shown before 1950. Notable features before that time are fertility being extremely low during the ending years of the Weimar Republic, when it dropped down to about 1.6 child per woman in 1933.\n\nCurrent vital statistics\n\n*Births for January–June 2016 =  380,337\n*Births for January–June 2017 =  381,683\n\n*Deaths for January–June 2016 =  461,498\n*Deaths for January-June 2017 =  488,097\n\n*Population growth for January–June 2016 =  -81,121\n*Population growth for January–June 2017 =  -106,414\n\n1945–1990\n\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and also economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern New Länder to the western Old Länder for economic reasons.\n\nThe federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalisticHolger Wunderlich. Springer VS. Familienpolitik vor Ort - Strukturen, Akteure und Interaktionen auf kommunaler Ebene. p. 52 while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.\n\n1990–today\n\nAbout 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population, a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.\n\nAfter 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to the fact that there was a \"demographic shock\" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990 - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2015 the TFR of East Germany was 1.56, while TFR in the West – 1.50.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because of a scarcity of children.\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%. In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the Erziehungsgeld) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called \"Elterngeld\" was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes.Christoph Butterwegge, Michael Klundt, Matthias Zeng: Kinderarmut in Ost- und Westdeutschland. 2., erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, , p. 99–100 The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.§ 10 Abs. 5 BEEG, BGBl.

Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off their jobs (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to.\n* The birth rate of college educated women has risen.\n\nIn the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.Bundesintitut für Bevölkerungsforschung 2012. Talsohle bei Akademikerinnen durchschritten? Kinderzahl und Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland nach Bildungs- und Berufsgruppen. Expertise für das Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend. p. 15\n\nGeography\n\nWith an estimated more than 81.8 million inhabitants in late 2011, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the 16th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 229.4 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\nStates\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as Länder.The individual denomination is either Land [state], Freistaat [free state] or Freie (und) Hansestadt [free (and) Hanseatic city].  Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (Stadtstaaten) and states with larger territories (Flächenländer). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts (Kreise) on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts. \n\nCities\n\nMetropolitan regions\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nPopulation\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n;Population:\n82,175,700 (2015 estimate)\n\n;Age structure:\n* 0–14 years: 13.9% (male 5,894,724; female 5,590,373)\n* 15–64 years: 66.1% (male 27,811,357/female 26,790,222)\n* 65 years and over: 19.6% (male 6,771,972/female 9,542,348) (2015 est.)\n* 0–14 years: 13.7% (male 5,768,366/female 5,470,516)\n* 15–64 years: 66.1% (male 27,707,761/female 26,676,759)\n* 65 years and over: 20.3% (male 7,004,805/female 9,701,551) (2010 est.)\n\n;Sex ratio:\n* at birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n* under 15 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n* 15–64 years: 1.04 male(s)/female\n* 65 years and over: 0.72 male(s)/female\n* total population: 0.97 male(s)/female (2010 est.)\n\n;Infant mortality rate:\n4.09 deaths per 1,000 live births (2007)\n\ntotal: 3.99 deaths/1,000 live births (2010)\n\n;Life expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 81 years (2015)\n::::  80 (2013)\n;Total fertility rate:\n1.38 children born/woman (2008)\n\n1.42 children born/woman (2013)\n\n1.43 children born/woman (2014)\n\nWhile most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage, a growing number of children are born out-of-wedlock. In 2010 the out-of-wedlock-rate was 33%, more than twice of what it was in 1990.Handelsblatt (12 August 2011): \"Familienplanung: Uneheliche Babys im Vormarsch\" [https://www.handelsblatt.com/lifestyle/gesellschaft/uneheliche-babys-im-vormarsch/4493378.html]\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays, 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.Nicole Auferkorte-Michaelis, Sigrid Metz-Göckel, Jutta Wergen, Annette Klein. 2005: \"Junge Elternschaft und Wissenschaftskarriere - Wie kinderfreundlich sind Deutschlands Universitäten\". Hochschuldidaktisches Zentrum HDZ\n\nMigrant background and foreign nationality\n\nForeign nationals in Germany \n\n, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Germany were as follows:\n\nThis list does not include foreigners with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\nEthnic minorities and migrant background (Migrationshintergrund)\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005 – the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background – the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points. In 2015 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2016/09/PD16_327_122.html Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund auf Rekordniveau](number includes ethnic German repatriates)\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.\n\nFamilies with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.\n\nIn 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the Soviet Union (including a large number of Russian-speaking ethnic Germans), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of Yugoslavia and 1.5 million had Polish roots.Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: \"Die soziale Situation in Deutschland — Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I\"\n\nIn 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad. Median age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 33.8 years, while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 44.6 years.Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland: \"Leichter Anstieg der Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund\".

Retrieved 18 March 2011.\n\n, the population by background was as follows:\n\nFile:Simone Hauswald.JPG|Simone Hauswald has Migrationshintergrund due to one side of her parents being foreign-born\nFile:Mesut_%C3%96zil_(9881761465)_Cropped.jpg|Mesut Özil is classified as having a migrant background because both of his parents were born in Turkey\nFile:Helene_Fischer_Wiener_Stadthalle_Mai_2011.jpg|Helene Fischer has a migrant background despite being ethnically German because she was born in the Soviet Union to parents of the German minority in Russia.\n\nFour other sizable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" (nationale Minderheiten) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.  Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann Göring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles.  The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force.  With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival.  In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries.  Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from Kosovo. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these Heimatvertriebene in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321130252/http://www.iza.org/iza/en/papers/transatlantic/1_locher.pdf]\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991. Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage.\n\nIn 2000 there were also around 300,000–500,000 Afro-Germans (those who have German citizenship)Nina Zimnik: Nicht jeder Deutsche ist automatisch weiß Hamburger Abendblatt\" vom 15. August 2000 and 150,000+ African nationals. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minority are the Vietnamese people in Germany. About 40,000 Vietnamese live in Berlin and surroundings. Also there are about 20,000 to 25,000 Japanese people residing in Germany. Some South Asian and Southeast Asian immigration has taken place. Nearly 50,000 Indians live in Germany. As of 2008, there were 68,000 Filipino residents and an unknown number of Indonesians residing in Germany.[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/mar/12/yehey/top_stories/20080312top6.html] \n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called Gastarbeiter live in Germany. The Gastarbeiter mostly came from Chile, Greece, southern Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990. The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.Stephan Lanz: \"Berlin aufgemischt — abendländisch — multikulturell — kosmopolitisch?

Bielefeld: transcript Verlag; p. 113 Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.Karin Weiss: \"Die Einbindung ehemaliger vietnamesischer Vertragsarbeiterinnen und Vertragsarbeiter in Strukturen der Selbstorganisation\", In: Almut Zwengel: \"Die \"Gastarbeiter der DDR — politischer Kontext und Lebenswelt\". Studien zur DDR Gesellschaft; p. 264 This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe most common male haplogroup among Germans is Haplogroup R1b, followed by Haplogroup I1, and Haplogroup R1a.\n\nImmigration\n\n \n\nIn its State of World Population 2006 report, the United Nations Population Fund lists Germany with hosting the third-highest percentage of the main international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 10 million of all 191 million migrants.United Nations Population Fund: [http://www.unfpa.org/publications/detail.cfm?ID294&filterListType\n State of World Population 2006]\nGermany had previously signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country.  During the 60s & 70s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\nCurrently, as of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.\n\nIn 2015 there were 476,649 asylum applications.\n\nEducation\n\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a Gesamtschule (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage. In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the Gymnasium enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years; the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education.\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the Gesamtschule. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule, while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200. Nearly all German universities are public institutions, charging tuition fees of €50–500 per semester for each student.\n\nPercentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany\n\nLiteracy\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in coorporation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.Teachers News: \"Funktionaler Analphabetismus\" Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\nHealth\n\n, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.\n, about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).\nThis article may incorporate text from this source, which is in the public domain.\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.\n\nReligion\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).Basic Law Art. 140\n\nAccording to a 1990s poll by Der Spiegel, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ. According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 57.9% of the country's population. The second largest religion is Islam, with between 2.1 and 4 million adherents (2.6% to 5%).[http://www.remid.de/remid_info_zahlen.htm REMID Data of \"Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst\"] retrieved 16 January 2015 Smaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents.

Other Christian churches and groups summed up to 3.3% with estimations for the Orthodox Church between 1.3% and 1.9%.\nSince the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 36.2% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population. Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200.000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000-60,000). All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 ( The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.

Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\nMinority languages\n\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\nImplementation of the Charter is poor. The monitoring reports on charter implementation in Germany show many provisions unfulfilled. \n\nHigh German dialects\n\nGerman dialects – some quite distinct from the standard language – are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. . Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\nLow Saxon dialects\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\nForeign languages\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland. Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English. About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.
