  "textBody" : "The Karađorđević (,  Karađorđevići / Карађорђевићи,) is a Serbian dynastic family, founded by Karađorđe Petrović, the Veliki Vožd (\"Grand Leader\") of Serbia in the early 1800s during the First Serbian Uprising. The relatively short-lived dynasty was supported by the Russian Empire and was opposed to the Austria-Hungary supported Obrenović dynasty. After Karađorđe's assassination in 1817, Miloš Obrenović founded the House of Obrenović. The two houses subsequently traded the throne for several generations. Following the assassination of Alexander in 1903, the Serbian Parliament chose Karađorđe's grandson, Peter Karađorđević, then living in exile, for the throne of the Kingdom of Serbia. He was duly crowned as King Peter I, and shortly before the end of World War I, representatives of the three peoples proclaimed a Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with Peter I as sovereign. In 1929, the Kingdom was renamed Yugoslavia, under Alexander I, the son of Peter I. In November 1945, the throne was lost when the League of Communists of Yugoslavia seized power, during the reign of Peter II.\n\nName\n\nIn English, it is typically spelled Karadjordjevic while pronunciation is roughly anglicized as Karageorgevitch, and was in previous times rendered also as Kara-Georgevitch.\n\nAncestry\n\nAccording to some researchers, Karađorđe's paternal ancestors most likely migrated from the Highlands (in what is today Montenegro) to Šumadija during the Second Great Serb Migration in 1737–39 under the leadership of Patriarch Šakabenta, as a result of the Austrian-Turkish War (in which Serbs took part). Serbian historiography accept the theory that Karađorđe's ancestors came from Vasojevići.\n\nSome conjecture has arisen about where the family ended up after arriving in Šumadija. According to Radoš Ljušić, Karađorđe's ancestors most likely hailed from Vasojevići, but he has said there is no certain historical information on Karađorđe's ancestors or where they came from, folklore being the only real source. Most likely, Karađorđe's ancestors hailed from Vasojevići.R-J. V. Vesović, 1935, \"Pleme Vasojevići\", Državna Štampa u Sarajevu, SarajevoFelix Phillip Kanitz 1987, p. 334: \"Као што је доказао Ђукић10, велики српски борац за слободу угледао је свој први дан живота 1752. у Вишевцу, окруженом густом храстовом шумом, где се његов отац доселио из Васојевића у Црној Гори.\" Grigorije Božović (1880–1945) claimed that the family were Srbljaci (natives) in Vasojevići territory.http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.rs/sr-l/1998/01/article-09.html Contributing to Srbljak theory is the fact that the family celebrated St Clement as their Slava until 1890, while the patron saint of Vasojevići, i.e. Vaso's descendants is Archangel Michael.
