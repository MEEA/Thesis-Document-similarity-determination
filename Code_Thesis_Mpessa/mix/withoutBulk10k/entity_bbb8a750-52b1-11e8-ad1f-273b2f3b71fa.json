  "textBody" : "The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain by 1 furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to  of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047 m2, or about 40% of a hectare.\n\nThe acre is commonly used in Antigua and Barbuda, American Samoa, the Bahamas, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Canada, Dominica, the Falkland Islands, Grenada, Ghana, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Ireland, Jamaica, Montserrat, Myanmar, Pakistan, Samoa, St. Lucia, St. Helena, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Turks and Caicos, the United Kingdom, the United States and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nThe international symbol of the acre is ac. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly  square metres.\n\nAn acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen.\n\nDescription\n\nOne acre equals 0.0015625 square miles, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feetNational Institute of Standards and Technology [http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf (n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement]  or about 4047 m2 (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660 ft, or 1 furlong) long and four perches (66 ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or 208 ft on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre.\n\nDifferences between international and US survey acres\n\nIn the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metres.National Bureau of Standards. (1959). [http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound]. Consequently, the international acre is exactly  square metres.\n\nBoth the international acre and the US survey acre contain  of a square mile or 4,840 square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about  square metres; its exact value ( m2) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37 inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.National Geodetic Survey, (January 1991), \"[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/Policy/st_plane.html Policy of the National Geodetic Survey Concerning Units of Measure for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983].\n\nSince the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016 square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8 square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.[http://www.acsm.net/_data/global/images/PDF%20Documents/ACSM/20110223ALTAACSMLandTitleSurveyStandard2011.pdf Minimum Standard Detail Requirements For ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys] .

[The standard uses \"precision\" in a sense more typically used for \"accuracy\"; the stated maximum allowable \"precision\" (page 3) is 2 cm and 50 parts per million. An instrument consistently measuring 2 cm short would measure the area of a one international acre square, 63.614907 m on a side, as 4044.3 square metres, 2.6 square metres less than the true value, a far greater discrepancy than the difference between the international and survey acres.]\n\nSouth Asia\n\nIn India, residential plots are measured in cents or decimal, which is one hundredth of an acre, or . In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common.\n\nEquivalence to other units of area\n\n1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:\n*0.40468564224 hectare (A square with 100 m sides has an area of 1 hectare.)\n*4,046.8564224 square metres\n\n1 United States survey acre is equal to:\n*0.404687261 hectare\n*4,046.87261 square metres  (1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres)\n\n1 acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:\n*66 feet × 660 feet (43,560 square feet)\n*10 square chains (1 chain 66 feet \n 22 yards 4 rods \n 100 links)\n*1 acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)\n*4,840 square yards\n*43,560 square feet\n*160 perches.

To be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the end zones). The full field, including the end zones, covers about .\n\nFor residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide association football (soccer) pitch.\n\nIt may also be remembered as 44,000 square feet, less 1%.\n\nHistorical origin \n\nThe word \"acre\" is derived from Old English  originally meaning \"open field\", cognate to west coast Norwegian  and Swedish , German , Dutch , Latin , Sanskrit , and Greek  (). In English, it was historically spelled aker.\n\nThe acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day. This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word \"furlong\" itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long.\n\nBefore the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of \"acre\" existed as there were German states.\n\nStatutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:\n*Edward I\n*Edward III\n*Henry VIII\n*George IV\n*Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.\n\nHistorically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.\n\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of  mile (880 yards) and is  square mile in area, or 160 acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being  mile long, and being  of a square mile in area, or 40 acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \"the back 40\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.\n\nLegacy acres\n\n* Customary acre – The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in carucates, virgates, bovates, nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.\n* Builder's acre – In US construction and real estate development, an area of 40,000 square feet. Used to simplify math and for marketing, it is nearly 10% smaller than a survey acre.\n* Scottish acre, one of a number of obsolete Scottish units of measurement\n* Irish acre = 7,840 square yards\n* Cheshire acre =  10,240 square yardsHolland, Robert.
