Jehoram was wounded and returned to Jezreel to recover. He was attended by Ahaziah, king of Judah, who was also his nephew. The writer of the Book of Kings tells that when the captains of the Israelite army were assembled away from the king's eyes, the prophet Elisha sent one of his students to the gathering. Elisha's student led Jehu away from the others, anointed him king in an inner chamber, and then departed (). Jehu's companions asked where he had been.

King Jehoram tried to flee, but Jehu fired an arrow which pierced his heart. King Ahaziah managed to escape, but was mortally wounded, and died shortly after in Megiddo.\n\nThe author of Kings tells that Jehu entered the city without resistance. He saw Jehoram's mother, Jezebel, watching him with contempt from a palace window. Jehu commanded the palace eunuchs to throw her from the window. Jezebel was killed, and Jehu drove his chariot over her body. Her servants later came to bury her, only to find that dogs had eaten all but her hands, feet, and skull.\n\nNow master of Jezreel, Jehu wrote to command the chief men in Samaria to hunt down and kill all of the royal princes. They did as ordered, and the next day he found seventy heads piled in two heaps outside the city gate.

He then slaughtered all of them at \"the pit of Beth-eked\", forty-two men in total.\n\nJehu's act was allegedly to honour the God of Israel since Jehoram's mother, Jezebel, had allowed pagan temples to exist in the kingdom. The biblical account frequently invokes the  \"avenging the blood of Naboth\" (,25,26), whose vineyard Ahab, Jehoram's father, had taken by force (). Jehoram's defeat at Ramoth-Gilead gave them an opportunity to throw off his burdensome rule.\n\nFollowing Jehu's slaughter of the Omrides, he met Jehonadab the Rechabite, who joined him in his chariot. They entered the capital together. This indicates that at least at the beginning of his reign, Jehu was supported by the pro-Jehovah faction. Once in control of Samaria, he summoned the worshippers of Baal and killed them (). He then destroyed their idols and their temple and turned it into a latrine.

He was hard pressed by Hazael, king of the Arameans, who defeated his armies \"throughout all of the territories of Israel\" beyond the Jordan river, in the lands of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh (f).\n\nThis suggests that Jehu offered tribute to Shalmaneser III, as depicted on his Black Obelisk, in order to gain a powerful ally against the Arameans.
