Bocce was initially played among the Italian migrants but has slowly become more popular with their descendants and the wider community.\n\nThe sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the Adriatic, especially in Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the sport is known in Serbo-Croatian as ' ('playing '') or ' (colloquially also ').[http://www.hrvatski-bocarski-savez.hr/ Croatian Bocce Association]Croatian Bocce Federation[http://www.bocanje-bih.com/ BiH Bocce Association] In Slovenia the sport is known as '[http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/ Bocce Association of Slovenia] or colloquially 'playing '', or ' (from Italian ' and Venetian ', meaning 'balls', respectively).[http://www.etno-muzej.si/en/spletne-zbirke/klasifikacije/igra-odraslih Slovene Ethnographic Museum]\n\nRules and play\n\nBocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts  in length and  wide.[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 4 - Specifications of the Court]  Bocce balls can be made of metal[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 1 - The Bowls] or various kinds of plastic. Unlike lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   \nA game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a ' ('little bocce') or ' ('bullet') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone 5 m in length, ending  from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.[https://books.google.com.mt/books?idWmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA309&dqrazzett&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#vonepage&q\nrazzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].\n\nThe side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does not have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch2.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 2 - Article 8 - Points to be Made and the Duration of the Match][https://books.google.com.mt/books?idWmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA309&dqrazzett&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#vonepage&q\nrazzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].\n\nPlayers are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position.
