  "textBody" : "Liverpool is Frankie Goes to Hollywood's second and last studio album, released in October 1986 (see 1986 in music). It would be the band's final album of all-new material, and lead singer Holly Johnson would leave the band following the corresponding world tour, followed by a flurry of lawsuits from ZTT. The album's production was handled by Trevor Horn's engineer Stephen Lipson, who urged the band to play their own instruments on this album (Horn having replaced the band's performances and arrangements with his session musicians or his own performances on Welcome to the Pleasuredome.) Liverpool therefore features a heavier rock sound than its predecessor. \n\nThe album was a commercial disappointment compared to the band's previous effort, though it charted generally high at #5 in the United Kingdom, #7 on the Austrian and Swiss music charts and #8 in Norway. The cover photo was different depending on what format was purchased (LP, cassette, or compact disc).\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs Gill/Johnson/Nash/O'Toole unless otherwise stated.\n\n# \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" - 4:58\n# \"Rage Hard\" - 5:03\n# \"Kill the Pain\" - 6:16\n# \"Maximum Joy\" - 5:32\n# \"Watching the Wildlife\" - 4:18\n# \"Lunar Bay\" - 5:42\n# \"For Heaven's Sake\" - 4:29\n# \"Is Anybody Out There?\" - 7:25\n\nA later release includes two bonus tracks:\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) of Your Mind\"\n# \"Suffragette City\" (David Bowie)\n\nSingles \n\n# \"Rage Hard\"\n# \"Warriors of the Wasteland\"\n# \"Watching the Wildlife\"\n\n2-CD Deluxe Edition \n\nIn 2011, a remastered Deluxe Edition of Liverpool was released, featuring a second disc containing rare and previously unreleased material.
