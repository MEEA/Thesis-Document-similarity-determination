  "textBody" : "The geography of Kenya is diverse. Kenya has a coastline on the Indian Ocean, which contains swamps of East African mangroves. Inland are broad plains and numerous hills.\n\nCentral and Western Kenya is characterised by the Kenyan Rift Valley home to Kenya's highest mountain, Mount Kenya and Mount Elgon on the border between Kenya and Uganda. The Kakamega Forest in western Kenya is relic of an East African rainforest. Much bigger is Mau Forest, the largest forest complex in East Africa.\n\nGeography \n\nLocation \n\n* Eastern Africa on the Indian Ocean coast between Somalia and Tanzania\n* Geographic coordinates: \n\nCentral Karachi, two kilometres from the Laalu Khet 4 Number\n\nArea \n\n* Total: 582650 km2\n* Land: 569140 km2\n* Water: 11227 km2\n\nLand boundaries \n\n* Total: 3457 km\n* Border countries: Ethiopia 867 km, Somalia 684 km, South Sudan 317 km, Tanzania 775 km, Uganda 814 km[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html cia.gov – The World Factbook Kenya]\n\nCoastline\n\n* 536 km (333 mi) along the Indian Ocean.\n\nMaritime claims\n\n* Territorial sea: 12 nmi\n* Exclusive economic zone: 200 nmi \n* Continental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nGeology\n\nMuch of the western two-thirds of the country consists of the Pliocene–Pleistocene volcanics deposited on Precambrian basement rocks.[http://www.epgeology.com/articles/kenya-rift-basin.html Petroleum Potential of NW-Kenya Rift Basins: A Synopsis of Evidence and Issues] The southeast corner of the country is underlain by sediments of the Karoo System of Permian to Late Triassic age and a strip of Jurassic age sediments along the coast in the Mombasa area. The Anza trough is a NW–SE trending Jurassic rift extending from the Indian Ocean coast to the Sudan northwest of Lake Turkana. The Anza Rift resulted from the break–up of Gondwana.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Kenya varies by location, from mostly cool every day, to always warm/hot. The climate along the coast is tropical. This means rainfall and temperatures are higher throughout the year. At the coastal cities, Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi, the air changes from cool to hot, almost every day. (See chart below).\n\nThe further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about 12 °C (corresponding to a rise of about 22 °F), almost every day.\n\nElevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11 °C (20 °F) cooler, day or night.\n  \"NairobiDagoretti, Kenya: Climate, Global Warming, and\n  Daylight Charts and Data\", Climate-Charts.com, 2008, web:\n  [http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/k/KN63741.php CC741]:\n  compare Nairobi/Dagoretti data with \n\n  or Mombasa charts.\n\n  \"Kitale, Kenya: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight\n  Charts and Data\", Climate-Charts.com, 2008, web:\n  [http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/k/KN63661.php CC661].\n The many cities over a kilometre in elevation have temperature swings from roughly 50 -. Nairobi, at 1798 m, ranges from 49 -, and Kitale, at 1825 m, ranges from 51 -. At night, heavy clothes or blankets are needed, in the highlands, when the temperature drops to about 50 - every night.\n\nAt lower altitudes, the increased temperature is like day and night, literally: like starting the morning at the highland daytime high, and then adding the heat of the day, again. Hence, the overnight low temperatures near sea level are nearly the same as the high temperatures of the elevated Kenyan highlands. However, locations along the Indian Ocean have more moderate temperatures, as a few degrees cooler in the daytime, such as at Mombasa (see chart below).\n\nThere are slight seasonal variations in temperature, of 4 C-change, cooler in the winter months. Although Kenya is centred at the equator, it shares the seasons of the southern hemisphere: with the warmest summer months in December–March and the coolest winter months in June–August, again with differences in temperature varying by location within the country.\n\nOn the high mountains, such as Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon and Kilimanjaro, the weather can become bitterly cold for most of the year. Some snowfall does occur on the highest mountains.\n\nTerrain\n\nKenya's terrain is composed of low plains that rise into central highlands that are, in turn, bisected by the Great Rift Valley. There is also a fertile plateau in the west of the country.\n\nElevation extremes\n\nThe lowest point on Kenya is at sea level on the Indian Ocean. The highest point on Kenya is 5,197 meters above sea level at Mount Kenya.\n\nRivers\n\nThe three main rivers are the Galana and the Tana and The Nzoia River which is a 257 km Kenyan river, rising from Mount Elgon. It flows south and then west, eventually flowing into Lake Victoria near the town of Port Victoria. However, the Ewaso Ng'iro is an important river, supplying water from Mt. Kenya to the eastern and north-eastern part of Kenya.\n\nNatural resources\n\nNatural resources that are found in Kenya include: limestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, oil, gas, gypsum, wildlife and hydropower.\n\nLand use\n\n9.8% of the land is arable; permanent crops occupy 0.9% of the land, permanent pasture occupy 37.4% of the land; forest occupies 6.1% of the land. Other uses make up the rest of Kenya's land. This is as of 2011.\n\n1032 km² of Kenyan land was irrigated in 2003.\n\nTotal renewable water resources\n\n30.7 km3 (2011)\n\nFreshwater withdrawal\n\n* Total: 2.74 km3/yr (17%/4%/79%)\n* Per capita: 72.96 m3/yr (2003)\n\nNatural hazards\n\nNatural hazards include recurring drought and flooding during the rainy seasons.\n\nThere is limited volcanic activity in the country. Barrier Volcano (elev. 1,032 m) last erupted in 1921. Several others have been historically active (see List of volcanoes in Kenya).\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nCurrent issues\n\nCurrent issues that threaten the environment at the moment include water pollution from urban and industrial wastes; degradation of water quality from the increased use of pesticides and fertilisers; deforestation; water hyacinth infestation in Lake Victoria; soil erosion; desertification; and poaching.\n\nInternational agreements\n\n* Party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Wetlands, Whaling.\n\nExtreme points \n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Kenya, the points that are further north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point – Kalukwakerith Mountain, Turkana County\n* Easternmost point – the tripoint with Ethiopia and Somalia, Mandera County\n* Southernmost point – the point where the border with Tanzania enters the Indian Ocean, Kwale County\n* Westernmost point – unnamed land west of Port Victoria, Busia County\n** Note: Kalukwakerith Mountain is in the disputed Ilemi Triangle region.
