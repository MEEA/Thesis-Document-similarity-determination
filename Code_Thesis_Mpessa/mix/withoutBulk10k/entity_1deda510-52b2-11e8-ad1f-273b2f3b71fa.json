  "textBody" : "Jerzy Kosiński (; June 14, 1933 – May 3, 1991), born Józef Lewinkopf, was a Polish-American novelist and two-time President of the American Chapter of P.E.N., who wrote primarily in English. Born in Poland, he survived World War II and, as a young man, immigrated to the U.S., where he became a citizen.\n\nHe was known for various novels, among them The Painted Bird (1965) and Being There (1970), which was adapted as a film (1979).\n\nEarly life, teaching, and marriage \n\nKosiński was born Józef Lewinkopf to Jewish parents in Łódź, Poland.  As a child during World War II, he lived in central Poland under a false identity, Jerzy Kosiński, which his father gave to him. A Roman Catholic priest issued him a forged baptismal certificate, and the Lewinkopf family survived the Holocaust thanks to local villagers who offered assistance to Polish Jews, often at great risk. (The penalty for helping Jews in Nazi- Germany-occupied Poland was death for all members of a family and sometimes for the inhabitants of the village). Kosiński's father was assisted not only by town leaders and clergymen, but also by individuals such as Marianna Pasiowa, a member of an underground network that helped Jews evade capture. The family lived openly in Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, near Stalowa Wola, and attended church in nearby Wola Rzeczycka, with the support of villagers in Kępa Rzeczycka. For a time, they were sheltered by a Catholic family in Rzeczyca Okrągła. Jerzy even served as an altar boy in the local church.James Park Sloan. Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography (New York: Dutton/Penguin, 1996), pp.7–54.\n\nAfter the war ended, Kosiński and his parents moved to Jelenia Góra. By age 22 he had earned two graduate degrees, in history and sociology, at the University of Łódź. He then became an associate professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences. Kosinski also studied in the Soviet Union, and served as a sharpshooter in the Polish Army.\n\nIn order to immigrate to the United States in 1957, he created a fake foundation, which supposedly sponsored him. He later claimed he forged the letters from prominent communist authorities guaranteeing his loyal return to Poland, as were then required for anyone leaving the country.\n\nKosiński first worked at odd jobs to get by, including driving a truck, and he managed to graduate from Columbia University. He became an American citizen in 1965. He also received grants from the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 and the Ford Foundation in 1968. In 1970, he won the American Academy of Arts and Letters award for literature. The grants allowed him to write a political non-fiction book that opened new doors of opportunity. He became a lecturer at Yale, Princeton, Davenport, and Wesleyan Universities.\n\nIn 1962, Kosiński married an American steel heiress, Mary Hayward Weir. They divorced four years later. Weir died in 1968 from brain cancer, leaving Kosiński out of her will. He would fictionalize his marriage in his novel Blind Date, speaking of Weir under pseudonym Mary-Jane Kirkland. Kosiński later in 1968 married Katherina \"Kiki\" von Fraunhofer (1933 — 2007), a marketing consultant and a member of the Bavarian nobility.\n\nDeath \n\nKosiński suffered from multiple illnesses towards the end of his life, and he was under attack from journalists who accused him of plagiarism. By his late 50s, he was suffering from an irregular heartbeat, as well as severe physical and nervous exhaustion.\n\nHe committed suicide on May 3, 1991, by ingesting a lethal amount of alcohol and drugs[http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/barbiturates Los Angeles Times] and wrapping a plastic bag around his head, suffocating to death.Taylor, John. \"[https://books.google.com/books?idVukCAAAAMBAJ&lpg\nPP1&pgPA24#v\nonepage&q&ffalse The Haunted Bird: The Death and Life of Jerzy Kosinski]\", New York Magazine, June 15, 1991.

They recognized names of Jewish children sheltered by them (who also survived the war), depicted in the novel as victims of abuse by characters based on them.

(See 'Criticism' section, below.)\n\nSteps \n\nSteps (1968), a novel comprising scores of loosely connected vignettes, won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.\n\nAmerican novelist David Foster Wallace described Steps as a \"collection of unbelievably creepy little allegorical tableaux done in a terse elegant voice that's like nothing else anywhere ever\". Wallace continued in praise: \"Only Kafka's fragments get anywhere close to where Kosiński goes in this book, which is better than everything else he ever did combined.\" Samuel Coale, in a 1974 discussion of Kosiński's fiction, wrote that \"the narrator of  Steps for instance, seems to be nothing more than a disembodied voice howling in some surrealistic wilderness.\"Samuel Coale. The Quest for the Elusive Self: the Fiction of Jerzy Kosiński. Critique: Studies in Modern Fiction. 14, (3), pp. 25–37. Quoted in: Harold Bloom.

Chelsea House Publishers, 1985. , \n\nBeing There \n\nOne of Kosiński's most significant works is Being There (1970), a satirical view of the absurd reality of America's media culture. It is the story of Chance the gardener, a man with few distinctive qualities who emerges from nowhere and suddenly becomes the heir to the throne of a Wall Street tycoon and a presidential policy adviser. His simple and straightforward responses to popular concerns are praised as visionary despite the fact that no one actually understands what he is really saying. Many questions surround his mysterious origins, and filling in the blanks in his background proves impossible.\n\nThe novel was made into a 1979 movie directed by Hal Ashby, and starring Peter Sellers, who was nominated for an Academy Award for the role, and Melvyn Douglas, who won the award for Best Supporting Actor.  The screenplay was co-authored by award-winning screenwriter Robert C. Jones with Kosiński. The film won the 1981 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Film) Best Screenplay Award, as well as the 1980 Writers Guild of America Award (Screen) for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.  It was also nominated for the 1980 Golden Globe Best Screenplay Award (Motion Picture).\n\nCriticism \n\nAccording to Eliot Weinberger, an American writer, essayist, editor and translator, Kosiński was not the author of The Painted Bird. Weinberger alleged in his 2000 book Karmic Traces that Kosiński was not fluent in English at the time of its writing.Eliot Weinberger Genuine Fakes in his collection Karmic Traces; New Directions, 2000, \n\nIn a review of Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography by James Park Sloan, D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&M University wrote \"For years Kosinski passed off The Painted Bird as the true story of his own experience during the Holocaust.  Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at Houghton Mifflin, to whom Kosinski confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences. Upon accepting the book for publication Santillana said, \"It is my understanding that, fictional as the material may sound, it is straight autobiography.\" Although he backed away from this claim, Kosinski never wholly disavowed it.[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan]\n\nM. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion: \"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake – possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want.  (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them – as is the case with Kosinski.)  Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a pseudonym, and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right.\"\n[http://www.complete-review.com/quarterly/vol2/issue1/ffakes.htm \"Facts and Fakes\" by M.A.Orthofer]\n\nKosiński himself addressed these claims in the introduction to the 1976 reissue of The Painted Bird, saying that \"Well-intentioned writers, critics, and readers sought facts to back up their claims that the novel was autobiographical. They wanted to cast me in the role of spokesman for my generation, especially for those who had survived the war; but for me survival was an individual action that earned the survivor the right to speak only for himself. Facts about my life and my origins, I felt, should not be used to test the book's authenticity, any more than they should be used to encourage readers to read The Painted Bird. Furthermore, I felt then, as I do now, that fiction and autobiography are very different modes.\"\n\nPlagiarism allegations \n\nIn June 1982, a Village Voice report by Geoffrey Stokes and Eliot Fremont-Smith accused Kosiński of plagiarism, claiming that much of his work was derivative of prewar books unfamiliar to English readers, and that Being There was a plagiarism of Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy — The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma — a 1932 Polish bestseller by Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz.  They also alleged Kosiński wrote The Painted Bird in Polish, and had it secretly translated into English.  The report claimed that Kosiński's books had actually been ghost-written by \"assistant editors\", finding stylistic differences among Kosiński's novels.  Kosiński, according to them, had depended upon his free-lance editors for \"the sort of composition that we usually call writing.\" American biographer James Sloan notes that New York poet, publisher and translator, George Reavey, claimed to have written The Painted Bird for Kosiński.George Reavey [http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan]\n\nThe article found a more realistic picture of Kosiński's life during the Holocaust — a view which was supported by biographers Joanna Siedlecka and Sloan.  The article asserted that The Painted Bird, assumed to be semi-autobiographical, was largely a work of fiction.  The information showed that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, as his fictional character did, Kosiński spent the war years in hiding with Polish Catholics.\n\nTerence Blacker, a profitable English publisher (who helped publish Kosiński's books) and author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote an article published in The Independent in 2002:\nThe significant point about Jerzy Kosiński was that... his books... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty's Reds.  He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.  All in all, he was a perfect candidate for the snarling pack of literary hangers-on to turn on.  There is something about a storyteller becoming rich and having a reasonably full private life that has a powerful potential to irritate so that, when things go wrong, it causes a very special kind of joy.\n[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020617/ai_n12627315 \"Plagiarism? Let's just call it postmodernism\" by Terence Blacker] \n\nD. G. Myers responded to Blacker's assertions in his review of Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan:\nThis theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. 'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosinski that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosinski emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against... all-out psychosis.\n\nJournalist John Corry wrote a 6,000-word feature article in The New York Times in November 1982, responding and defending Kosiński, which appeared on the front page of the Arts and Leisure section.  Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that \"Kosinski was a plagiarist in the pay of the C.I.A. were the product of a Polish Communist disinformation campaign.\"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res\nF30C1FFC3D5D0C748CDDA80994DA484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCorry%2c%20John select.nytimes.com]\n\nKosiński himself responded that he had never maintained that the book was autobiographical, even though years earlier he confided to Houghton Mifflin editor Santillana that his manuscript \"draws upon a childhood spent, by the casual chances of war, in the remotest villages of Eastern Europe.\" In 1988, he wrote The Hermit of 69th Street, in which he sought to demonstrate the absurdity of investigating prior work by inserting footnotes for practically every term in the book.[http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/lk01033t.htm#2 New York Theatre Wire: \"More Lies About Jerzy\" by Lucy Komisar] \"Ironically,\" wrote theatre critic Lucy Komisar, \"possibly his only true book ... about a successful author who is shown to be a fraud.\"\n\nDespite repudiation of the Village Voice allegations in detailed articles in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and other publications, Kosiński remained tainted. \"I think it contributed to his death,\" said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a friend and fellow Polish emigrant.\n\nTelevision, radio, film, and newspaper appearances\n\nKosiński appeared 12 times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson during 1971–73, and The Dick Cavett Show in 1974, was a guest on the talk radio show of Long John Nebel, posed half-naked for a cover photograph by Annie Leibovitz for The New York Times Magazine in 1982, and presented the Oscar for screenwriting in 1982.\n\nHe also played the role of Bolshevik revolutionary and Politburo member Grigory Zinoviev in Warren Beatty's film Reds.  The Time magazine critic wrote:  \"As Reed's Soviet nemesis, novelist Jerzy Kosinski acquits himself nicely–a tundra of ice against Reed's all-American fire.\"  Newsweek complimented Kosinski's \"delightfully abrasive\" performance.\n\nFriendships \n\nKosiński was friends with Roman Polanski, with whom he attended the National Film School in Łódź, and said he narrowly missed being at Polanski and Sharon Tate's house on the night Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's followers in 1969, due to lost luggage.  His novel Blind Date discussed the Manson murders.\n\nIn 1984, Polanski denied Kosiński's story in his autobiography. Journalist John Taylor of New York Magazine believes Polanski was mistaken. \"Although it was a single sentence in a 461-page book, reviewers focused on it. But the accusation was untrue: Jerzy and Kiki had been invited to stay with Tate the night of the Manson murders, and they missed being killed as well only because they stopped in New York en route from Paris because their luggage had been misdirected.\" The reason why Taylor believes this is that \"a friend of Kosiński's wrote a letter to the Times, which was published in the Book Review, describing the detailed plans he and Jerzy had made to meet that weekend at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive. Few people saw the letter.\" The NYM article does not contain the name of this friend, nor the particular issue of the Book Review in which this letter is supposed to have been published, nor names of the 'few' who may have read the letter.\n\nKosiński was also friends with Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger. He introduced the couple.\n\nSvetlana Alliluyeva, who had a friendship with Kosinski, is introduced as a character in his novel “Blind Date”.\n\nKosiński wrote his novel Pinball (1982) for his friend George Harrison, having conceived of the idea for the book at least ten years before writing it.Kosiński, Jerzy (1992) Passing By: Selected Essays, 1962–1991 Grove Press, p.54 \n\nInterests \n\nKosiński practiced the photographic arts, with one-man exhibitions to his credit in Warsaw's Crooked Circle Gallery (1957), and in the Andre Zarre Gallery in New York (1988). He watched surgeries, and read to terminally ill patients.\n\nKosiński was also very interested in polo, and compared himself to a character from his novel Passion Play: \"The character, Fabian, is at the mercy of his aging and his sexual obsession. It's my calling card. I'm 46. I'm like Fabian.\"\n\nBibliography \n\n*The Future Is Ours, Comrade: Conversations with the Russians (1960), published under the pseudonym \"Joseph Novak\"\n*No Third Path (1962), published under the pseudonym \"Joseph Novak\"\n*The Painted Bird (1965)\n*The Art of the Self: Essays à propos Steps (1968)\n*Steps (1968)\n*Being There (1970)\n*By Jerzy Kosinski: Packaged Passion.

(See 'Criticism' section, below.)\n\nSteps \n\nSteps (1968), a novel comprising scores of loosely connected vignettes, won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.\n\nAmerican novelist David Foster Wallace described Steps as a \"collection of unbelievably creepy little allegorical tableaux done in a terse elegant voice that's like nothing else anywhere ever\". Wallace continued in praise: \"Only Kafka's fragments get anywhere close to where Kosiński goes in this book, which is better than everything else he ever did combined.\" Samuel Coale, in a 1974 discussion of Kosiński's fiction, wrote that \"the narrator of  Steps for instance, seems to be nothing more than a disembodied voice howling in some surrealistic wilderness.\"Samuel Coale. The Quest for the Elusive Self: the Fiction of Jerzy Kosiński. Critique: Studies in Modern Fiction. 14, (3), pp. 25–37. Quoted in: Harold Bloom.

Chelsea House Publishers, 1985. , \n\nBeing There \n\nOne of Kosiński's most significant works is Being There (1970), a satirical view of the absurd reality of America's media culture. It is the story of Chance the gardener, a man with few distinctive qualities who emerges from nowhere and suddenly becomes the heir to the throne of a Wall Street tycoon and a presidential policy adviser. His simple and straightforward responses to popular concerns are praised as visionary despite the fact that no one actually understands what he is really saying. Many questions surround his mysterious origins, and filling in the blanks in his background proves impossible.\n\nThe novel was made into a 1979 movie directed by Hal Ashby, and starring Peter Sellers, who was nominated for an Academy Award for the role, and Melvyn Douglas, who won the award for Best Supporting Actor.  The screenplay was co-authored by award-winning screenwriter Robert C. Jones with Kosiński. The film won the 1981 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Film) Best Screenplay Award, as well as the 1980 Writers Guild of America Award (Screen) for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.  It was also nominated for the 1980 Golden Globe Best Screenplay Award (Motion Picture).\n\nCriticism \n\nAccording to Eliot Weinberger, an American writer, essayist, editor and translator, Kosiński was not the author of The Painted Bird. Weinberger alleged in his 2000 book Karmic Traces that Kosiński was not fluent in English at the time of its writing.Eliot Weinberger Genuine Fakes in his collection Karmic Traces; New Directions, 2000, \n\nIn a review of Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography by James Park Sloan, D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&M University wrote \"For years Kosinski passed off The Painted Bird as the true story of his own experience during the Holocaust.  Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at Houghton Mifflin, to whom Kosinski confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences. Upon accepting the book for publication Santillana said, \"It is my understanding that, fictional as the material may sound, it is straight autobiography.\" Although he backed away from this claim, Kosinski never wholly disavowed it.[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan]\n\nM. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion: \"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake – possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want.  (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them – as is the case with Kosinski.)  Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a pseudonym, and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right.\"\n[http://www.complete-review.com/quarterly/vol2/issue1/ffakes.htm \"Facts and Fakes\" by M.A.Orthofer]\n\nKosiński himself addressed these claims in the introduction to the 1976 reissue of The Painted Bird, saying that \"Well-intentioned writers, critics, and readers sought facts to back up their claims that the novel was autobiographical. They wanted to cast me in the role of spokesman for my generation, especially for those who had survived the war; but for me survival was an individual action that earned the survivor the right to speak only for himself. Facts about my life and my origins, I felt, should not be used to test the book's authenticity, any more than they should be used to encourage readers to read The Painted Bird. Furthermore, I felt then, as I do now, that fiction and autobiography are very different modes.\"\n\nPlagiarism allegations \n\nIn June 1982, a Village Voice report by Geoffrey Stokes and Eliot Fremont-Smith accused Kosiński of plagiarism, claiming that much of his work was derivative of prewar books unfamiliar to English readers, and that Being There was a plagiarism of Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy — The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma — a 1932 Polish bestseller by Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz.  They also alleged Kosiński wrote The Painted Bird in Polish, and had it secretly translated into English.  The report claimed that Kosiński's books had actually been ghost-written by \"assistant editors\", finding stylistic differences among Kosiński's novels.  Kosiński, according to them, had depended upon his free-lance editors for \"the sort of composition that we usually call writing.\" American biographer James Sloan notes that New York poet, publisher and translator, George Reavey, claimed to have written The Painted Bird for Kosiński.George Reavey [http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan]\n\nThe article found a more realistic picture of Kosiński's life during the Holocaust — a view which was supported by biographers Joanna Siedlecka and Sloan.  The article asserted that The Painted Bird, assumed to be semi-autobiographical, was largely a work of fiction.  The information showed that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, as his fictional character did, Kosiński spent the war years in hiding with Polish Catholics.\n\nTerence Blacker, a profitable English publisher (who helped publish Kosiński's books) and author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote an article published in The Independent in 2002:\nThe significant point about Jerzy Kosiński was that... his books... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty's Reds.  He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.  All in all, he was a perfect candidate for the snarling pack of literary hangers-on to turn on.  There is something about a storyteller becoming rich and having a reasonably full private life that has a powerful potential to irritate so that, when things go wrong, it causes a very special kind of joy.\n[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020617/ai_n12627315 \"Plagiarism? Let's just call it postmodernism\" by Terence Blacker] \n\nD. G. Myers responded to Blacker's assertions in his review of Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Park Sloan:\nThis theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. 'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosinski that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosinski emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against... all-out psychosis.\n\nJournalist John Corry wrote a 6,000-word feature article in The New York Times in November 1982, responding and defending Kosiński, which appeared on the front page of the Arts and Leisure section.  Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that \"Kosinski was a plagiarist in the pay of the C.I.A. were the product of a Polish Communist disinformation campaign.\"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res\nF30C1FFC3D5D0C748CDDA80994DA484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCorry%2c%20John select.nytimes.com]\n\nKosiński himself responded that he had never maintained that the book was autobiographical, even though years earlier he confided to Houghton Mifflin editor Santillana that his manuscript \"draws upon a childhood spent, by the casual chances of war, in the remotest villages of Eastern Europe.\" In 1988, he wrote The Hermit of 69th Street, in which he sought to demonstrate the absurdity of investigating prior work by inserting footnotes for practically every term in the book.[http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/lk01033t.htm#2 New York Theatre Wire: \"More Lies About Jerzy\" by Lucy Komisar] \"Ironically,\" wrote theatre critic Lucy Komisar, \"possibly his only true book ... about a successful author who is shown to be a fraud.\"\n\nDespite repudiation of the Village Voice allegations in detailed articles in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and other publications, Kosiński remained tainted. \"I think it contributed to his death,\" said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a friend and fellow Polish emigrant.\n\nTelevision, radio, film, and newspaper appearances\n\nKosiński appeared 12 times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson during 1971–73, and The Dick Cavett Show in 1974, was a guest on the talk radio show of Long John Nebel, posed half-naked for a cover photograph by Annie Leibovitz for The New York Times Magazine in 1982, and presented the Oscar for screenwriting in 1982.\n\nHe also played the role of Bolshevik revolutionary and Politburo member Grigory Zinoviev in Warren Beatty's film Reds.  The Time magazine critic wrote:  \"As Reed's Soviet nemesis, novelist Jerzy Kosinski acquits himself nicely–a tundra of ice against Reed's all-American fire.\"  Newsweek complimented Kosinski's \"delightfully abrasive\" performance.\n\nFriendships \n\nKosiński was friends with Roman Polanski, with whom he attended the National Film School in Łódź, and said he narrowly missed being at Polanski and Sharon Tate's house on the night Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's followers in 1969, due to lost luggage.  His novel Blind Date discussed the Manson murders.\n\nIn 1984, Polanski denied Kosiński's story in his autobiography. Journalist John Taylor of New York Magazine believes Polanski was mistaken. \"Although it was a single sentence in a 461-page book, reviewers focused on it. But the accusation was untrue: Jerzy and Kiki had been invited to stay with Tate the night of the Manson murders, and they missed being killed as well only because they stopped in New York en route from Paris because their luggage had been misdirected.\" The reason why Taylor believes this is that \"a friend of Kosiński's wrote a letter to the Times, which was published in the Book Review, describing the detailed plans he and Jerzy had made to meet that weekend at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive. Few people saw the letter.\" The NYM article does not contain the name of this friend, nor the particular issue of the Book Review in which this letter is supposed to have been published, nor names of the 'few' who may have read the letter.\n\nKosiński was also friends with Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger. He introduced the couple.\n\nSvetlana Alliluyeva, who had a friendship with Kosinski, is introduced as a character in his novel “Blind Date”.\n\nKosiński wrote his novel Pinball (1982) for his friend George Harrison, having conceived of the idea for the book at least ten years before writing it.Kosiński, Jerzy (1992) Passing By: Selected Essays, 1962–1991 Grove Press, p.54 \n\nInterests \n\nKosiński practiced the photographic arts, with one-man exhibitions to his credit in Warsaw's Crooked Circle Gallery (1957), and in the Andre Zarre Gallery in New York (1988). He watched surgeries, and read to terminally ill patients.\n\nKosiński was also very interested in polo, and compared himself to a character from his novel Passion Play: \"The character, Fabian, is at the mercy of his aging and his sexual obsession. It's my calling card. I'm 46. I'm like Fabian.\"\n\nBibliography \n\n*The Future Is Ours, Comrade: Conversations with the Russians (1960), published under the pseudonym \"Joseph Novak\"\n*No Third Path (1962), published under the pseudonym \"Joseph Novak\"\n*The Painted Bird (1965)\n*The Art of the Self: Essays à propos Steps (1968)\n*Steps (1968)\n*Being There (1970)\n*By Jerzy Kosinski: Packaged Passion.
