  "textBody" : "Elementary algebra encompasses some of the basic concepts of algebra, one of the main branches of mathematics. It is typically taught to secondary school students and builds on their understanding of arithmetic. Whereas arithmetic deals with specified numbers,H.E. Slaught and N.J. Lennes, Elementary algebra, Publ. Allyn and Bacon, 1915, [https://books.google.com/books?idgLii_eO4dNsC&lpg\nPA1&dq%22Elementary%20algebra%22%20letters&pg\nPA1#vonepage&q&f\nfalse page 1] (republished by Forgotten Books) algebra introduces quantities without fixed values, known as variables.Lewis Hirsch, Arthur Goodman, Understanding Elementary Algebra With Geometry: A Course for College Students, Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2005, , 9780534999728, 654 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id7hdK4RSub5cC&lpg\nPA2&dqwhat%20is%20algebra%20for&pg\nPA2#vonepage&q\ngeneralization&f=false page 2] This use of variables entails a use of algebraic notation and an understanding of the general rules of the operators introduced in arithmetic.  Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers.\n\nThe use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic equations.\n\nAlgebraic notation \n\nAlgebraic notation describes how algebra is written. It follows certain rules and conventions, and has its own terminology. For example, the expression 3x^2 - 2xy + c has the following components:\n\n1 : Exponent (power), 2 : Coefficient, 3 : term, 4 : operator, 5 : constant, x, y : variables\n\nA coefficient is a numerical value, or letter representing a numerical constant, that multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A term is an addend or a summand, a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, Introductory Algebra: An Applied Approach, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2010, , 9781439046043, [https://books.google.com/books?idMPIWikTHVXQC&lpg\nPP1&otsyG1m9DkIiH&dq\ncoefficient%20algebra&pgPA78#v\nonepage&qcoefficient%20&f\nfalse page 78] Letters represent variables and constants. By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. a, b, c) are typically used to represent constants, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. x, y and z) are used to represent variables.William L. Hosch (editor), The Britannica Guide to Algebra and Trigonometry, Britannica Educational Publishing, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, , 9781615302192, [https://books.google.com/books?idad0P0elU1_0C&lpg\nPA71&dqelementary%20algebra%20letters%20alphabet%20constants%20variables&pg\nPA71#vonepage&q\nletters&f=false page 71] They are usually written in italics.James E.

This is useful for several reasons.\n\n#Variables may represent numbers whose values are not yet known. For example, if the temperature of the current day, C, is 20 degrees higher than the temperature of the previous day, P,  then the problem can be described algebraically as C P + 20.Lewis Hirsch, Arthur Goodman, Understanding Elementary Algebra With Geometry: A Course for College Students, Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2005, , 9780534999728, 654 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\njsT7kqZubvIC&lpgPA48&ots\nEI4_yaKasG&dq%22elementary%20algebra%22%20variables%20unknown&pg\nPA48#vonepage&q\n%22elementary%20algebra%22%20variables%20unknown&f=false page 48]\n#Variables allow one to describe general problems,Lawrence S.

For example, it can be stated specifically that 5 minutes is equivalent to 60 \\times 5 300 seconds. A more general (algebraic) description may state that the number of seconds, s \n 60 \\times m, where m is  the number of minutes.\n#Variables allow one to describe mathematical relationships between quantities that may vary.Ron Larson, Kimberly Nolting, Elementary Algebra, Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2009, , 9780547102276, 622 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idU6v78M5nYKAC&lpg\nPP1&otsR0dl97lfm0&dq\n%22elementary%20algebra%22%20relationships&pgPA210#v\nonepage&qrelationships&f\nfalse page 210] For example, the relationship between the circumference, c, and diameter, d, of a circle is described by \\pi = c /d.\n#Variables allow one to describe some mathematical properties. For example, a basic property of addition is commutativity which states that the order of numbers being added together does not matter. Commutativity is stated algebraically as (a + b) (b + a).Charles P.

For example,\n*Added terms are simplified using coefficients. For example, x + x + x can be simplified as 3x (where 3 is a numerical coefficient).\n*Multiplied terms are simplified using exponents. For example, x \\times x \\times x is represented as x^3\n*Like terms are added together,Andrew Marx, Shortcut Algebra I: A Quick and Easy Way to Increase Your Algebra I Knowledge and Test Scores, Publisher Kaplan Publishing, 2007, , 9781419552885, 288 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?ido9GYQjZ7ZwUC&lpg\nPP1&otspT-MpWMJty&dq\nalgebra%20addition%20%22like%20terms%22&pgPA51#v\nonepage&qlike%20terms&f\nfalse page 51] for example, 2x^2 + 3ab - x^2 + ab is written as x^2 + 4ab, because the terms containing x^2 are added together, and, the terms containing ab are added together.\n*Brackets can be \"multiplied out\", using the distributive property. For example, x (2x + 3) can be written as (x \\times 2x) + (x \\times 3) which can be written as 2x^2 + 3x\n*Expressions can be factored. For example, 6x^5 + 3x^2, by dividing both terms by 3x^2 can be written as 3x^2 (2x^3 + 1)\n\nEquations \n\nAn equation states that two expressions are equal using the symbol for equality,  (the equals sign).Mark Clark, Cynthia Anfinson, Beginning Algebra: Connecting Concepts Through Applications, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2011, , 9780534419387, 793 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nwCzuRMC5048C&lpgPA134&ots\nUdyGuk1ihH&dqalgebra%20equation%20%22two%20expressions%22&pg\nPA134#vonepage&q\nequation&ffalse page 134] One of the most well-known equations describes Pythagoras' law relating the length of the sides of a right angle triangle:Alan S. Tussy, R. David Gustafson, Elementary and Intermediate Algebra, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2012, , 9781111567682, 1163 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nxqio_Xn4t7oC&lpgPA493&ots\npmzfzBO1KX&dqalgebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&pg\nPA493#vonepage&q\nalgebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&f=false page 493]\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nThis equation states that c^2, representing the square of the length of the side that is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), is equal to the sum (addition) of the squares of the other two sides whose lengths are represented by a and b.\n\nAn equation is the claim that two expressions have the same value and are equal. Some equations are true for all values of the involved variables (such as a + b b + a); such equations are called identities. Conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables, e.g. x^2 - 1 \n 8 is true only for x 3 and x \n -3. The values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through equation solving.\n\nAnother type of equation is an inequality. Inequalities are used to show that one side of the equation is greater, or less, than the other. The symbols used for this are:  a > b  where  >  represents 'greater than', and  a  where   represents 'less than'. Just like standard equality equations, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. The only exception is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be flipped.\n\nProperties of equality \n\nBy definition, equality is an equivalence relation, meaning it has the properties (a) reflexive (i.e. b b), (b) symmetric (i.e. if a \n b then b a) (c) transitive (i.e. if a \n b and b c then a \n c).Douglas Downing, Algebra the Easy Way, Publisher Barron's Educational Series, 2003, , 9780764119729, 392 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idRiX-TJLiQv0C&lpg\nPA20&otsBjArsBq8vc&dq\nalgebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&pgPA20#v\nonepage&qalgebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&f\nfalse page 20] It also satisfies the important property that if two symbols are used for equal things, then one symbol can be substituted for the other in any true statement about the first and the statement will remain true. This implies the following properties:\n\n* if a b and c \n d then a + c b + d and ac \n bd;\n* if a b then a + c \n b + c;\n* more generally, for any function f, if ab then f(a) \n f(b).\n\nProperties of inequality \n\nThe relations less than   and greater than  >  have the property of transitivity:Ron Larson, Robert Hostetler, Intermediate Algebra, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2008, , 9780618753529, 857 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idb3vqad8tbiAC&lpg\nPA96&otsFF2OYYGNCV&dq\nalgebra%20inequality%20properties&pgPA96#v\nonepage&qalgebra%20inequality%20properties&f\nfalse page 96]\n* If   a    and   b    then   a ;\n* If   a    and   c    then   a + c ;http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1043755/19368\n* If   a    and   c > 0   then   ac ;\n* If   a    and   c    then   bc .\nBy reversing the inequation,   and  >  can be swapped,Chris Carter, Physics: Facts and Practice for A Level, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2001, , 9780199147687, 144 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idFf9gxZPYafcC&lpg\nPA50&otsKQ5ufGdcHk&dq\nalgebra%20inequality%20less%20greater%20exchange&pgPA50#v\nonepage&qturned%20around&f\nfalse page 50] for example:\n* a  is equivalent to b > a\n\nSubstitution \n\nSubstitution is replacing the terms in an expression to create a new expression. Substituting 3 for a in the expression a*5 makes a new expression 3*5 with meaning 15. Substituting the terms of a statement makes a new statement. When the original statement is true independent of the values of the terms, the statement created by substitutions is also true. Hence definitions can be made in symbolic terms and interpreted through substitution: if a^2:a*a, where :\n means \"is defined to equal\", substituting 3 for a informs the reader of this statement that 3^2 means 3*39. Often it's not known whether the statement is true independent of the values of the terms, and substitution allows one to derive restrictions on the possible values, or show what conditions the statement holds under. For example, taking the statement x+1\n0, if x is substituted with 1, this imples 1+12\n0, which is false, which implies that if x+1=0 then x can't be 1.\n\nIf x and y are integers, rationals, or real numbers, then xy0 implies x\n0 or y0. Suppose abc\n0. Then, substituting a for x and bc for y, we learn a0 or bc\n0. Then we can substitute again, letting xb and y\nc, to show that if bc0 then b\n0 or c0. Therefore, if abc\n0, then a0 or (b\n0 or c0), so abc\n0 implies a0 or b\n0 or c=0.\n\nConsider if the original fact were stated as \"ab0 implies a\n0 or b0.\" Then when we say \"suppose abc\n0,\" we have a conflict of terms when we substitute. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if abc0 then a\n0 or b0 or c\n0 if instead of letting aa and b\nbc we substitute a for a and b for bc (and with bc0, substituting b for a and c for b). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression a into the a term of the original equation, the a substituted does not refer to the a in the statement \"ab\n0 implies a0 or b\n0.\"\n\nSolving algebraic equations \n\nThe following sections lay out examples of some of the types of algebraic equations that may be encountered.\n\nLinear equations with one variable \n\nLinear equations are so-called, because when they are plotted, they describe a straight line. The simplest equations to solve are linear equations that have only one variable. They contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. As an example, consider:\n\nProblem in words: If you double the age of a child and add 4, the resulting answer is 12. How old is the child?\n\nEquivalent equation: 2x + 4 = 12 where  x represent the child's age\n\nTo solve this kind of equation, the technique is add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.  Once the variable is isolated, the other side of the equation is the value of the variable. This problem and its solution are as follows:\n\nIn words: the child is 4 years old.\n\nThe general form of a linear equation with one variable, can be written as: ax+b=c\n\nFollowing the same procedure (i.e. subtract b from both sides, and then divide by a), the general solution is given by x=\\frac{c-b}{a}\n\nLinear equations with two variables \n\nA linear equation with two variables has many (i.e. an infinite number of) solutions.Sinha, The Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT 2/ePublisher: Pearson Education India, 2010, , 9788131723661, 599 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?ideOnaFSKRSR0C&lpg\nPA195&otsK9A5d10dUc&dq\nlinear%20equation%20%20two%20variables%20%20many%20solutions&pgPA195#v\nonepage&qmany%20solutions&f\nfalse page 195] For example:\n\nProblem in words: A father is 22 years older than his son. How old are they?\nEquivalent equation: y = x + 22 where y is the father's age, x is the son's age.\n\nThis cannot be worked out by itself. If the son's age was made known, then there would no longer be two unknowns (variables), and the problem becomes a linear equation with just one variable, that can be solved as described above.\n\nTo solve a linear equation with two variables (unknowns), requires two related equations. For example, if it was also revealed that:\n\nNow there are two related linear equations, each with two unknowns, which enables the production of a linear equation with just one variable, by subtracting one from the other (called the elimination method):Cynthia Y.

In 10 years time, the son will be 22, and the father will be twice his age, 44.

Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term ax^2, which is known as the quadratic term.  Hence a \\neq 0, and so we may divide by a and rearrange the equation into the standard form\n\nx^2 + px + q = 0 \n\nwhere p b/a and q \n c/a. Solving this, by a process known as completing the square, leads to the quadratic formula\n\nx=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a},\n\nwhere the symbol \"±\" indicates that both\n\n x\\frac{-b + \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x\n\\frac{-b - \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\nare solutions of the quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equations can also be solved using factorization (the reverse process of which is expansion, but for two linear terms is sometimes denoted foiling).  As an example of factoring:\n\nx^{2} + 3x - 10 = 0, \n\nwhich is the same thing as\n\n(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0. \n\nIt follows from the zero-product property that either x 2 or x \n -5 are the solutions, since precisely one of the factors must be equal to zero. All quadratic equations will have two solutions in the complex number system, but need not have any in the real number system. For example,\n\nx^{2} + 1 = 0 \n\nhas no real number solution since no real number squared equals −1.\nSometimes a quadratic equation has a root of multiplicity 2, such as:\n\n(x + 1)^2 = 0. \n\nFor this equation, −1 is a root of multiplicity 2. This means −1 appears two times, since the equation can be rewritten in factored form as\n\n[x-(-1)][x-(-1)]=0.\n\nComplex numbers\n\nAll quadratic equations have exactly two solutions in complex numbers (but they may be equal to each other), a category that includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums of real and imaginary numbers. Complex numbers first arise in the teaching of quadratic equations and the quadratic formula. For example, the quadratic equation\n\nx^2+x+1=0\n\nhas solutions\n\nx\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}  \\quad \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\quad x\n\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{-3}}{2}.\n\nSince \\sqrt{-3} is not any real number, both of these solutions for x are complex numbers.\n\nExponential and logarithmic equations \n\nAn exponential equation is one which has the form a^x b for a > 0,Aven Choo, LMAN OL Additional Maths Revision Guide 3, Publisher Pearson Education South Asia, 2007, , 9789810600013, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nNsBXDMrzcJIC&lpgRA2-PA29&ots\nWmZmHLaTey&dq%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20%3D%20b&pg\nRA2-PA29#vonepage&q\n%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20%20b&f\nfalse page 105] which has solution\n\nX \\log_a b \n \\frac{\\ln b}{\\ln a}\n\nwhen b > 0. Elementary algebraic techniques are used to rewrite a given equation in the above way before arriving at the solution. For example, if\n\n3 \\cdot 2^{x - 1} + 1 = 10\n\nthen, by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, and then dividing both sides by 3 we obtain\n\n2^{x - 1} = 3\n\nwhence\n\nx - 1 = \\log_2 3\n\nor\n\nx = \\log_2 3 + 1.\n\nA logarithmic equation is an equation of the form log_a(x) = b for a > 0, which has solution\n\nX = a^b.\n\nFor example, if\n\n4\\log_5(x - 3) - 2 = 6\n\nthen, by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, followed by dividing both sides by 4, we get\n\n\\log_5(x - 3) = 2\n\nwhence\n\nx - 3 5^2 \n 25\n\nfrom which we obtain\n\nx = 28.\n\nRadical equations \n\nA radical equation is one that includes a radical sign, which includes square roots, \\sqrt{x},  cube roots, \\sqrt[3]{x}, and nth roots, \\sqrt[n]{x}. Recall that an nth root can be rewritten in exponential format, so that \\sqrt[n]{x} is equivalent to x^{\\frac{1}{n}}.

It has real solution(s):\n\nFor example, if:\n\n(x + 5)^{2/3} = 4,\n\nthen\n\n\\begin{align}\nx + 5 & = \\pm (\\sqrt{4})^3\\\\\nx + 5 & = \\pm 8\\\\\nx &  = -5 \\pm 8\\\\\nx & = 3,-13\n\\end{align}.\n\nSystem of linear equations \n\nThere are different methods to solve a system of linear equations with two variables.\n\nElimination method \n\nAn example of solving a system of linear equations is by using the elimination method:\n\n\\begin{cases}4x + 2y&= 14 \\\\\n2x - y&= 1.\\end{cases} \n\nMultiplying the terms in the second equation by 2:\n\n4x + 2y = 14 \n4x - 2y = 2. \n\nAdding the two equations together to get:\n\n8x = 16 \n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nx = 2. \n\nSince the fact that x 2 is known, it is then possible to deduce that y \n 3  by either of the original two equations (by using 2 instead of x ) The full solution to this problem is then\n\n\\begin{cases} x 2 \\\\ y \n 3. \\end{cases}\n\nNote that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; y could have been solved before x.\n\nSubstitution method \n\nAnother way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution.\n\n\\begin{cases}4x + 2y &= 14\n\\\\ 2x - y &= 1.\\end{cases} \n\nAn equivalent for y can be deduced by using one of the two equations. Using the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 1 \n\nSubtracting 2x from each side of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align}2x - 2x - y & = 1 - 2x  \\\\\n- y & = 1 - 2x\n\\end{align}\n\nand multiplying by −1:\n\n y = 2x - 1. \n\nUsing this y value in the first equation in the original system:\n\n\\begin{align}4x + 2(2x - 1) &= 14\\\\\n4x + 4x - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n8x - 2 &= 14 \\end{align}\n\nAdding 2 on each side of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align}8x - 2 + 2 &= 14 + 2 \\\\\n8x &= 16 \\end{align}\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nx = 2 \n\nUsing this value in one of the equations, the same solution as in the previous method is obtained.\n\n\\begin{cases} x 2 \\\\ y \n 3. \\end{cases}\n\nNote that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; in this case as well, y could have been solved before x.\n\nOther types of systems of linear equations \n\nInconsistent systems \n\nIn the above example, a solution exists. However, there are also systems of equations which do not have any solution. Such a system is called inconsistent. An obvious example is\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align} x + y &= 1 \\\\\n0x + 0y &= 2\\,. \\end{align} \\end{cases}\n\nAs 0≠2, the second equation in the system has no solution. Therefore, the system has no solution.\nHowever, not all inconsistent systems are recognized at first sight. As an example, let us consider the system \n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y &= 12 \\\\\n-2x - y &= -4\\,. \\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nMultiplying by 2 both sides of the second equation, and adding it to the first one results in\n0x+0y = 4 \\,,\nwhich has clearly no solution.\n\nUndetermined systems \n\nThere are also systems which have infinitely many solutions, in contrast to a system with a unique solution (meaning, a unique pair of values for x and y) For example:\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y & = 12 \\\\\n-2x - y & = -6 \\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nIsolating y in the second equation:\n\ny = -2x + 6 \n\nAnd using this value in the first equation in the system:\n\n\\begin{align}4x + 2(-2x + 6) = 12 \\\\\n4x - 4x + 12 = 12 \\\\\n12 = 12 \\end{align}\n\nThe equality is true, but it does not provide a value for x. Indeed, one can easily verify (by just filling in some values of x) that for any x there is a solution as long as y = -2x + 6. There is an infinite number of solutions for this system.\n\nOver- and underdetermined systems \n\nSystems with more variables than the number of linear equations are called underdetermined. Such a system, if it has any solutions, does not have a unique one but rather an infinitude of them. An example of such a system is\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}x + 2y & = 10\\\\\ny - z  & = 2 .\\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nWhen trying to solve it, one is led to express some variables as functions of the other ones if any solutions exist, but cannot express all solutions numerically because there are an infinite number of them if there are any.\n\nA system with a greater number of equations than variables is called overdetermined. If an overdetermined system has any solutions, necessarily some equations are linear combinations of the others.",

Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers.\n\nThe use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic equations.\n\nAlgebraic notation \n\nAlgebraic notation describes how algebra is written. It follows certain rules and conventions, and has its own terminology. For example, the expression 3x^2 - 2xy + c has the following components:\n\n1 : Exponent (power), 2 : Coefficient, 3 : term, 4 : operator, 5 : constant, x, y : variables\n\nA coefficient is a numerical value, or letter representing a numerical constant, that multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A term is an addend or a summand, a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.Richard N.

For example, x \\times x \\times x is represented as x^3\n*Like terms are added together,Andrew Marx, Shortcut Algebra I: A Quick and Easy Way to Increase Your Algebra I Knowledge and Test Scores, Publisher Kaplan Publishing, 2007, , 9781419552885, 288 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?ido9GYQjZ7ZwUC&lpg\nPP1&otspT-MpWMJty&dq\nalgebra%20addition%20%22like%20terms%22&pgPA51#v\nonepage&qlike%20terms&f\nfalse page 51] for example, 2x^2 + 3ab - x^2 + ab is written as x^2 + 4ab, because the terms containing x^2 are added together, and, the terms containing ab are added together.\n*Brackets can be \"multiplied out\", using the distributive property. For example, x (2x + 3) can be written as (x \\times 2x) + (x \\times 3) which can be written as 2x^2 + 3x\n*Expressions can be factored. For example, 6x^5 + 3x^2, by dividing both terms by 3x^2 can be written as 3x^2 (2x^3 + 1)\n\nEquations \n\nAn equation states that two expressions are equal using the symbol for equality,  (the equals sign).Mark Clark, Cynthia Anfinson, Beginning Algebra: Connecting Concepts Through Applications, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2011, , 9780534419387, 793 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nwCzuRMC5048C&lpgPA134&ots\nUdyGuk1ihH&dqalgebra%20equation%20%22two%20expressions%22&pg\nPA134#vonepage&q\nequation&ffalse page 134] One of the most well-known equations describes Pythagoras' law relating the length of the sides of a right angle triangle:Alan S. Tussy, R. David Gustafson, Elementary and Intermediate Algebra, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2012, , 9781111567682, 1163 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nxqio_Xn4t7oC&lpgPA493&ots\npmzfzBO1KX&dqalgebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&pg\nPA493#vonepage&q\nalgebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&f=false page 493]\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nThis equation states that c^2, representing the square of the length of the side that is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), is equal to the sum (addition) of the squares of the other two sides whose lengths are represented by a and b.\n\nAn equation is the claim that two expressions have the same value and are equal. Some equations are true for all values of the involved variables (such as a + b b + a); such equations are called identities. Conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables, e.g. x^2 - 1 \n 8 is true only for x 3 and x \n -3. The values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through equation solving.\n\nAnother type of equation is an inequality. Inequalities are used to show that one side of the equation is greater, or less, than the other. The symbols used for this are:  a > b  where  >  represents 'greater than', and  a  where   represents 'less than'. Just like standard equality equations, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. The only exception is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be flipped.\n\nProperties of equality \n\nBy definition, equality is an equivalence relation, meaning it has the properties (a) reflexive (i.e. b b), (b) symmetric (i.e. if a \n b then b a) (c) transitive (i.e. if a \n b and b c then a \n c).Douglas Downing, Algebra the Easy Way, Publisher Barron's Educational Series, 2003, , 9780764119729, 392 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idRiX-TJLiQv0C&lpg\nPA20&otsBjArsBq8vc&dq\nalgebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&pgPA20#v\nonepage&qalgebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&f\nfalse page 20] It also satisfies the important property that if two symbols are used for equal things, then one symbol can be substituted for the other in any true statement about the first and the statement will remain true. This implies the following properties:\n\n* if a b and c \n d then a + c b + d and ac \n bd;\n* if a b then a + c \n b + c;\n* more generally, for any function f, if ab then f(a) \n f(b).\n\nProperties of inequality \n\nThe relations less than   and greater than  >  have the property of transitivity:Ron Larson, Robert Hostetler, Intermediate Algebra, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2008, , 9780618753529, 857 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idb3vqad8tbiAC&lpg\nPA96&otsFF2OYYGNCV&dq\nalgebra%20inequality%20properties&pgPA96#v\nonepage&qalgebra%20inequality%20properties&f\nfalse page 96]\n* If   a    and   b    then   a ;\n* If   a    and   c    then   a + c ;http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1043755/19368\n* If   a    and   c > 0   then   ac ;\n* If   a    and   c    then   bc .\nBy reversing the inequation,   and  >  can be swapped,Chris Carter, Physics: Facts and Practice for A Level, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2001, , 9780199147687, 144 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idFf9gxZPYafcC&lpg\nPA50&otsKQ5ufGdcHk&dq\nalgebra%20inequality%20less%20greater%20exchange&pgPA50#v\nonepage&qturned%20around&f\nfalse page 50] for example:\n* a  is equivalent to b > a\n\nSubstitution \n\nSubstitution is replacing the terms in an expression to create a new expression. Substituting 3 for a in the expression a*5 makes a new expression 3*5 with meaning 15. Substituting the terms of a statement makes a new statement. When the original statement is true independent of the values of the terms, the statement created by substitutions is also true. Hence definitions can be made in symbolic terms and interpreted through substitution: if a^2:a*a, where :\n means \"is defined to equal\", substituting 3 for a informs the reader of this statement that 3^2 means 3*39. Often it's not known whether the statement is true independent of the values of the terms, and substitution allows one to derive restrictions on the possible values, or show what conditions the statement holds under. For example, taking the statement x+1\n0, if x is substituted with 1, this imples 1+12\n0, which is false, which implies that if x+1=0 then x can't be 1.\n\nIf x and y are integers, rationals, or real numbers, then xy0 implies x\n0 or y0. Suppose abc\n0. Then, substituting a for x and bc for y, we learn a0 or bc\n0. Then we can substitute again, letting xb and y\nc, to show that if bc0 then b\n0 or c0. Therefore, if abc\n0, then a0 or (b\n0 or c0), so abc\n0 implies a0 or b\n0 or c=0.\n\nConsider if the original fact were stated as \"ab0 implies a\n0 or b0.\" Then when we say \"suppose abc\n0,\" we have a conflict of terms when we substitute. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if abc0 then a\n0 or b0 or c\n0 if instead of letting aa and b\nbc we substitute a for a and b for bc (and with bc0, substituting b for a and c for b). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression a into the a term of the original equation, the a substituted does not refer to the a in the statement \"ab\n0 implies a0 or b\n0.\"\n\nSolving algebraic equations \n\nThe following sections lay out examples of some of the types of algebraic equations that may be encountered.\n\nLinear equations with one variable \n\nLinear equations are so-called, because when they are plotted, they describe a straight line. The simplest equations to solve are linear equations that have only one variable. They contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. As an example, consider:\n\nProblem in words: If you double the age of a child and add 4, the resulting answer is 12. How old is the child?\n\nEquivalent equation: 2x + 4 = 12 where  x represent the child's age\n\nTo solve this kind of equation, the technique is add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.  Once the variable is isolated, the other side of the equation is the value of the variable. This problem and its solution are as follows:\n\nIn words: the child is 4 years old.\n\nThe general form of a linear equation with one variable, can be written as: ax+b=c\n\nFollowing the same procedure (i.e. subtract b from both sides, and then divide by a), the general solution is given by x=\\frac{c-b}{a}\n\nLinear equations with two variables \n\nA linear equation with two variables has many (i.e. an infinite number of) solutions.Sinha, The Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT 2/ePublisher: Pearson Education India, 2010, , 9788131723661, 599 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?ideOnaFSKRSR0C&lpg\nPA195&otsK9A5d10dUc&dq\nlinear%20equation%20%20two%20variables%20%20many%20solutions&pgPA195#v\nonepage&qmany%20solutions&f\nfalse page 195] For example:\n\nProblem in words: A father is 22 years older than his son. How old are they?\nEquivalent equation: y = x + 22 where y is the father's age, x is the son's age.\n\nThis cannot be worked out by itself. If the son's age was made known, then there would no longer be two unknowns (variables), and the problem becomes a linear equation with just one variable, that can be solved as described above.\n\nTo solve a linear equation with two variables (unknowns), requires two related equations. For example, if it was also revealed that:\n\nNow there are two related linear equations, each with two unknowns, which enables the production of a linear equation with just one variable, by subtracting one from the other (called the elimination method):Cynthia Y. Young, Precalculus, Publisher John Wiley & Sons, 2010, , 9780471756842, 1175 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id9HRLAn326zEC&lpg\nPA703&otst83cFBL8TU&dq\nlinear%20equation%20%20two%20variables%20%20many%20solutions&pgPA699#v\nonepage&qlinear%20equation%20%20two%20variables%20%20many%20solutions&f\nfalse page 699]\n\nIn other words, the son is aged 12, and since the father 22 years older, he must be 34. In 10 years time, the son will be 22, and the father will be twice his age, 44. This problem is illustrated on the associated plot of the equations.\n\nFor other ways to solve this kind of equations, see below, System of linear equations.\n\nQuadratic equations \n\nA quadratic equation is one which includes a term with an exponent of 2, for example, x^2,Mary Jane Sterling, Algebra II For Dummies, Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, 2006, , 9780471775812, 384 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id_0rTMuSpTY0C&lpg\nPA43&otsJ8_1q1Vkul&dq\nquadratic%20equations&pgPA37#v\nonepage&qquadratic%20equations&f\nfalse page 37] and no term with higher exponent. The name derives from the Latin quadrus, meaning square.John T. Irwin, The Mystery to a Solution: Poe, Borges, and the Analytic Detective Story, Publisher JHU Press, 1996, , 9780801854668, 512 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idjsxTenuOQKgC&lpg\nPA372&otsT7p7Porq55&dq\nquadratic%20quadrus&pgPA372#v\nonepage&qquadratic%20quadrus&f\nfalse page 372] In general, a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form ax^2 + bx + c 0,Sharma/khattar, The Pearson Guide To Objective Mathematics For Engineering Entrance Examinations, 3/E, Publisher Pearson Education India, 2010, , 9788131723630, 1248 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n2v-f9x7-FlsC&lpgRA13-PA33&ots\nP-Dz70fXbv&dqquadratic%20equations%20%20ax2%20%2B%20bx%20%2B%20c%20%3D%200&pg\nRA13-PA33#vonepage&q&f\nfalse page 621] where a is not zero (if it were zero, then the equation would not be quadratic but linear). Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term ax^2, which is known as the quadratic term.  Hence a \\neq 0, and so we may divide by a and rearrange the equation into the standard form\n\nx^2 + px + q = 0 \n\nwhere p b/a and q \n c/a. Solving this, by a process known as completing the square, leads to the quadratic formula\n\nx=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a},\n\nwhere the symbol \"±\" indicates that both\n\n x\\frac{-b + \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x\n\\frac{-b - \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\nare solutions of the quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equations can also be solved using factorization (the reverse process of which is expansion, but for two linear terms is sometimes denoted foiling).  As an example of factoring:\n\nx^{2} + 3x - 10 = 0, \n\nwhich is the same thing as\n\n(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0. \n\nIt follows from the zero-product property that either x 2 or x \n -5 are the solutions, since precisely one of the factors must be equal to zero. All quadratic equations will have two solutions in the complex number system, but need not have any in the real number system. For example,\n\nx^{2} + 1 = 0 \n\nhas no real number solution since no real number squared equals −1.\nSometimes a quadratic equation has a root of multiplicity 2, such as:\n\n(x + 1)^2 = 0. \n\nFor this equation, −1 is a root of multiplicity 2. This means −1 appears two times, since the equation can be rewritten in factored form as\n\n[x-(-1)][x-(-1)]=0.\n\nComplex numbers\n\nAll quadratic equations have exactly two solutions in complex numbers (but they may be equal to each other), a category that includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums of real and imaginary numbers. Complex numbers first arise in the teaching of quadratic equations and the quadratic formula. For example, the quadratic equation\n\nx^2+x+1=0\n\nhas solutions\n\nx\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}  \\quad \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\quad x\n\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{-3}}{2}.\n\nSince \\sqrt{-3} is not any real number, both of these solutions for x are complex numbers.\n\nExponential and logarithmic equations \n\nAn exponential equation is one which has the form a^x b for a > 0,Aven Choo, LMAN OL Additional Maths Revision Guide 3, Publisher Pearson Education South Asia, 2007, , 9789810600013, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nNsBXDMrzcJIC&lpgRA2-PA29&ots\nWmZmHLaTey&dq%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20%3D%20b&pg\nRA2-PA29#vonepage&q\n%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20%20b&f\nfalse page 105] which has solution\n\nX \\log_a b \n \\frac{\\ln b}{\\ln a}\n\nwhen b > 0. Elementary algebraic techniques are used to rewrite a given equation in the above way before arriving at the solution. For example, if\n\n3 \\cdot 2^{x - 1} + 1 = 10\n\nthen, by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, and then dividing both sides by 3 we obtain\n\n2^{x - 1} = 3\n\nwhence\n\nx - 1 = \\log_2 3\n\nor\n\nx = \\log_2 3 + 1.\n\nA logarithmic equation is an equation of the form log_a(x) = b for a > 0, which has solution\n\nX = a^b.\n\nFor example, if\n\n4\\log_5(x - 3) - 2 = 6\n\nthen, by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, followed by dividing both sides by 4, we get\n\n\\log_5(x - 3) = 2\n\nwhence\n\nx - 3 5^2 \n 25\n\nfrom which we obtain\n\nx = 28.\n\nRadical equations \n\nA radical equation is one that includes a radical sign, which includes square roots, \\sqrt{x},  cube roots, \\sqrt[3]{x}, and nth roots, \\sqrt[n]{x}. Recall that an nth root can be rewritten in exponential format, so that \\sqrt[n]{x} is equivalent to x^{\\frac{1}{n}}. Combined with regular exponents (powers), then  \\sqrt[2]{x^3} (the square root of x cubed), can be rewritten as x^{\\frac{3}{2}}.John C. Peterson, Technical Mathematics With Calculus, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2003, , 9780766861893, 1613 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?idPGuSDjHvircC&lpg\nPA525&otsNKrt__3KKE&dq\n%22%20radical%20equation%22&pgPA525#v\nonepage&q%22%20radical%20equation%22&f\nfalse page 525] So a common form of a radical equation is  \\sqrt[n]{x^m}a (equivalent to  x^\\frac{m}{n}\na) where m and n are integers. It has real solution(s):\n\nFor example, if:\n\n(x + 5)^{2/3} = 4,\n\nthen\n\n\\begin{align}\nx + 5 & = \\pm (\\sqrt{4})^3\\\\\nx + 5 & = \\pm 8\\\\\nx &  = -5 \\pm 8\\\\\nx & = 3,-13\n\\end{align}.\n\nSystem of linear equations \n\nThere are different methods to solve a system of linear equations with two variables.\n\nElimination method \n\nAn example of solving a system of linear equations is by using the elimination method:\n\n\\begin{cases}4x + 2y&= 14 \\\\\n2x - y&= 1.\\end{cases} \n\nMultiplying the terms in the second equation by 2:\n\n4x + 2y = 14 \n4x - 2y = 2. \n\nAdding the two equations together to get:\n\n8x = 16 \n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nx = 2. \n\nSince the fact that x 2 is known, it is then possible to deduce that y \n 3  by either of the original two equations (by using 2 instead of x ) The full solution to this problem is then\n\n\\begin{cases} x 2 \\\\ y \n 3. \\end{cases}\n\nNote that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; y could have been solved before x.\n\nSubstitution method \n\nAnother way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution.\n\n\\begin{cases}4x + 2y &= 14\n\\\\ 2x - y &= 1.\\end{cases} \n\nAn equivalent for y can be deduced by using one of the two equations. Using the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 1 \n\nSubtracting 2x from each side of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align}2x - 2x - y & = 1 - 2x  \\\\\n- y & = 1 - 2x\n\\end{align}\n\nand multiplying by −1:\n\n y = 2x - 1. \n\nUsing this y value in the first equation in the original system:\n\n\\begin{align}4x + 2(2x - 1) &= 14\\\\\n4x + 4x - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n8x - 2 &= 14 \\end{align}\n\nAdding 2 on each side of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align}8x - 2 + 2 &= 14 + 2 \\\\\n8x &= 16 \\end{align}\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nx = 2 \n\nUsing this value in one of the equations, the same solution as in the previous method is obtained.\n\n\\begin{cases} x 2 \\\\ y \n 3. \\end{cases}\n\nNote that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; in this case as well, y could have been solved before x.\n\nOther types of systems of linear equations \n\nInconsistent systems \n\nIn the above example, a solution exists. However, there are also systems of equations which do not have any solution. Such a system is called inconsistent. An obvious example is\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align} x + y &= 1 \\\\\n0x + 0y &= 2\\,. \\end{align} \\end{cases}\n\nAs 0≠2, the second equation in the system has no solution. Therefore, the system has no solution.\nHowever, not all inconsistent systems are recognized at first sight. As an example, let us consider the system \n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y &= 12 \\\\\n-2x - y &= -4\\,. \\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nMultiplying by 2 both sides of the second equation, and adding it to the first one results in\n0x+0y = 4 \\,,\nwhich has clearly no solution.\n\nUndetermined systems \n\nThere are also systems which have infinitely many solutions, in contrast to a system with a unique solution (meaning, a unique pair of values for x and y) For example:\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y & = 12 \\\\\n-2x - y & = -6 \\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nIsolating y in the second equation:\n\ny = -2x + 6 \n\nAnd using this value in the first equation in the system:\n\n\\begin{align}4x + 2(-2x + 6) = 12 \\\\\n4x - 4x + 12 = 12 \\\\\n12 = 12 \\end{align}\n\nThe equality is true, but it does not provide a value for x. Indeed, one can easily verify (by just filling in some values of x) that for any x there is a solution as long as y = -2x + 6. There is an infinite number of solutions for this system.\n\nOver- and underdetermined systems \n\nSystems with more variables than the number of linear equations are called underdetermined. Such a system, if it has any solutions, does not have a unique one but rather an infinitude of them. An example of such a system is\n\n\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}x + 2y & = 10\\\\\ny - z  & = 2 .\\end{align}\\end{cases}\n\nWhen trying to solve it, one is led to express some variables as functions of the other ones if any solutions exist, but cannot express all solutions numerically because there are an infinite number of them if there are any.\n\nA system with a greater number of equations than variables is called overdetermined. If an overdetermined system has any solutions, necessarily some equations are linear combinations of the others. Elementary algebra. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9710."
