  "textBody" : "Transport in Hungary relies on several main modes, including transport by road, rail, air and water.\n\nRoads\n\nHungary has a total of 159568 km of public roads, of which 70050 km are paved (including 1481 km of motorways, as of 2016); and 89518 km are unpaved (2005 etc.):\n\nHungarian road categories are as follows:\n* Gyorsforgalmi út (controlled-access highway):\n**Autópálya (motorway): 2+2 travel lanes and 1+1 emergency lane, central reservation, no at-grade intersections, speed limit 130 km/h \n**Gyorsút (high-speed highway): 2+2 travel lanes, central reservation, few at-grade intersections, speed limit 110 km/h \n**Autóút (expressway): 2+2, 2+1 or 1+1 travel lanes, central reservation, some at-grade intersections, speed limit 110 km/h \n*Elsődrendő főút (primary arterial road or primary main road) (with one-digit number, e.g. 6-os főút)\n*Másodrendű főút (secondary main road) (with two or three digits, e.g. 57-es főút)\n*Helyi út (local road) (with three or more digits, e.g. 4519-es közút)\n\nMotorways and expressways\n\nHungarian motorways and expressways are part of the national road network. As of October 2016, there are 1481 km of controlled-access highways.\n\n Motorways (autópályák, singular - autópálya) in Hungary:\nM1 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M15 | M19 | M30 | M31 | M35 | M43 | M60 \n\n Expressways (autóutak, singular - autóút) in Hungary:\nM0 | M2 | M9 | M51 |\nM70 | M85 | M86\n\nNew motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.\n\nBus transport\n\nBus transport between municipalities was provided by Volán Companies, twenty-four bus companies founded in 1970 and named after the regions they served. They also provided local transport in cities and towns that did not have their own public transport company (all cities except for Budapest, Miskolc, Pécs, Kaposvár and also Debrecen after 2009), and operated bus lines in cities where the local company operated only tram and trolley bus lines (Szeged and Debrecen, the latter until 2009, when DKV took over the bus lines). In early 2015 the 24 companies were organized into seven regional companies.\n\nRailways\n\nNote: Hungary and Austria jointly manage the cross-border standard-gauge railway between Győr–Sopron–Ebenfurt (GySEV/ROeEE), a distance of about 101 km in Hungary and 65 km in Austria.\n\nIn Budapest, the three main railway stations are the Eastern (Keleti), Western (Nyugati) and Southern (Déli), with other outlying stations like Kelenföld. Of the three, the Southern is the most modern but the Eastern and the Western are more decorative and architecturally interesting.\n\nOther important railway stations countrywide include Szolnok (the most important railway intersection outside Budapest), Tiszai Railway Station in Miskolc and the stations of Pécs, Győr, Debrecen, Szeged and Székesfehérvár.\n\nThe only city with an underground railway system is Budapest with its Metro.\n\nIn Budapest there is also a suburban rail service in and around the city, operated under the name HÉV.\n\nRail system\n\n* Total: 7,606 km\n** Standard gauge: 7,394 km  gauge (2,911 km electrified; 1,236 km double track)\n** Broad gauge: 36 km  gauge\n** Narrow gauge: 176 km  gauge (1998)\n\nRail links with adjacent countries\n\n* Same gauge:\n** Austria (6 line)\n** Croatia (3 line)\n** Romania (5 line)\n** Serbia (2 line)\n** Slovakia (10 line)\n** Slovenia (1 line)\n* Break-of-gauge –  / \n** Ukraine (2 line)\n\nAirports\n\nThere are 43-45 airports in Hungary, including smaller, unpaved airports, too. The five international airports are Budapest-Liszt Ferenc, Debrecen Airport, Hévíz–Balaton International Airport (previously Sármellék, also called FlyBalaton for its proximity to Lake Balaton, Hungary's number one tourist attraction), Győr-Pér and Pécs-Pogány (as of 2015. there are no regular passenger flights from Győr-Pér and Pécs-Pogány).
