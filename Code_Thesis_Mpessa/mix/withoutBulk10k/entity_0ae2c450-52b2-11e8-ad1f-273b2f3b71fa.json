  "textBody" : "Henry Bordeaux (25 January 1870 – 29 March 1963) was a French writer and lawyer.\n\nBordeaux came from a family of lawyers of Savoy. He was born in Thonon-les-Bains, Haute-Savoie. His grandfather was a magistrate and his father served on the Chambéry bar. During his early life, he relocated between Savoy and Paris and the tensions between provincial and city life influenced his writings. In his professional life he observed closely the dissolution of numerous families and analysed the causes and consequences of these. From the age of seventeen he spent three years in Paris studying law. Then he returned to practice law in Savoy. He returned to Paris after the publication of his first book during 1894. When his father died in 1896 he returned to Savoy.\n\nThe writings of Bordeaux reflect the values of traditional provincial Catholic communities. One recurring theme is loyalty.
