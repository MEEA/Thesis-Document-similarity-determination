  "textBody" : "Garage Inc. is a compilation album of cover songs by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on November 23, 1998 through Elektra Records. Over 2.5 million copies have been sold in the U.S. as certified by the RIAA. It includes cover songs, B-side covers, and The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had gone out of print since its original release in 1987. The title is a combination of Garage Days Revisited and their song \"Damage, Inc.\", from Master of Puppets, and the album's graphical cover draws heavily from the 1987 EP. The album features songs by artists that have influenced Metallica, including many bands from the new wave of British heavy metal movement, hardcore punk bands and popular songs. As of August 2013, the album has sold more than 6 million copies worldwide.\n\nProduction\n\nThe day after Metallica finished the North American leg of the Poor Re-Touring Me Tour in San Diego's Coors Amphitheatre, they hit the studio to start recording a new album of cover versions.[https://books.google.com/books?idmBlbAwAAQBAJ&pg\nPT334 Metallica: Justice for All], p.333-4 As Lars Ulrich explained, the band wanted to do something different after \"three pretty serious albums in a row, starting with the Black album and then Load and ReLoad\", and the process would be easier by working with covers, specially as the band had a tradition of taking other people's songs  and  \"turn them into something very Metallica, different from what the original artist did\". Given the band had recorded many covers that were spread across various releases, such as B-sides of their singles and the 1987 EP The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, the band would \"put them all in a nice little packaging for easy listening\" along with the newly recorded cover versions, chosen through a group decision. Only one of the eleven songs in the \"New Recordings '98\" disk was not done in the three-week sessions, a version of Lynyrd Skynyrd's  \"Tuesday's Gone\" the band recorded for a radio broadcast along with friends such as Les Claypool, John Popper and Gary Rossington.\n\nPackaging\n\nThe cover for Garage Inc. had a Ross Halfin photograph of Metallica dressed as mechanics. The band wanted the booklet to hold a detailed account of the contents of the project, and designer Andy Airfix was allowed to search through Ulrich's catalogue of Metallica memorabilia in San Francisco to create a 32-page booklet.
