  "textBody" : "In economics, the Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or of wealth. It was developed by Max O. Lorenz in 1905 for representing inequality of the wealth distribution.\n\nThe curve is a graph showing the proportion of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom x% of the people, although this is not rigorously true for a finite population (see below). It is often used to represent income distribution, where it shows for the bottom x% of households, what percentage (y%) of the total income they have. The percentage of households is plotted on the x-axis, the percentage of income on the y-axis.  It can also be used to show distribution of assets.  In such use, many economists consider it to be a measure of social inequality.\n\nThe concept is useful in describing inequality among the size of individuals in ecology and in studies of biodiversity, where the cumulative proportion of species is plotted against the cumulative proportion of individuals. It is also useful in business modeling: e.g., in consumer finance, to measure the actual percentage y% of delinquencies attributable to the x% of people with worst risk scores.\n\nExplanation\n\nPoints on the Lorenz curve represent statements like \"the bottom 20% of all households have 10% of the total income.\"\n\nA perfectly equal income distribution would be one in which every person has the same income.  In this case, the bottom N% of society would always have N% of the income.  This can be depicted by the straight line y = x; called the \"line of perfect equality.\"\n\nBy contrast, a perfectly unequal distribution would be one in which one person has all the income and everyone else has none.  In that case, the curve would be at y 0% for all x i, i 1 to n, that are indexed in non-decreasing order ( yi ≤ yi+1), the Lorenz curve is the continuous piecewise linear function connecting the points ( Fi, Li ), i \n 0 to n, where F0 0, L0 \n 0, and for i = 1 to n:\nF_i = i/n\\,\nS_i \\Sigma_{j\n1}^i \\; y_j\\,\nL_i = S_i / S_n \\, \n\nFor a discrete probability function f(y), let yi, i 1 to n, be the points with non-zero probabilities indexed in increasing order ( yi i+1).  The Lorenz curve is the continuous piecewise linear function connecting the points ( Fi, Li ), i \n 0 to n, where F0 0, L0 \n 0, and for i = 1 to n:\nF_i \\Sigma_{j\n1}^i \\; f(y_j)\\,\nS_i \\Sigma_{j\n1}^i \\; f(y_j)\\,y_j\\,\nL_i = S_i / S_n \\, \n\nFor a probability density function f(x) with the cumulative distribution function  F(x), the Lorenz curve L is given by:\n\n L(F(x))\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{x} t\\,f(t)\\,dt}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty t\\,f(t)\\,dt} \n\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{x} t\\,f(t)\\,dt}{\\mu} \n\nwhere \\mu denotes the average.

In other contexts, the quantity computed here is known as the length biased (or size biased) distribution; it also has an important role in renewal theory.\n\nAlternatively, for a cumulative distribution function F(x) with inverse x(F), the Lorenz curve L(F) is directly given by:\n\n L(F)=\\frac{\\int_0^F x(F_1)\\,dF_1}{\\int_0^1 x(F_1)\\,dF_1} \n\nThe inverse x(F) may not exist because the cumulative distribution function has intervals of constant values.
