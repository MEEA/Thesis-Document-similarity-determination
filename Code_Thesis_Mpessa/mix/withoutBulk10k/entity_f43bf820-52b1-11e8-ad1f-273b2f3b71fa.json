  "textBody" : "The estampie (, Occitan and , ) is a medieval dance and musical form which was a popular instrumental and vocal form in the 13th and 14th centuries. The name was also applied to poetry . \n\nMusical form\n\nThe estampie is similar in form to the lai, consisting of a succession of repeated sections . According to Johannes de Grocheio, there were both vocal and instrumental estampies (for which he used the Latin calque \"stantipes\"), which differed somewhat in form, in that the vocal estampie begins with a refrain, which is repeated at the end of each verse . Also according to Grocheio, the repeating sections in both the vocal and instrumental estampie were called puncta (singular punctus) , in the form: \n\naa, bb, cc, etc..\n\nThe two statements of each punctus differ only in their endings, described as apertum (\"open\") and clausum (\"closed\") by Grocheio, who believed that six puncta were standard for the stantipes (his term for the estampie), though he was aware of stantipes with seven puncta . The structure can therefore be diagrammed as: \n\na+x, a+y; b+w, b+z; etc..\n\nSometimes the same two endings are used for all the puncta, producing the structure \n\na+x, a+y; b+x, b+y, c+x, c+y, etc.. \"Punctus autem est ordinata aggregatio concordantiarum harmoniam facientium\nascendendo et descendendo duas habens partes in principio similes, in fine\ndifferentes, qui clausum et apertum communiter appellantur.\"\n\nA similar structure was shared with the saltarello, another medieval dance.\n\nThe earliest reported example of this musical form is the song \"Kalenda maya\", written by the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras (1180–1207) to the melody of an estampida played by French jongleurs . \"Two poetry treatises describe the estampie as a poetic and musical form, and a music treatise provides details about it as both a vocal form and an instrumental dance\" .
