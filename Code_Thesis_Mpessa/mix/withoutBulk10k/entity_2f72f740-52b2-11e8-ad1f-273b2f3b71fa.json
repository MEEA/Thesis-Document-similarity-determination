  "textBody" : "Lomography is a commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, which their creators associate to a photographic image style and an analog camera movement and community facilitated by The Lomographic Society International.  \n\nThe Lomographic Society International was founded in 1992 by a group of Viennese students after they discovered the LCA, a camera created by LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Lomography started as an art movement through which the students put on exhibitions of photos within Vienna; the art movement then developed into a commercial enterprise. Since 1995, Lomography has been the sole distributor of the LC-A camera outside  the former Soviet Union, and has moved into producing their own range of analog cameras, films and accessories.\n\nHistory\n\nThe lomography name is inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia that created and produced the 35 mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera, now central to lomography. This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s.\n\nLomography also represents the commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, an Austrian company that produces cameras and accessories. The society is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIn 1991, a group of Viennese students discovered the LOMO LC-A and were inspired by its \"unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry\" images. The Lomographic Society International was subsequently founded in 1992. After a series of art exhibitions culminating in shows in New York City and Moscow, Lomography signed an exclusive distribution agreement with LOMO PLC in 1995 — becoming the sole distributor of all LOMO LC-A cameras outside of the former Soviet Union. The new company reached an agreement with the deputy mayor of St Petersburg, the future Russian Prime Minister and President, Vladimir Putin, to receive a tax break in order to keep the LOMO factory in the city open.\n\nSince the introduction of the original LOMO LC-A, Lomography has produced a line of their own analog cameras. In 2005, production of the original LOMO LC-A was discontinued. Its replacement, the LOMO LC-A+, was introduced in 2006. The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC. This changed as of mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well. In 2012 the LC-A+ camera was re-released as a special edition. \n\nLomography has also released products catered to digital devices, such as the Smartphone Film Scanner; and the Achromat lens collection for SLR cameras with Canon EF, Nikon F or Pentax K mounts, inspired by 19th century Daguerreotype photography.\n\nModels\n\nCameras that have been marketed by Lomographische AG:\n*LOMO LC-A+\n*Diana F+\n*Spinner 360°\n*Sprocket Rocket\n*Actionsampler\n*Pop-9\n*Oktomat\n*Fisheye\n*Fisheye 2\n*Colorsplash\n*Colorsplash Flash\n*SuperSampler\n*La Sardina\n*LomoKino - a 35 mm analog movie camera\n*Diana Baby - 110 film\n*Fisheye Baby - 110 film\n*Konstruktor - a build-it-yourself 35 mm SLR camera\n*Fritz the Blitz\n\nIn 2013, together with Zenit, Lomography produced a new version of the Petzval Lens designed to work with Canon EF and Nikon F mount SLR cameras.\n\nFilm\n\nThe company produces several kinds of 35 mm, 120 and 110 film.\n\nPublication\n\n*Holga: the World Through a Plastic Lens.
