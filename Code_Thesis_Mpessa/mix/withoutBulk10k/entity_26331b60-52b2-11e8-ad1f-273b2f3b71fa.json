  "textBody" : "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center in Pasadena, California, United States, with large portions of the campus in La Cañada Flintridge, California.\n\nThe JPL is owned by NASA and managed by the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for NASA. The laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.\n\nAmong the laboratory's major active projects are the Mars Science Laboratory mission (which includes the Curiosity rover), the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Dawn mission to the dwarf planet Ceres and asteroid Vesta, the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, the NuSTAR X-ray telescope, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. It is also responsible for managing the JPL Small-Body Database, and provides physical data and lists of publications for all known small Solar System bodies.\n\nThe JPL's Space Flight Operations Facility and Twenty-Five-Foot Space Simulator are designated National Historic Landmarks.\n\nHistory\n\nJPL traces its beginnings to 1936 in the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the Arroyo Seco.  Caltech graduate students Frank Malina, Qian Xuesen, Weld Arnold, and Apollo M. O. Smith, along with Jack Parsons and Edward S. Forman, tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina's graduate thesis.  Malina's thesis advisor was engineer/aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, who eventually arranged for U.S. Army financial support for this \"GALCIT Rocket Project\" in 1939. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, Martin Summerfield, and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rockets to the Army. In 1943, von Kármán, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO rockets. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university.\n\nDuring JPL's Army years, the laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems, the MGM-5 Corporal and MGM-29 Sergeant intermediate range ballistic missiles. These missiles were the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL. It also developed a number of other weapons system prototypes, such as the Loki anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the Aerobee sounding rocket.  At various times, it carried out rocket testing at the White Sands Proving Ground, Edwards Air Force Base, and Goldstone, California. A lunar lander was also developed in 1938-39 which influenced design of the Apollo Lunar Module in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1954, JPL teamed up with Wernher von Braun's engineers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to propose orbiting a satellite during the International Geophysical Year. The team lost that proposal to Project Vanguard, and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a Jupiter-C rocket. They carried out three successful sub-orbital flights in 1956 and 1957. Using a spare Juno I (a modified Jupiter-C with a fourth stage), the two organizations then launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. \n\nJPL was transferred to NASA in December 1958, becoming the agency's primary planetary spacecraft center.  JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that prepared the way for Apollo. JPL also led the way in interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury. In 1998, JPL opened the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA. As of 2013, it has found 95% of asteroids that are a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth's orbit.\n\nJPL was early to employ female mathematicians. In the 1940s and 1950s, using mechanical calculators, women in an all-female computations group performed trajectory calculations.[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=1327 Women Made Early Inroads at JPL - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]. Jpl.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.[http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/women_chron/1.html ]  In 1961, JPL hired Dana Ulery as the first female engineer to work alongside male engineers as part of the Ranger and Mariner mission tracking teams.http://pub-lib.jpl.nasa.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-697/Bibliography39-03_1961-1962.pdf\n\nJPL has been recognized four times by the Space Foundation: with the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award, which is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs, in 1998; and with the John L. \"Jack\" Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration on three occasions – in 2009 (as part of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander Team[http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/the-phoenix-mars-lander-team-wins-2009-jack-swigert-award-for-space-exploration ] ), 2006 and 2005.\n\nLocation\n\nWhen it was founded, JPL's site was immediately west of a rocky flood-plain – the Arroyo Seco riverbed – above the Devil's Gate dam in the northwestern panhandle of the city of Pasadena. While the first few buildings were constructed in land bought from the city of Pasadena, subsequent buildings were constructed in neighboring unincorporated land that later became part of La Cañada Flintridge. Nowadays, most of the 177 acre of the U.S. federal government-owned NASA property that makes up the JPL campus is located in La Cañada Flintridge.[https://unitelcf.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/la-canada-flintridge_lafco-map-spere-of-influence.pdf]. Local Agency Formation Commission for the County of Los Angeles[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/readers/2012/08/jpl-mars-curiosity-la-canada-flintridge.html] Location of NASA's JPL is a bit of a curiosity Despite this, JPL still uses a Pasadena address (4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109) as its official mailing address. The city of La Cañada Flintridge was incorporated in 1976, well after JPL attained international recognition as a Pasadena institution.\n\nThere has been occasional rivalry between the two cities over the issue of which one should be mentioned in the media as the home of the laboratory.\n\nEmployees\n\nThere are approximately 6,000 full-time Caltech employees, and typically a few thousand additional contractors working on any given day. NASA also has a resident office at the facility staffed by federal managers who oversee JPL's activities and work for NASA. There are also some Caltech graduate students, college student interns and co-op students.\n\nEducation\n\nThe JPL Education Office serves educators and students by providing them with activities, resources, materials and opportunities tied to NASA missions and science. The mission of its programs is to introduce and further students' interest in pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers.\n\nInternships and fellowships\n\nJPL offers research, internship and fellowship opportunities in the summer and throughout the year to high school through postdoctoral and faculty students. (In most cases, students must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to apply, although foreign nationals studying at U.S. universities are eligible for limited programs.) Interns are sponsored through NASA programs, university partnerships and JPL mentors for research opportunities at the laboratory in areas including technology, robotics, planetary science, aerospace engineering, and astrophysics.\n\nIn August 2013, JPL was named one of \"The 10 Most Awesome College Labs of 2013\" by Popular Science, which noted that about 100 students who intern at the laboratory are considered for permanent jobs at JPL after they graduate.\n\nThe JPL Education Office also hosts the Planetary Science Summer School (PSSS), an annual week-long workshop for graduate and postdoctoral students. The program involves a one-week team design exercise developing an early mission concept study, working with JPL's Advanced Projects Design Team (\"Team X\") and other concurrent engineering teams.\n\nMuseum Alliance\n\nJPL created the NASA Museum Alliance in 2003 out of a desire to provide museums, planetariums, visitor centers and other kinds of informal educators with exhibit materials, professional development and information related to the upcoming landing of the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The Alliance now has more than 500 members, who get access to NASA displays, models, educational workshops and networking opportunities through the program. Staff at educational organizations that meet the Museum Alliance requirements can register to participate online.\n\nThe Museum Alliance is a subset of the JPL Education Office's Informal Education group, which also serves after-school and summer programs, parents and other kinds of informal educators.\n\nEducator Resource Center\n\nThe NASA/JPL Educator Resource Center, which is moving from its location at the Indian Hill Mall in Pomona, Calif. at the end of 2013, offers resources, materials and free workshops for formal and informal educators covering science, technology, engineering and science topics related to NASA missions and science.\n\nOpen house\n\nThe lab has an open house once a year on a Saturday and Sunday in May or June, when the public is invited to tour the facilities and see live demonstrations of JPL science and technology.  More limited private tours are also available throughout the year if scheduled well in advance.  Thousands of schoolchildren from Southern California and elsewhere visit the lab every year.  Due to federal spending cuts mandated by budget sequestration, the open house has been previously cancelled.  JPL open house for 2014 was October 11 and 12 and 2015 was October 10 and 11.  Starting from 2016, JPL replaced annual Open House with \"Ticket to Explore JPL\", which features the same exhibits but requires tickets and advance reservation.[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/events/2016/4/25/ticket-to-explore-jpl/ Ticket to Explore JPL Public Events]\n\nOther works\n\nIn addition to its government work, JPL has also assisted the nearby motion picture and television industries, by advising them about scientific accuracy in their productions. Science fiction shows advised by JPL include Babylon 5 and its sequel series, Crusade.\n\nJPL also works with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHSSTD). JPL and DHSSTD developed a search and rescue tool for first responders called FINDER. First responders can use FINDER to locate people still alive who are buried in rubble after a disaster or terrorist attack. FINDER uses microwave radar to detect breathing and pulses.Cohen, Bryan.

February 10, 2014 (Retrieved 02-10-2014).\n\nFunding\n\nJPL is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from NASA. In fiscal year 2012, the laboratory's budget was slightly under $1.5 billion, with the largest share going to Earth Science and Technology development.\n\nPeanuts tradition\n\nThere is a tradition at JPL to eat \"good luck peanuts\" before critical mission events, such as orbital insertions or landings. As the story goes, after the Ranger program had experienced failure after failure during the 1960s, the first successful Ranger mission to impact the Moon occurred after a JPL staff member had decided to pass out peanuts to relieve tension. The staff jokingly decided that the peanuts must have been a good luck charm, and the tradition persisted.\n\nMissions\n\nThese are some of the missions partially sponsored by JPL:\n* Explorer program\n* Ranger program\n* Surveyor program\n* Mariner program\n* Pioneer 3 & 4\n* Viking program\n* Voyager program\n* Magellan probe\n* Galileo probe\n* Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2\n* Deep Space 1 & 2\n* Mars Global Surveyor\n* Mars Climate Orbiter\n* Cassini–Huygens\n* Stardust\n* Mars Odyssey\n* Mars Pathfinder\n* Mars Exploration Rover Mission\n* Spitzer Space Telescope\n* Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\n* Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)\n* CloudSat\n* Phoenix (spacecraft)\n* Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM/Jason-2)\n* Orbiting Carbon Observatory\n* Mars Science Laboratory\n* Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n* Shuttle Radar Topography Mission\n\nList of directors\n\n* Theodore von Kármán, 1938 – 1944\n* Frank Malina, 1944 – 1946\n* Louis Dunn, 1946 – October 1, 1954\n* William Hayward Pickering, October 1, 1954 – March 31, 1976\n* Bruce C.

HSPD12 JPL. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. This was followed by Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS 201), which specified how the federal government should implement personal identity verification. These specifications led to a need for rebadging to meet the updated requirements.\n\nOn August 30, 2007, a group of JPL employees filed suit in federal court against NASA, Caltech, and the Department of Commerce, claiming their constitutional rights were being violated by the new, overly invasive background investigations.[http://hspd12jpl.org Overview]. HSPD12 JPL. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. 97% of JPL employees were classified at the low-risk level and would be subjected to the same clearance procedures as those obtaining moderate/high risk clearance. Under HSPD 12 and FIPS 201, investigators have the right to obtain any information on employees, which includes questioning acquaintances on the status of the employee's mental, emotional, and financial stability. Additionally, if employees depart JPL before the end of the two-year validity of the background check, no investigation ability is terminated; former employees can still be legally monitored.\n\nEmployees were told that if they did not sign an unlimited waiver of privacy,  they would be deemed to have \"voluntarily resigned\". The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the process violated the employees' privacy rights and issued a preliminary injunction. NASA appealed and the US Supreme Court granted certiorari on March 8, 2010. On January 19, 2011, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth Circuit decision, ruling that the background checks did not violate any constitutional privacy right that the employees may have had.\n\nCoppedge v Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nOn March 12, 2012, the Los Angeles Superior Court took opening statements on the case in which former JPL employee David Coppedge brought suit against the lab due to workplace discrimination and wrongful termination. In the suit, Coppedge alleges that he first lost his \"team lead\" status on JPL's Cassini-Huygens mission in 2009 and then was fired in 2011 because of his evangelical Christian beliefs and specifically his belief in intelligent design. Conversely, JPL, through the Caltech lawyers representing the laboratory, allege that Coppedge's termination was simply due to budget cuts and his demotion from team lead was because of harassment complaints and from on-going conflicts with his co-workers. Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige issued a final ruling in favor of JPL on January 16, 2013.",

In the suit, Coppedge alleges that he first lost his \"team lead\" status on JPL's Cassini-Huygens mission in 2009 and then was fired in 2011 because of his evangelical Christian beliefs and specifically his belief in intelligent design. Conversely, JPL, through the Caltech lawyers representing the laboratory, allege that Coppedge's termination was simply due to budget cuts and his demotion from team lead was because of harassment complaints and from on-going conflicts with his co-workers. Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige issued a final ruling in favor of JPL on January 16, 2013. Jet Propulsion Laboratory. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=16459."
