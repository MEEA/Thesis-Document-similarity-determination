  "textBody" : "In algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). The word homomorphism comes from the ancient Greek language: ὁμός (homos) meaning \"same\" and μορφή (morphe) meaning \"form\" or \"shape\". However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German ähnlich meaning \"similar\" to ὁμός meaning \"same\".https://mathoverflow.net/questions/280261/whence-homomorphism-and-homomorphic/280271#280271\n\nHomomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps, and their study is the object of linear algebra.\n\nThe concept of homomorphism has been generalized, under the name of morphism, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic. This generalization is the starting point of category theory.\n\nA homomorphism may also be an isomorphism, an endomorphism, an automorphism, etc. (see below). Each of those can be defined in a way that may be generalized to any class of morphisms.\n\nDefinition \n\nA homomorphism is a map between two algebraic structures of the same type (that is of the same name), that preserves the operations of the structures. This means a map f: A\\to B between two sets ,  equipped with the same structure such that, if  is an operation of the structure (supposed here, for simplification, to be a binary operation), then\nf(x*y)=f(x)*f(y)\nfor every pair  of elements of .As it is often the case, but not always, the same symbol for the operation of both  and  was used here. One says often that  preserves the operation or is compatible with the operation.\n\nFormally, a map f: A\\to B preserves an operation  of arity , defined on both  and  if \nf(\\mu_A(a_1, \\ldots, a_k)) = \\mu_B(f(a_1), \\ldots, f(a_k)), \nfor all elements  in .\n\nFor example:\n\n* A semigroup homomorphism is a map between semigroups that preserves the semigroup operation.\n* A monoid homomorphism is a map between monoids that preserves the monoid operation and maps the identity element of the first monoid to that of the second monoid (the identity element is a 0-ary operation).\n* A group homomorphism is a map between groups that preserves the group operation. This implies that the group homomorphism maps the identity element of the first group to the identity element of the second group, and maps the inverse of an element of the first group  to the inverse of the image of this element. Thus a semigroup homomorphism between groups is necessarily a group homomorphism.\n* A ring homomorphism is a map between rings that preserves the ring addition, the ring multiplication, and the multiplicative identity. Whether the multiplicative identity is to be preserved depends upon the definition of ring in use. If the multiplicative identity is not preserved, one has a rng homomorphism.\n* A linear map is a homomorphism of vector space, That is a group homomorphism between vector spaces that preserves the abelian group structure and scalar multiplication.\n* A module homomorphism, also called a linear map between modules, is defined similarly.\n* An algebra homomorphism is a map that preserves the algebra operations.\n\nAn algebraic structure may have more than one operation, and a homomorphism is required to preserve each operation. Thus a map that preserves only some of the operations is not a homomorphism of the structure, but only a homomorphism of the substructure obtained by considering only the preserved operations. For example, a map between monoids that preserves the monoid operation and not the identity element, is not a monoid homomorphism, but only a semigroup homomorphism.\n\nThe notation for the operations does not need to be the same in the source and the target of a homomorphism. For example, the real numbers form a group for addition, and the positive real numbers form a group for multiplication. The exponential function \nx\\mapsto e^x\nsatisfies\ne^{x+y} = e^xe^y,\nand is thus a homomorphism between these two groups. It is even an isomorphism (see below), as its inverse function, the natural logarithm, satisfies \n\\ln(xy)=\\ln(x)+\\ln(y), \nand is also a group homomorphism.\n\nExamples \n\nThe real numbers are a ring, having both addition and multiplication.  The set of all 2 × 2 matrices is also a ring, under matrix addition and matrix multiplication.  If we define a function between these rings as follows:\nf(r) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix}\nwhere  is a real number, then  is a homomorphism of rings, since  preserves both addition:\nf(r+s) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  r+s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r+s\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & s\n\\end{pmatrix} = f(r) + f(s)\nand multiplication:\nf(rs) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  rs & 0 \\\\\n   0 & rs\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   r & 0 \\\\\n   0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s & 0 \\\\\n   0 & s\n\\end{pmatrix} = f(r)\\,f(s).\n\nFor another example, the nonzero complex numbers form a group under the operation of multiplication, as do the nonzero real numbers.  (Zero must be excluded from both groups since it does not have a multiplicative inverse, which is required for elements of a group.)  Define a function  from the nonzero complex numbers to the nonzero real numbers by\nf(z) = |z| .\nThat is,  is the absolute value (or modulus) of the complex number .  Then  is a homomorphism of groups, since it preserves multiplication:\nf(z_1 z_2) |z_1 z_2| \n |z_1| |z_2| = f(z_1) f(z_2) .\nNote that  cannot be extended to a homomorphism of rings (from the complex numbers to the real numbers), since it does not preserve addition:\n|z_1 + z_2| \\ne |z_1| + |z_2| .\n\nAs another example, the diagram shows a monoid homomorphism  from the monoid  to the monoid . Due to the different names of corresponding operations, the structure preservation properties satisfied by  amount to  and .\n\nA composition algebra  over a field  has a quadratic form, called a norm, , which is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of  to the multiplicative group of .\n\nSpecial homomorphisms \n\nSeveral kinds of homomorphisms have a specific name, which is also defined for general morphisms.\n\nIsomorphism \n\nAn isomorphism between algebraic structures of the same type is commonly defined as a bijective homomorphism. \n\nIn the more general context of category theory, an isomorphism is defined as a morphism, which has an inverse that is also a morphism. In the specific case of algebraic structures, the two definitions are equivalent, although they may differ for non-algebraic structures, which have an underlying set.\n\nMore precisely, if \nf: A\\to B\nis a (homo)morphism, it has an inverse if there exists a homomorphism\ng: B\\to A\nsuch that\nf\\circ g \\operatorname{Id}_B \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad g\\circ f \n \\operatorname{Id}_A.\n\nIf  and  have underlying sets, and f: A\\to B has an inverse , then  is bijective. In fact,  is injective, as  implies , and   is surjective, as, for any  in , one has  , and  is the image of an element of .\n\nConversely, if f: A\\to B is a bijective homomorphism between algebraic structures, let g: B\\to A be the map such that  is the unique element  of  such that . One has f\\circ g \\operatorname{Id}_B \\text{ and } g\\circ f \n \\operatorname{Id}_A, and it remains only to show that  is a homomorphism. If * is a binary operation of the structure, for every pair  of elements of , one has\ng(x*_B y) g(f(g(x))*_Bf(g(y))) \n g(f(g(x)*_A g(y))) = g(x)*_A g(y),\nand  is thus compatible with *. As the proof is similar for any arity, this shows that  is a homomorphism.\n\nThis proof does not work for non-algebraic structures. For examples, for topological spaces, a morphism is a continuous map, and the inverse of a bijective continuous map needs not to be continuous. An isomorphism of topological spaces, called homeomorphism or bicontinuous map, is thus a bijective continuous map, whose inverse is also continuous.\n\nEndomorphism\n\nAn endomorphism is a homomorphism whose domain equals the codomain, or, more generally, a morphism whose source is equal to the target.\n\nThe endomorphisms of an algebraic structure, or of an object of a category form a monoid under composition.\n\nThe endomorphisms of a vector space or of a module form a ring. In the case of a vector space or a free module of finite dimension, the choice of a basis induces a ring isomorphism between the ring of endomorphisms and the ring of square matrices of the same dimension.\n\nAutomorphism\n\nAn automorphism is an endomorphism that is also an isomorphism.\n\nThe automorphisms of an algebraic structure or of an object of a category form a group under composition, which is called the automorphism group of the structure.\n\nMany groups that have received a name are automorphism groups of some algebraic structure. For example, the general linear group \\operatorname{GL}_n(k) is the automorphism group of a vector space of dimension  over a field .\n\nThe automorphism groups of fields were introduced by Évariste Galois for studying the roots of polynomials, and are the basis of Galois theory.\n\nMonomorphism\n\nFor algebraic structures, monomorphisms are commonly defined as injective homomorphisms. \n\nIn the more general context of category theory, a monomorphism is defined as a homomorphism that is left cancelable. This means that a (homo)morphism f:A\\to B is a monomorphism if, for any pair  of morphisms from any other object  to , then f\\circ g \n f\\circ h implies .\n\nThese two definitions of monomorphism are equivalent for all common algebraic structures. More precisely, they are equivalent for fields, for which every homomorphism is a monomorphism, and for varieties of universal algebra, that is algebraic structures for which operations and axioms (identities) are defined without any restriction (fields are not a variety, as the multiplicative inverse is defined either as a unary operation or as a property of the multiplication, which are, in both cases, defined only for nonzero elements).\n\nIn particular, the two definitions of a monomorphism are equivalent for sets, magmas, semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and modules.\n\nA split monomorphism is a homomorphism that has a right inverse. That is, a homomorphism f\\colon A \\to B is a split homomorphism if there exists a homomorphism g\\colon B \\to A such that g\\circ f = \\operatorname{Id}_A. A split monomorphism is always a monomorphism, for both meanings of monomorphism. For sets and vector spaces, every monomorphism is a split homomorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.\n\nAn injective homomorphism is left cancelable: If f\\circ g f\\circ h, one has f(g(x))\nf(h(x)) for every  in , the common source of  and . If  is injective, then , and thus . This proof works not only for algebraic structures, but also for any category whose objects are sets and arrows are maps between these sets. For example, an injective continuous map is a monomorphism in the category of topological spaces.\n\nFor proving that, conversely, a left cancelable homomorphism is injective, it is useful to consider a free object on . Given a variety of algebraic structures a free object on  is a pair consisting of an algebraic structure  of this variety and an element  of  satisfying the following universal property: for every structure  of the variety, and every element  of , there is a unique homomorphism f: L\\to S such that . For example, for sets, the free object on  is simply ; for semigroups, the free object on  is \\{x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a semigroup, is isomorphic to the additive semigroup of the positive integers; for monoids, the free object on  is \\{1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a monoid, is isomorphic to the additive monoid of the nonnegative integers; for groups, the free object on  is the infinite cyclic group \\{\\ldots, x^{-n}, \\ldots, x^{-1}, 1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a group, is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers; for rings, the free object on  is the polynomial ring \\Bbb{Z}[x]; for vector spaces or modules, the free object on  is the vector space or free module that has  as a basis.\n\nIf a free object over  exists, then every left cancelable homomorphism is injective: let f\\colon A \\to B be a left cancelable homomorphism, and  and  be two elements of  such . By definition of the free object , there exist homomorphisms  and  from  to  such that  and . As , one has f\\circ g = f\\circ h,  by the uniqueness in the definition of a universal property. As  is left cancelable, one has , and thus . Therefore,  is injective.\n\nExistence of a free object on  for a variety (see also ): For building a free object over , let us consider the set  of the well-formed formulas built up from  and the operations of the structure. Two such formulas are said equivalent if one may pass from one to the other by applying the axioms (identities of the structure). This defines an equivalence relation, if the identities are not subject to conditions, that is if one works with a variety. Then the operations of the variety are well defined on the set of equivalence classes of  for this relation. It is straightforward to show that the resulting object is a free object on .\n\nEpimorphism\n\nIn algebra, epimorphisms are often defined as surjective homomorphisms. On the other hand, in category theory, epimorphisms are defined as right cancelable. This means that a (homo)morphism f:A\\to B is an epimorphism if, for any pair  of morphisms from  to any other object , the equality g\\circ f \n h\\circ f implies .\n\nA surjective homomorphism is always right cancelable, but the converse is not always true for algebraic structures. However, the two definitions of epimorphism are equivalent for sets, vector spaces, abelian groups and modules. The importance of these structures in all mathematics, and specially in linear algebra and homological algebra, may explain the coexistence of two non-equivalent definitions.\n\nThe most basic example of an epimorphism (category theory meaning), which is not surjective, is the ring inclusion of Z in Q.  This is also an example of a ring homomorphism which is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism, but not an isomorphism.\n\nA wide generalization of this example is the localization of a ring by a multiplicative set. Every localization is a ring epimorphism, which is not, in general, surjective. As localizations are fundamental in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, this may explain why in these areas, the definition of epimorphisms as right cancelable homomorphisms is generally preferred.\n\nA split epimorphism is a homomorphism that has a left inverse. That is, a homomorphism f\\colon A \\to B is a split epimorphism if there exists a homomorphism g\\colon B \\to A such that f\\circ g = \\operatorname{Id}_B. A split epimorphism is always an epimorphism, for both meanings of epimorphism. For sets and vector spaces, every epimorphism is a split epimorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.\n\nIn summary, one has \n\\text {split epimorphism} \\implies \\text{epimorphism (surjective)}\\implies \\text {epimorphism (right cancelable)}; \nthe last implication is an equivalence for sets, vector spaces, modules and abelian groups; the first implication is an equivalence for sets and vector spaces.\n\nLet f\\colon A \\to B be a homomorphism. We want to prove that if it is not surjective, it is not right cancelable.\n\nIn the case of sets, let  be an element of  that not belongs to , and define g,h\\colon B\\to B such that  is the identity function, and that  for every x\\in B, except that  is any other element of . Clearly  is not right cancelable, as  and g\\circ f = h\\circ f.\n\nIn the case of vector spaces, abelian groups and modules, the proof relies on the existence of cokernels and on the fact that the zero maps are homomorphisms: let  be the cokernel of , and g\\colon B\\to C be the canonical map, such that . Let hk\\circ g where  is the zero map from  to . If  is not surjective, , and thus  (one is a zero map, while the other is not). Thus  is not cancelable, as g\\circ f \n h\\circ f (both are the zero map from  to ).\n\nKernel \n\nAny homomorphism  defines an equivalence relation  on  by  if and only if . The relation  is called the kernel of . It is a congruence relation on . The quotient set  can then be given a structure of the same type, in a natural way, by defining the operations as . In that case the image of  in  under the homomorphism  is necessarily isomorphic to ; this fact is one of the isomorphism theorems.\n\nWhen the algebraic structure is a  group for some operation, the equivalence class  of the identity element of this operation suffices to characterize the equivalence relation. In this case, the quotient by the equivalence relation is denoted by  (usually read as \" mod \"). Also in this case, it is , rather than , that is called the kernel of . The kernels of homomorphisms of a given type of algebraic structure are naturally equipped with some structure. This structure type of the kernels is the same as the considered structure, in the case of abelian groups, vector spaces and modules, but is different and has received a specific name in other cases, such as normal subgroup for kernels of group homomorphisms and ideals for kernels of ring homomorphisms (in the case of non-commutative rings, the kernels are the two-sided ideals).\n\nRelational structures \n\nIn model theory, the notion of an algebraic structure is generalized to structures involving both operations and relations. Let L be a signature consisting of function and relation symbols, and A, B be two L-structures. Then a homomorphism from A to B is a mapping h from the domain of A to the domain of B such that\n* h(FA(a1,…,an)) = FB(h(a1),…,h(an)) for each n-ary function symbol F in L,\n* RA(a1,…,an) implies RB(h(a1),…,h(an)) for each n-ary relation symbol R in L.\nIn the special case with just one binary relation, we obtain the notion of a graph homomorphism. For a detailed discussion of relational homomorphisms and isomorphisms see.Section 17.4, in Gunther Schmidt, 2010. Relational Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, \n\nFormal language theory\n\nHomomorphisms are also used in the study of formal languagesSeymour Ginsburg, Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages, North-Holland, 1975, , and are often briefly referred to as morphisms.T. Harju, J. Karhumӓki, Morphisms in Handbook of Formal Languages, Volume I, edited by G. Rozenberg, A. Salomaa, Springer, 1997, . Given alphabets Σ1 and Σ2, a function  such that  for all u and v in Σ1∗ is called a homomorphism on Σ1∗.The ∗ denotes the Kleene star operation, while Σ∗ denotes the set of words formed from the alphabet Σ, including the empty word. Juxtaposition of terms denotes concatenation. For example, h(u) h(v) denotes the concatenation of h(u) with h(v). If h is a homomorphism on Σ1∗ and e denotes the empty word, then h is called an e-free homomorphism when  for all  in Σ1∗.\n\nThe set Σ∗ of words formed from the alphabet Σ may be thought of as the free monoid generated by Σ. Here the monoid operation is concatenation and the identity element is the empty word. From this perspective, a language homormorphism is precisely a monoid homomorphism.We are assured that a language homomorphism h maps the empty word e to the empty word. Since h(e) \n h(ee) h(e)h(e), the number w of characters in h(e) equals the number 2w of characters in h(e)h(e). Hence w \n 0 and h(e) has null length.",

If  is injective, then , and thus . This proof works not only for algebraic structures, but also for any category whose objects are sets and arrows are maps between these sets. For example, an injective continuous map is a monomorphism in the category of topological spaces.\n\nFor proving that, conversely, a left cancelable homomorphism is injective, it is useful to consider a free object on . Given a variety of algebraic structures a free object on  is a pair consisting of an algebraic structure  of this variety and an element  of  satisfying the following universal property: for every structure  of the variety, and every element  of , there is a unique homomorphism f: L\\to S such that . For example, for sets, the free object on  is simply ; for semigroups, the free object on  is \\{x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a semigroup, is isomorphic to the additive semigroup of the positive integers; for monoids, the free object on  is \\{1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a monoid, is isomorphic to the additive monoid of the nonnegative integers; for groups, the free object on  is the infinite cyclic group \\{\\ldots, x^{-n}, \\ldots, x^{-1}, 1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n, \\ldots\\}, which, as, a group, is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers; for rings, the free object on  is the polynomial ring \\Bbb{Z}[x]; for vector spaces or modules, the free object on  is the vector space or free module that has  as a basis.\n\nIf a free object over  exists, then every left cancelable homomorphism is injective: let f\\colon A \\to B be a left cancelable homomorphism, and  and  be two elements of  such . By definition of the free object , there exist homomorphisms  and  from  to  such that  and . As , one has f\\circ g = f\\circ h,  by the uniqueness in the definition of a universal property. As  is left cancelable, one has , and thus . Therefore,  is injective.\n\nExistence of a free object on  for a variety (see also ): For building a free object over , let us consider the set  of the well-formed formulas built up from  and the operations of the structure. Two such formulas are said equivalent if one may pass from one to the other by applying the axioms (identities of the structure). This defines an equivalence relation, if the identities are not subject to conditions, that is if one works with a variety. Then the operations of the variety are well defined on the set of equivalence classes of  for this relation. It is straightforward to show that the resulting object is a free object on .\n\nEpimorphism\n\nIn algebra, epimorphisms are often defined as surjective homomorphisms. On the other hand, in category theory, epimorphisms are defined as right cancelable. This means that a (homo)morphism f:A\\to B is an epimorphism if, for any pair  of morphisms from  to any other object , the equality g\\circ f \n h\\circ f implies .\n\nA surjective homomorphism is always right cancelable, but the converse is not always true for algebraic structures. However, the two definitions of epimorphism are equivalent for sets, vector spaces, abelian groups and modules. The importance of these structures in all mathematics, and specially in linear algebra and homological algebra, may explain the coexistence of two non-equivalent definitions.\n\nThe most basic example of an epimorphism (category theory meaning), which is not surjective, is the ring inclusion of Z in Q.  This is also an example of a ring homomorphism which is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism, but not an isomorphism.\n\nA wide generalization of this example is the localization of a ring by a multiplicative set. Every localization is a ring epimorphism, which is not, in general, surjective. As localizations are fundamental in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, this may explain why in these areas, the definition of epimorphisms as right cancelable homomorphisms is generally preferred.\n\nA split epimorphism is a homomorphism that has a left inverse. That is, a homomorphism f\\colon A \\to B is a split epimorphism if there exists a homomorphism g\\colon B \\to A such that f\\circ g = \\operatorname{Id}_B. A split epimorphism is always an epimorphism, for both meanings of epimorphism. For sets and vector spaces, every epimorphism is a split epimorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.\n\nIn summary, one has \n\\text {split epimorphism} \\implies \\text{epimorphism (surjective)}\\implies \\text {epimorphism (right cancelable)}; \nthe last implication is an equivalence for sets, vector spaces, modules and abelian groups; the first implication is an equivalence for sets and vector spaces.\n\nLet f\\colon A \\to B be a homomorphism. We want to prove that if it is not surjective, it is not right cancelable.\n\nIn the case of sets, let  be an element of  that not belongs to , and define g,h\\colon B\\to B such that  is the identity function, and that  for every x\\in B, except that  is any other element of . Clearly  is not right cancelable, as  and g\\circ f = h\\circ f.\n\nIn the case of vector spaces, abelian groups and modules, the proof relies on the existence of cokernels and on the fact that the zero maps are homomorphisms: let  be the cokernel of , and g\\colon B\\to C be the canonical map, such that . Let hk\\circ g where  is the zero map from  to . If  is not surjective, , and thus  (one is a zero map, while the other is not). Thus  is not cancelable, as g\\circ f \n h\\circ f (both are the zero map from  to ).\n\nKernel \n\nAny homomorphism  defines an equivalence relation  on  by  if and only if . The relation  is called the kernel of . It is a congruence relation on . The quotient set  can then be given a structure of the same type, in a natural way, by defining the operations as . In that case the image of  in  under the homomorphism  is necessarily isomorphic to ; this fact is one of the isomorphism theorems.\n\nWhen the algebraic structure is a  group for some operation, the equivalence class  of the identity element of this operation suffices to characterize the equivalence relation. In this case, the quotient by the equivalence relation is denoted by  (usually read as \" mod \"). Also in this case, it is , rather than , that is called the kernel of . The kernels of homomorphisms of a given type of algebraic structure are naturally equipped with some structure. This structure type of the kernels is the same as the considered structure, in the case of abelian groups, vector spaces and modules, but is different and has received a specific name in other cases, such as normal subgroup for kernels of group homomorphisms and ideals for kernels of ring homomorphisms (in the case of non-commutative rings, the kernels are the two-sided ideals).\n\nRelational structures \n\nIn model theory, the notion of an algebraic structure is generalized to structures involving both operations and relations. Let L be a signature consisting of function and relation symbols, and A, B be two L-structures. Then a homomorphism from A to B is a mapping h from the domain of A to the domain of B such that\n* h(FA(a1,…,an)) = FB(h(a1),…,h(an)) for each n-ary function symbol F in L,\n* RA(a1,…,an) implies RB(h(a1),…,h(an)) for each n-ary relation symbol R in L.\nIn the special case with just one binary relation, we obtain the notion of a graph homomorphism. For a detailed discussion of relational homomorphisms and isomorphisms see.Section 17.4, in Gunther Schmidt, 2010. Relational Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, \n\nFormal language theory\n\nHomomorphisms are also used in the study of formal languagesSeymour Ginsburg, Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages, North-Holland, 1975, , and are often briefly referred to as morphisms.T. Harju, J. Karhumӓki, Morphisms in Handbook of Formal Languages, Volume I, edited by G. Rozenberg, A. Salomaa, Springer, 1997, . Given alphabets Σ1 and Σ2, a function  such that  for all u and v in Σ1∗ is called a homomorphism on Σ1∗.The ∗ denotes the Kleene star operation, while Σ∗ denotes the set of words formed from the alphabet Σ, including the empty word. Juxtaposition of terms denotes concatenation. For example, h(u) h(v) denotes the concatenation of h(u) with h(v). If h is a homomorphism on Σ1∗ and e denotes the empty word, then h is called an e-free homomorphism when  for all  in Σ1∗.\n\nThe set Σ∗ of words formed from the alphabet Σ may be thought of as the free monoid generated by Σ. Here the monoid operation is concatenation and the identity element is the empty word. From this perspective, a language homormorphism is precisely a monoid homomorphism.We are assured that a language homomorphism h maps the empty word e to the empty word. Since h(e) \n h(ee) h(e)h(e), the number w of characters in h(e) equals the number 2w of characters in h(e)h(e). Hence w \n 0 and h(e) has null length.
