  "textBody" : "Bundaberg Rum is a dark rum produced in Bundaberg, Australia. It is often referred to as \"Bundy\".\nThe Bundaberg Distilling Company owns its own cola-producing facility, which supplies the cola for its ready-to-drink Bundaberg Rum and Cola products.\n\nHistory\n\nBundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste molasses after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of ₤5,000.\n\nThe Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.\n\nBundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby Burnett River.\n\nIn 1961, the company introduced the polar bear as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.\n\nIn 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and distillery were sold to British company Diageo.\n\nIn 2014, a decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's iconic drink, \"Bundaberg Rum\", to the western Sydney suburb of Huntingwood resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name. The decision drew criticism from all levels of Queensland politics:\n* Premier Campbell Newman said it was a disappointing move, particularly in a region that had suffered devastating floods in recent years.\n* Bundaberg mayor Mal Forman said \"I'm saddened by the announcement, but I had been assured the company had a commitment to the city\".\n* Cr Forman said \"I understood demand for bottled Bundaberg Rum had declined as more people bought pre-mixed cans, a trend I wanted no part of\".\n\nLater a Diageo spokeswoman clarified by saying \"Some premium products, such as the Master Distillers Collection, would continue to be bottled in Bundaberg. This was not a decision we have taken lightly, however it is a necessary one to ensure the longer term sustainability of the distillery. We remain absolutely committed to Bundaberg and the distillery and will continue to invest and focus on our core business of distilling, maturing and blending great quality rum in Bundaberg as we have done for the last 125 years.\" \n\nDistillery\n\nThe Bundaberg Rum distillery is open to visitors for tours of the facility.  There is also a museum which offers free samples of Bundaberg Rum products for visitors in a historic Queenslander house. The Big Bundy Bottle is also outside of the bondstore. A new $8.5 million visitor centre opened to the public in August 2016 replacing the smaller historic house next door.http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/bundy-rum-opens-new-85-million-tourist-centre-in-b/3076595/#/0\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Bundaberg Rum Distillery was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"location\".\n\nVariant flavours\n\n* Bundaberg Rum UP 37% \n* Bundaberg Rum Original 100 Proof 50% \n* Bundaberg Rum Overproof 57.7% \n* Bundaberg Red 37% \n* Bundaberg Red 100 Proof 50% \n* Bundaberg Five 37% \n* Bundaberg Select Vat Aged 6 Years 37% \n* Bundaberg Mutiny Spiced Rum 37% \n* Master Distillers' Collection Small Batch 40% \n* Master Distillers' Collection Small Batch - Vintage Barrel 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection 280 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection Black Barrel - Distilled 2004 - Black Glass 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection Black Barrel - Distilled 2004 - Clear Glass 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection Black Barrel - Distilled 2005 - Clear Glass 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection Blenders Edition 2014 40% \n* Master Distillers Collection Blenders Edition 2015 40% \n* Bundaberg Tropics - Pineapple & Coconut 23.5% \n* Bundaberg Royal Liqueur Banana and Toffee 20% \n* Bundaberg Royal Liqueur Coffee and Chocolate 20% \n* Bundy Wings Heritage Label Original 37% \n\nSponsorship\n\nBundaberg Rum is a major sponsor of the Australian Wallabies rugby union team and also sponsors the Bundaberg Rum Rugby Series.

A series of advertisements featuring the Bundaberg Rum bear, a polar bear known as Bundy R. Bear, were produced by advertising agency Leo Burnett to align the product 'with a larrikin approach to Australian mateship'. The Bundaberg Rum bear first appeared in 1961. It was designed to soften rum's aggressive image and broaden its appeal from the traditional older male drinker to a more sociable audience. The advertisements have been cited as a favourite among Australia's youth.",
