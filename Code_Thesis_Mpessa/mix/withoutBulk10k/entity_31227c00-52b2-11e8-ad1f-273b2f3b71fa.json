In its narrowest sense it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands,. that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. \n\nThe term entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian Levante, meaning \"rising\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term Mashriq, meaning \"the land where the sun rises\". In the 13th and 14th centuries, the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean, including Greece, Anatolia, Syria-Palestine, and Egypt, that is, the lands east of Venice. Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt. In 1581, England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire. The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I. This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used synonymously with Syria-Palestine. Some scholars misunderstood the term thinking that it derives from the name of Lebanon. Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references. It has the same meaning as Syria-Palestine or the region of Syria (Arabic: الشام), that is, it means an area bounded by the Taurus Mountains of Turkey in the North, the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and the north Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia in the east. It does not include Anatolia (also called Asia Minor), the Caucasus Mountains or any part of the Arabian Peninsula proper. Cilicia (in Asia Minor) and the Sinai Peninsula (Asian Egypt) are sometimes included.\n\nThe term Levant was widely used to describe the region from the 18th to the mid-19th centuries, and has had steady but lower usage since the late 19th century;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?contentLevant%2CLevantine&year_start\n1950&year_end2008&corpus\n15&smoothing10 Google Ngram Viewer plot] several dictionaries consider it to be \"archaic\" today.LEVANT archaic The eastern part of the Mediterranean with the islands and neighbouring countries.

They are often referred to as Levantines.Orfalea, Gregory The Arab Americans: A History. Olive Branch Press. Northampton, MA, 2006. Page 249\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term Levant, which appeared in English in 1497, originally meant the East in general or \"Mediterranean lands east of Italy\". It is borrowed from the French levant \"rising\", referring to the rising of the sun in the east, or the point where the sun rises.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition The phrase is ultimately from the Latin word levare, meaning 'lift, raise'. Similar etymologies are found in Greek Ἀνατολή (Anatolē, cf. Anatolia), in Germanic Morgenland (literally, \"morning land\"), in Italian (as in \"Riviera di Levante\", the portion of the Liguria coast east of Genoa), in Hungarian Kelet, in Spanish and Catalan Levante and Llevant, (\"the place of rising\"), and in Hebrew (mizrah). Most notably, \"Orient\" and its Latin source oriens meaning \"east\", is literally \"rising\", deriving from Latin orior \"rise\".\n\nThe notion of the Levant has undergone a dynamic process of historical evolution in usage, meaning, and understanding. While the term \"Levantine\" originally referred to the European residents of the eastern Mediterranean region, it later came to refer to regional \"native\" and \"minority\" groups.\n\nThe term became current in English in the 16th century, along with the first English merchant adventurers in the region; English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 1570s, and the English merchant company signed its agreement (\"capitulations\") with the Ottoman Sultan in 1579.. The English Levant Company was founded in 1581 to trade with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1670 the French Compagnie du Levant was founded for the same purpose. At this time, the Far East was known as the \"Upper Levant\".\n\nIn early 19th-century travel writing, the term sometimes incorporated certain Mediterranean provinces of the Ottoman empire, as well as independent Greece (and especially the Greek islands). In 19th-century archaeology, it referred to overlapping cultures in this region during and after prehistoric times, intending to reference the place instead of any one culture. The French mandate of Syria and Lebanon (1920–1946) was called the Levant states.\n\nGeography and modern-day use of the term\n\nToday, \"Levant\" is the term typically used by archaeologists and historians with reference to the history of the region. Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to it being a \"wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus\" that does not have the \"political overtones\" of Syria-Palestine. The term is also used for modern events, peoples, states or parts of states in the same region,e.g., \"The Levant Crisis: Syria, Iraq, and the Region\", Australian National University [http://www.anu.edu.au/events/the-levant-crisis-syria-iraq-and-the-region]; Center for Strategic and International Studies, \"Egypt and the Levant\", 2017 [https://www.csis.org/programs/middle-east-program/regions/egypt-and-levant]; Michael Kerr, Craig Larkin, eds., The Alawis of Syria, 2015  namely Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey are sometimes considered Levant countries (compare with Near East, Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia). Several researchers include the island of Cyprus in Levantine studies, including the Council for British Research in the Levant, the UCLA Near Eastern Languages and Cultures department,[http://www.nelc.ucla.edu/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id70&Itemid\n98 Biblical and Levantine studies], UCLA Journal of Levantine Studies and the UCL Institute of Archaeology,[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/events/conferences/ancient-levant-2008/AncLevFINAL.doc. The Ancient Levant], UCL Institute of Archaeology, May 2008 the last of which has dated the connection between Cyprus and mainland Levant to the early Iron Age. Archaeologists seeking a neutral orientation that is neither biblical nor national have used terms such as Levantine archaeology and archaeology of the Southern Levant.Dever, William G. \"Syro-Palestinian and Biblical Archaeology\", pp. 1244-1253.Sharon, Ilan \"Biblical archaeology\" in Encyclopedia of Archaeology Elsevier.\n\nWhile the usage of the term \"Levant\" in academia has been restricted to the fields of archeology and literature, there is a recent attempt to reclaim the notion of the Levant as a category of analysis in political and social sciences. Two academic journals were recently launched: [http://www.levantine-journal.org Journal of Levantine Studies], published by the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute and The Levantine Review, published by Boston College.\n\nISIL has adopted the term \"Levant\" within the English translation of their self-designation.\n\nHistory \n\nPolitics and religion\n\nThe largest religious group in the Levant are the Muslims and the largest cultural-linguistic group are Arabs, due to the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century and subsequent Arabization of the region. Other large ethnic groups in the Levant include Jews, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians and Armenians.\n\nThe majority of Levantines are Sunni, Salafi, nondenominational or Shia Muslim. There are also Jews, Christians, Yazidi Kurds, Alawites, Nizari, Druze, and Ismailis.\n\nUntil the establishment of the modern State of Israel in 1948, Jews lived throughout the Levant alongside Muslims and Christians; since then, almost all have been expelled from their homes and sought refuge in Israel.\n\nThere are many Levantine Christian groups such as Greek and Oriental Orthodox Mainly Syriac Orthodox, Maronite, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. Armenians mostly belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are Levantines or Franco-Levantines who are mostly Roman Catholic. There are also Circassians, Turks, Samaritans, and Nawars. There are Assyrian peoples belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East (autonomous) and the Chaldean Catholic Church (Catholic).\n\nLanguage\n\nMost Levantine populations speak Levantine Arabic, also known as Mediterranean Arabic (, ). In Israel, the primary language is Hebrew; Arabic is an official language, and the Arab minority speaks a dialect of Levantine Arabic essentially indistinguishable from the forms spoken in the Palestinian territories. In Cyprus, the majority language is Greek, followed by Turkish, and then a dialect of Levantine Arabic, Cypriot Maronite Arabic. Some communities and populations speak Aramaic, Greek, Armenian, Circassian, French, or English.\n\nAugust Jochmus (freiherr von Cotignola)'s The Syrian War and the Decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1840-1848: In Reports, Documents, and Correspondences, Etc, Volume 1, published in 1883, stated that Italian was previously the most common western European language in the Levant, but that it was being replaced by French.Jochmus, August freiherr von Cotignola).
