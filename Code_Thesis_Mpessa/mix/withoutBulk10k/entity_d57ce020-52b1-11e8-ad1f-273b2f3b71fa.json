  "textBody" : "Chile's government is a representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Chile is both head of state and head of government, and of a formal multi-party system that in practice behaves like a two-party one, due to binomialism. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Congress. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature of Chile. The Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite in September 1980, under the military government of dictator Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet left power in 1988, saying this country was ready to keep going along with a plebiscite, the Constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life, granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years while also disabling immediate re-election. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Chile as \"flawed democracy\" in 2016.\n\nLegislative branch\n\nThe bicameral National Congress (Congreso Nacional) consists of the Senate (Senado) and the Chamber of Deputies (Cámara de Diputados).\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a unique binomial voting system that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can present two candidates for the two Senate and two lower-chamber seats apportioned to each chamber's electoral districts. Typically, the two largest coalitions split the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket outpolls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. The political parties with the largest representation in the current Chilean Congress are the centrist Christian Democrat Party and the conservative Independent Democratic Union (Unión Demócrata Independiente). The Communist Party and the small Humanist Party failed to gain any seats in the 1998 elections.\n\nElections are very labor-intensive but efficient, and vote counting normally takes place the evening of the election day. One voting table, with a ballot-box each, is set up for at-most 200 names in the voting registry. Each table is manned by five people (vocales de mesa) from the same registry. Vocales have the duty to work as such during a cycle of elections, and can be penalized legally if they do not show up. A registered citizen can only vote after his identity has been verified at the table corresponding to his registry. Ballots are manually counted by the five vocales, after the table has closed, at least eight hours after opening, and the counting witnessed by representatives of all the parties who choose to have observers.\n\nThe Senate is made up of 38 members elected from regions or subregions. Senators serve approximately eight-year terms.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies has 120 members, who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The last congressional elections were held on December 11, 2006. The next congressional elections are scheduled for December 2009.\n\nThe current Senate composition is as follows: 20 seats are held by the Coalition of Parties for Democracy (CPD): Six Christian Democrats (PDC), eight Socialists (PS), three Party for Democracy (PPD) and three Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD); 17 by the Alliance for Chile (APC): nine Independent Democratic Union (UDI) and eight National Renewal (RN); and one independent leaning right.\n\nThe current lower house—the Chamber of Deputies —contains 65 members of the governing coalition: 21 Christian Democrats (PDC), 15 Socialists (PS), 22 Party for Democracy (PPD) and seven Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD); 54 from the center-right Alliance for Chile(APC): 34 Independent Democratic Union (UDI) and 20 National Renewal (RN); and 1 from the Independent Regional Force (FRI) coalition: 1 Regionalist Action Party of Chile (PAR).\n\nSince 1987, the Congress operates in the port city of Valparaíso, about 110 kilometers (~70 mi.) northwest of the capital, Santiago. However some commissions are allowed to meet in other places, especially Santiago. Congressional members have tried repeatedly to relocate the Congress back to Santiago, where it operated until the Chilean Coup of 1973, but have not been successful. The last attempt was in 2000, when the project was rejected by the Constitutional Court, because it allocated funds from the national budget, which, under the Chilean Constitution, is a privilege of the President.\n\nLegal system\n\nChile's legal system is civil law based. It is primarily based on the Civil code of 1855, derived from Spanish law and subsequent codes influenced by European law of the last half of the 19th Century. It does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.\n\nFrom the year 2000 onward, Chile completely overhauled its criminal justice system; a new, US-style adversarial system has been gradually implemented throughout the country with the final stage of implementation in the Santiago metropolitan region completed on June 9, 2001\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\nPressure groups\n\nPressure groups according to the CIA World Factbook:\n* Student federations at all major universities\n* Roman Catholic Church\n* Workers' United Center of Chile trade unionists from Chile's five largest labor confederations.\n\nInternational organization participation\n\nChile or Chilean organizations participate in the following international organizations:\n\n* Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL)\n* Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\n* Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\n* Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\n* Group of 15 (G-15)\n* Group of 77 (G-77)\n* Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)\n* International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\n* International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank)\n* International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n* International Criminal Court (party since 2005)\n* International Chamber of Commerce\n* International Development Association (IDA)\n* International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)\n* International Finance Corporation (IFC)\n* International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRCS)\n* International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)\n* International Labour Organization (ILO)\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n* International Maritime Organization (IMO)\n* Interpol\n* International Olympic Committee (IOC)\n* International Organization for Migration (IOM)\n* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\n\n* International Red Cross\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)\n* Latin American Economic System (LAES)\n* Latin American Integration Association (LAIA)\n* Mercosur (associate)\n* Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)\n* Organization of American States (OAS)\n* Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)\n* Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)\n* Rio Group\n* Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)\n* United Nations (UN)\n** UN Conference on Trade & Development (UNCTAD)\n** United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\n** UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR)\n** UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)\n** UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)\n** UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)\n** UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO)\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n* World Customs Organization (WCO)\n* World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU)\n* World Health Organization (WHO)\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n* World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\n* World Tourism Organization (WToO)\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)",
