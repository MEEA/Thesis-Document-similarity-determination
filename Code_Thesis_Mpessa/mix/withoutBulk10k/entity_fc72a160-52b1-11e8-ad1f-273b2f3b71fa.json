  "textBody" : "In number theory, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem or the unique-prime-factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1Using the empty product rule one need not exclude the number 1, and the theorem can be stated as: every positive integer has unique prime factorization. either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers and that, moreover, this representation is unique, up to (except for) the order of the factors. For example,\n\n1200 2 × 3 × 5 \n 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 = ...\n\nThe theorem is stating two things: first, that 1200  be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.\n\nThe requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique (e.g., 12 2 × 6 \n 3 × 4).\n\nThis theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, \n\nEuclid's original version\n\nBook VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of Euclid's Elements are essentially the statement and proof of the fundamental theorem.\n\n(In modern terminology: if a  prime p divides the product ab, then p divides either a or b or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as Euclid's lemma.  And it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\n\n(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by infinite descent.\n\nProposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.\n\n(In modern terminology: a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and prove partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by André Weil.: \"Even in Euclid, we fail to find a general statement about the uniqueness of the factorization of an integer into primes; surely he may have been aware of it, but all he has is a statement (Eucl.IX.I4) about the l.c.m. of any number of given primes.\" Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.\n\nArticle 16 of Gauss' Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic.\n\nApplications\n\nCanonical representation of a positive integer\n \n\nEvery positive integer n > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers:\n\nn\n= p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2} \\cdots p_k^{n_k}\n\\prod_{i\n1}^{k} p_i^{n_i}\n\nwhere p1 2 k are primes and the ni are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to k = 0).\n\nThis representation is called the canonical representation of n, or the standard form of n.  For example,\n\n999 = 33×37,\n1000 = 23×53,\n1001 = 7×11×13.\n\nNote that factors p0 1 may be inserted without changing the value of n (e.g., 1000 \n 23×30×53).In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers:\n\nn2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}7^{n_4}\\cdots\n\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty p_i^{n_i},\n\nwhere a finite number of the ni are positive integers, and the rest are zero. Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive rational numbers.\n\nArithmetic operations\n\nThe canonical representations of the product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers a and b can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of a and b themselves:\n\\begin{alignat}{2}\n a\\cdot b &{}={} 2^{a_1+b_1}3^{a_2+b_2}5^{a_3+b_3}7^{a_4+b_4}\\cdots\n   &&{}={} \\prod p_i^{a_i+b_i},\\\\\n \\gcd(a,b) &{}={} 2^{\\min(a_1,b_1)}3^{\\min(a_2,b_2)}5^{\\min(a_3,b_3)}7^{\\min(a_4,b_4)}\\cdots\n   &&{}={} \\prod p_i^{\\min(a_i,b_i)},\\\\\n \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) &{}={} 2^{\\max(a_1,b_1)}3^{\\max(a_2,b_2)}5^{\\max(a_3,b_3)}7^{\\max(a_4,b_4)}\\cdots\n   &&{}={} \\prod p_i^{\\max(a_i,b_i)}.\n \\end{alignat}\n\nHowever, integer factorization, especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs.  So these formulas have limited use in practice.\n\nArithmetic functions\n\nMany arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of additive and multiplicative functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.\n\nProof\n\nThe proof uses Euclid's lemma (Elements VII, 30): if a prime p divides the product of two natural numbers a and b, then p divides a or p divides b.\n\nExistence\n\nWe need to show that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes.\nFor the base case, note that 2 is prime.\nBy strong induction: assume true for all numbers between 1 and n. If n is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers a and b,  where n = ab and 1 1p2...pj\nand\nb = q1q2...qk are products of primes. But then\nn ab \n p1p2...pjq1q2...qk is a product of primes.\n\nUniqueness\n\nAssume that s > 1 is the product of prime numbers in two different ways:\n\n\\begin{align}\ns\n&=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n\nWe must show m = n and that the qj are a rearrangement of the pi.\n\nAs p1 divides s, Euclid's lemma implies that p1 divides one of the qj; relabeling the qj if necessary, say that p1 divides q1. But q1 is prime, so its only divisors are itself and 1. Therefore, p1 = q1, so that\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{s}{p_1}\n&=p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n\nReasoning the same way, p2 must equal one of the remaining qj. Relabeling again if necessary, say p2 = q2. Then\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{s}{p_1 p_2}\n&=p_3 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_3 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n\nThis can be done for each of the m pi's, showing that m ≤ n and every pi is a qj. Applying the same argument with the p's and q's reversed shows n ≤ m (hence  m = n) and every qj is a pi.\n\nElementary proof of uniqueness\n\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma, as follows:\n\nAssume that s > 1 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. If s were prime then it would factor uniquely as itself, so there must be at least two primes in each factorization of s:\n\n\\begin{align}\ns\n&=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n\nIf any pi qj then, by cancellation, s/pi \n s/qj would be another positive integer, different from s, which is greater than 1 and also has two distinct factorizations. But s/pi is smaller than s, meaning s would not actually be the smallest such integer. Therefore every pi must be distinct from every qj.\n\nWithout loss of generality, take p1 1 (if this is not already the case, switch the p and q designations.) Consider\n\nt = (q_1 - p_1)(q_2 \\cdots q_n),\n\nand note that 1 2 ≤ t \n\\begin{align}\nt\n&= q_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) - p_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) \\\\\n&= s - p_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) \\\\\n&= p_1((p_2 \\cdots p_m) - (q_2 \\cdots q_n)).\n\\end{align}\n\nHere u ((p2 ... pm) - (q2 ... qn)) is positive, for if it were negative or zero then so would be its product with p1, but that product equals t which is positive. So u is either 1 or factors into primes. In either case, t \n p1u yields a prime factorization of t, which we know to be unique, so p1 appears in the prime factorization of t.\n\nIf (q1 - p1) equaled 1 then the prime factorization of t would be all qs, which would preclude p1 from appearing. Thus  (q1 - p1) is not 1, but is positive, so it factors into primes: (q1 - p1) = (r1 ... rh). This yields a prime factorization of\n\nt = (r_1 \\cdots r_h)(q_2 \\cdots q_n),\n\nwhich we know is unique. Now, p1 appears in the prime factorization of t, and it is not equal to any q, so it must be one of the rs. That means p1 is a factor of (q1 - p1), so there exists a positive integer k such that p1k = (q1 - p1), and therefore\n\np_1(k+1) = q_1.\n\nBut that means q1 has a proper factorization, so it is not a prime number. This contradiction shows that s does not actually have two different prime factorizations. As a result, there is no smallest positive integer with multiple prime factorizations, hence all positive integers greater than 1 factor uniquely into primes.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nThe first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on biquadratic reciprocity. This paper introduced what is now called the ring of Gaussian integers, the set of all complex numbers a + bi where a and b are integers. It is now denoted by \\mathbb{Z}[i]. He showed that this ring has the four units ±1 and ±i, that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes.Gauss, BQ, §§ 31–34\n\nSimilarly, in 1844 while working on cubic reciprocity, Eisenstein introduced the ring \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega], where   \\omega\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2},    \\omega^3\n1  is a cube root of unity. This is the ring of Eisenstein integers, and he proved it has the six units \\pm 1, \\pm\\omega, \\pm\\omega^2 and that it has unique factorization.\n\nHowever, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]. In this ring one has\n\n62\\cdot 3\n\n(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5}).\n\nExamples like this caused the notion of \"prime\" to be modified. In \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, e.g., 2 = ab, then one of a or b must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of \"prime\". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; e.g.,\n2 divides neither (1 + ) nor (1 − ) even though it divides their product 6. In algebraic number theory 2 is called irreducible in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not prime in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in \\mathbb{Z}. Using these definitions it can be proven that in any ring a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as \"in the ring of integers \\mathbb{Z} every irreducible is prime\". This is also true in \\mathbb{Z}[i] and \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega], but not in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}].\n\nThe rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called unique factorization domains. Important examples are polynomial rings over the integers or over a field, Euclidean domains and principal ideal domains.\n\nIn 1843 Kummer introduced the concept of ideal number, which was developed further by Dedekind (1876) into the modern theory of ideals, special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called Dedekind domains.\n\nThere is a version of unique factorization for ordinals, though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.",
