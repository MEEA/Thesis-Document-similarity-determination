  "textBody" : "Dacoity is a term used for \"banditry\" in Bengali, Odiya, Hindi, Kannada and Urdu. The spelling is the anglicized version of the Hindustani word and as a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning, it appears in the Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases (1903).HereThe genesis of dacoity [armed robbery by a gang] in Chambal valley [north-central India] has been a popular theme too (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Again, most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. The fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley. (Defined by Arvind Verma, in Jul-Dec 2008) \"Anglo-Indian\"  refers to the language, or linguistic usage. See Yule, Henry and Burnell, Arthur Coke (1886) Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive J. Murry, London; reprinted 1903; see page [https://books.google.com/books?id6Z5iAAAAMAAJ&pg\nPA290 page 290] of the 1903 edition for \"dacoit\". Banditry is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule. Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word \"dacoity\", the anglicized version of the Hindustani word ḍakaitī (historically spelled dakaitee, Hindi  डकैती or Urdu ڈکیتی or Bengali ডাকাতি, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି ), comes from ḍākū (historically spelled dakoo, Hindi: डाकू, Urdu: ڈاکو, meaning \"armed robber\") or Bengali ḍakat (ডাকাত, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି).\n\nIn Urdu, ḍākū ڈاکو is singular and ḍakait ڈکیت plural for bandits. The crime of banditry is known as dakaitee ڈکیتی.\n\nIn Hindi dacoity (Hindi: डकैती ḍakaitī, Urdu: ڈکیتی ḍakaitī, Bengali: ডাকাতি  ḍakati, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means \"armed robbery\".\n\nThe term dacoit (Hindi: डकैत ḍakait, Urdu: ڈکیت ḍakait, Bengali: ডাকাত ḍākāt, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means \"a bandit\", according to the OED (\"A member of a class of robbers in India and Burma, who plunder in armed bands.\") Dacoits existed in Burma as well as in India - Rudyard Kipling's fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in \"The Taking of Lungtungpen\". Sax Rohmer's criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu also employed Burmese dacoits as his henchmen. The term also applied, according to the OED, to \"pirates who formerly infested the Ganges between Calcutta and Burhampore\".\n\nIndian police forces use \"Known Dacoit\" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.\n\nThe dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and Chambal regions in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDacoits\n\nNotable dacoits include:\n*Malangi\n*Phoolan Devi\n*Dadua\n*Daku Man SinghStaff (5 September 1955) [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893055,00.html \"India: Dead Man\"] Time magazine  He was involved in 90 police encounters and killed 32 police officers.\n*Nirbhay Gujjar\n*Sultana Daku\n\nProtection measures\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity.  The chief minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.[http://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/05/27/indian-women-granted-gun-permits-to-fend-off-armed-robbers/ \"Indian Women Granted Gun Permits to Fend Off Armed Robbers\"]  LearnAboutGuns.com\n\nPopular culture\n\nDacoit films\n\nAs the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various Hindi films made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in Bollywood. The genre began with Mehboob Khan's Aurat (1940), which he remade as Mother India (1957). Mother India received an Academy Award nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with Dilip Kumar's Gunga Jumna (1961). Other popular films in this genre included Raj Kapoor’s Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai (1961) and Moni Bhattacharjee's Mujhe Jeene Do (1963).\n\nPakistani actor Akmal Khan had two dacoit films, Malangi (1965) and Imam Din Gohavia (1967). Other films in this genre included Khote Sikkay (1973), Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971), and Kuchhe Dhaage (1973) both by Raj Khosla.\n\nThe most famous dacoit film is Sholay (1975), written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan, and with its dacoit character Gabbar Singh played by Amjad Khan. It was a masala film that combined the dacoit film conventions of Mother India and Gunga Jumna with that of Spaghetti Westerns, spawning the Dacoit Western genre, often known as the \"Curry Western\" genre. Sholay became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including Ganga Ki Saugandh (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.\n\nPunjabi biopic Jatt Jeona Morh about the noted dacoit Jatt Jeona Morh, was made in 1991; also in that same year came Jagga Daku, based on a noted outlaw and dacoit during the British Raj, Jagga Daku.\n\nAn internationally acclaimed example of the genre is Bandit Queen (1994).\n\nTamil movie, Karthi starrer Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017) deals elaborately about Bandits.
