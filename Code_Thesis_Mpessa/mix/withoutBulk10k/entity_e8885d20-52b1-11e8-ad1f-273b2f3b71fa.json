According to its primary historian (Adam Gorightly) Discordianism was founded as a parody religion. Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion although some of its adherents may utilize it as a legitimate religion, or a metaphor for a governing philosophy.\"...It should on no account be taken seriously but is far more serious than most jokes\" and \"See ...

Discordia, the goddess of chaos, or archetypes and or ideals associated with her. The Principia Discordia holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order) and the Eristic  (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,Rabinovitch, Shelly & Lewis, James. The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism\". Pp 75–76. Citadel Press. 2002. . and because there is an encouragement to form schisms and cabals.\nFounding and structure \n\nThe foundational document of Discordianism is the Principia Discordia, fourth edition, written by Malaclypse the Younger, an alias of Greg Hill. The Principia Discordia often hints that Discordianism was founded as a dialectic antithesis to more popular religions based on order, although the rhetoric throughout the book describes chaos as a much more underlying impulse of the universe. This may have been done with the intention of merely \"balancing out\" the creative forces of order and disorder, but the focus is on the more disorderly aspects of the world – at times the forces of order are even vilified.\nEpiskopos\n\nEpiskoposes are the overseers of sects of Discordianism, who have presumably created their own sect of Discordianism. They speak to Eris through the use of their pineal gland. It is said in the Principia Discordia that Eris says different things to each listener. She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of what she says is equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).\n\nMost Episkoposes have an assumed name and/or title of self-proclaimed 'mystic import', such as Malaclypse the Younger, Polyfather of Virginity in Gold; Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, Bull Goose of Limbo; Professor Mu-Chao; and Kassil the Erratic. Some Discordians choose their entire title by themselves, some turn to random generators, others assimilate things from other people, and a few never really offer any explanation.\nPopes\n\nAccording to the Principia Discordia, “every single man, woman, and child on this Earth” is deemed a pope.Malaclypse the Younger, Principia Discordia, Page 00036\n\nIncluded in the Principia Discordia is an official pope card that may be reproduced and distributed freely to anyone and everyone. Papacy, however, is not granted through possession of this card; it merely informs people that they are “a genuine and authorized Pope” of Discordia.\nMythology \n\nEris and Aneris\n\nIn discordian mythology, Aneris is described as the sister of Eris a.k.a. Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the goddess of disorder and being, Aneris/Harmonia is the goddess of order and non-being.\n\n\"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY' \" in Principia Discordia, states:\n\nIn the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING, named ANERIS.\n\nThe sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.\n\nAnd to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.\n\nThe names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, Spirituality), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in \"Psycho-Metaphysics\":\n\nThe Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.See (a certain chapter [about \"SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS\"] of Principia Discordia) For an online version, see:  (Note: Geocities is now defunct, but \"see also\" Reocities, which is a static snapshot, that does not require you to have an \"archiveurl\" from the Wayback machine.) \nHand of Eris\n\nThe hand of Eris (shown at right) and other proposed symbols are used informally in certain circles; however, it is unlikely that Eris will be assigned an official symbol by the IAU, since graphical symbols are rarely assigned to minor objects in modern times.Keiron Le Grice: Discovering Eris: The Symbolism and Significance of a New Planetary Archetype. Edinburgh 2012,  A request to the Unicode Consortium to add the hand as a unicode symbol to represent the planet, along with a symbol for 90377 Sedna, was filed in 2016.\n\nThe \"original snub\"\n\nThe \"original snub\" is the Discordian name for the events preceding the judgement of Paris, although more focus is put on the actions of Eris. Zeus believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to Peleus and Thetis's wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word kallisti (, to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the Apple of Discord, is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold.[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html The Judgement of Paris]\n\nSome recent interpretations of the original snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis. This interpretation would see Eris as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding.\n\nPhilosophy \n\nThree core principles\n\nThe Principia Discordia holds three core principles: the Aneristic and Eristic principle representing order and disorder, and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:\nOperation Mindfuck\n\nOperation Mindfuck is an important practice in the Discordian religion. The concept was developed by Kerry Thornley and Robert Anton Wilson in 1968 and given its name by Wilson and Robert Shea in The Illuminatus! Trilogy.\nWritings\n\nDiscordian works include a number of books, not all of which actually exist. Among those that have been published are Principia Discordia, first published in 1965 (which includes portions of The Honest Book of Truth); and The Illuminatus! Trilogy, which had its first volume published in 1975.Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati (1977), page 167. \n\nThe Principia Discordia is a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) with Kerry Wendell Thornley (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).The phrase Principia Discordia, reminiscent of Newton's Principia Mathematica, is presumably intended to mean Discordant Principles, or Principles of Discordance.In Latin, discordia is not an adjective. It can be a singular noun by itself, meaning \"discord\", or, like principia, be the plural of a noun – discordium, also meaning \"discord\". In either case, the phrase consists of two juxtaposed nouns without a grammatical relationship.\n\nSumma Universalia was another work by Malaclypse the Younger, purported to be a summary of the universe. It was excerpted in the first edition of Principia but never published. It was mentioned in an introduction to one of the Principia editions, and the work was quoted from in the first edition.\"By no means is the Principia our only scripture. All along Greg has been writing what he says is a summary of the Universe, but evidently it will be quite some time before he completes it.\" Thornley, Kerry: \"Principia Discordia\", page ix.

A selection of the material was later reedited and expanded by Thornley and republished in paperback by IllumiNet Press in 1991.

It includes tales of several early Discordians including Hill (as Mal) and Thornley (as Omar and Ho Chi Zen).  \"Enlightenment of a Seeker\" from this book is also present in Principia Discordia as \"A Zen Story\".Camden Benares: Zen Without Zen Masters (1977), pages 40-41. \nPrincipia Discordia editions\n\nThe first edition was printed using Jim Garrison's Xerox printer in 1963.
