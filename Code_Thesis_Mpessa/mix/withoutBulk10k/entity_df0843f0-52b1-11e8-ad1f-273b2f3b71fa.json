  "textBody" : "Chuck-a-luck, also known as birdcage, is a game of chance played with three dice. It is derived from grand hazard and both can be considered a variant of sic bo, which is a popular casino game, although chuck-a-luck is more of a carnival game than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for charity.\n\nRules\n\nChuck-a-luck is played with three standard dice that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an hourglass that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.\n\nWagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice.  The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in sic bo and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.\n\nThe wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.\n\nHouse advantage or edge\n\nChuck-a-luck is a game of chance. That is, on average, the players are expected to lose more than they win.  The casino's advantage (house advantage or house edge) is greater than most other casino games and can be much greater.\n\nFor example, there are 216 (6 × 6 × 6) possible outcomes for a single throw of three dice. For a specific number:\n\n* there are 75 possible outcomes, where only one die will match the number;\n* there are 15 possible outcomes, where only two dice will match; and\n* there is one possible outcome, where all three dice will match.\n\nAt odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 11) = 4.6%\n\nAt worse odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 4) = 7.9%\n\nIt should be noted that if the odds are adjusted to 1 to 1, 3 to 1 and 5 to 1 respectively, the expected loss as a percentage is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 4 + (1/216) × 6) = 0%\n\nHowever, commercially organised gambling games always have a house advantage which acts as a fee for the privilege of being allowed to play the game, so the last scenario does not represent real practice.\n\nVariants\n\n* A version of the Big Six wheel is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with various combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.\n* Chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to the traditional Vietnamese game Bau cua ca cop.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThere is a reference to chuck-a-luck in the Abbott and Costello film Hold That Ghost.\n\nIn Fritz Lang's 1952 film, Rancho Notorious, chuck-a-luck is the name of the ranch run by Altar Keane (played by Marlene Dietrich) where outlaws hide from the law. Chuck-a-luck is featured in the lyrics to the theme song and in some plot points.\n\nThe game is played by Lazar in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun.\n\nThe game is played by Freddie Rumsen in Mad Men Season 2 Episode 9: Six-Month Leave.",
