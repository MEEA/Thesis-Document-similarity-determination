  "textBody" : "Jackson is a city in the south central area of the U.S. state of Michigan, about 40 mi west of Ann Arbor and 35 mi south of Lansing. It is the county seat of Jackson County. \nAs of the 2010 census, the city population was 33,534, down from 36,316 at the 2000 census. Served by Interstate 94, it is the principal city of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Jackson County and has a population of 160,248.Population of Michigan Regions and Statistical Areas, 2000 and 2010, at www.michigan.gov\n\nFounded in 1829, it was named after President Andrew Jackson. By the late 19th century, it had developed as a railroad hub and was known as the crossroads of Michigan. It had strong manufacturing by 1910 of a variety of automobiles and parts, and was also a center of corset manufacturing into the 1920s. As an industrial city, it attracted numerous European immigrants and migrants from the American South, both white and black, who were seeking better economic opportunity. The first state prison was built here and by 1882 had developed as the largest walled prison in the world, containing both factory facilities and farmland. A new prison was built in 1934 north of the city limits.\n\nHistory\n\nOn July 3, 1829, Horace Blackman, accompanied by Alexander Laverty, a land surveyor, and Pewytum, an Indian guide, forded the Grand River and made camp for the night at a site now marked as Trail and N. Jackson Street. They arrived there along a well-traveled Native American trail leading west from Ann Arbor. Blackman hired Laverty and Pewytum to guide him west. Returning to Ann Arbor and Monroe, Blackman registered his claim for 160 acre at two dollars an acre. He returned to the Jackson area in August 1829 with his brother Russell. Together they cleared land and built a cabin at what would become the corner of Ingham and Trail streets. The town was first called Jacksonopolis. Later, it was renamed Jacksonburgh. Finally in 1838, the town's name was changed to simply Jackson.\n\nBirthplace of the Republican Party – \"Under the Oaks\"\n\nJackson is one of the birthplaces of the Republican Party. The first official meeting of the group that called itself \"Republican\" was held in Jackson on July 6, 1854.[http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/316 \"Under the Oaks\"], Experience Jackson website A Michigan historical marker at what is now the northwest corner of Second and Franklin streets in Jackson commemorates an anti-slavery county convention held that day. Meeting outside to avoid a hot, over-crowded hall, the group ultimately selected a slate of candidates for state elections. The marker identifies this as the birth of the Republican Party. The site, an oak grove on \"Morgan's Forty\", then on the outskirts of town, became known as \"Under the Oaks\".\n\nAuto industry\n\nEven before Detroit began building cars on assembly lines in 1910, Jackson factories were making parts for cars and putting them together. By 1910, the auto industry had become Jackson's main industry. More than 20 different brands of cars were once made in Jackson, including: Reeves, Jaxon, Jackson, CarterCar, Orlo, Whiting, Butcher and Gage; Buick, Janney, Globe, Steel Swallow, C.V.I., Imperial, Ames-Dean, Cutting, Standard Electric, Duck, Briscoe, Argo, Hollier, Hackett, Marion-Handly, Gem, Earl, Wolverine, and Kaiser-Darrin. \nThe [http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/319 Ye Ole Carriage Shop] in Spring Arbor displays more than 60 antique and classic cars, including five one-and-onlys and 16 made in Jackson. One of these is a 1902 JAXON. Today the auto parts industry remains one of the largest employers of skilled machine operators in Jackson County. The city was an early home to the moped parts industry. \n\nBirthplace of the Coney Island hot dog\n\nIn 1914 George Todoroff founded the first \"Coney Island restaurant\" and created his famous Coney Island hot dog topping.  His Coney Island restaurant was located directly in front of the railroad station on East Michigan Avenue and was open 24 hours. The restaurant proved to be a popular dining option for rail passengers. Over the course of 31 years, Todoroff sold more than 17 million Coney Island hot dogs. Today two Coney Island restaurants unaffiliated with Todoroff's are located in a building near the train station on East Michigan Avenue, Virginia Coney Island and Jackson Coney Island.  In addition, several area restaurants throughout the Jackson area offer their own version of the Coney Island hot dog, or just \"coney\" as referred to by local residents. Jackson's version of the coney dog is distinctly different from those featured in Detroit-area Coney Island restaurants or other Coney Island restaurants throughout Michigan and the Midwest. In 2014 Todoroff's Coney Island celebrated its centenary.[http://www.todoroffs.com/toci/Our_History/our_history_index.htm]\n\nMichigan's first state prison (1838–1934) \n\nThe legislature authorized Michigan's first state prison in 1838. A temporary wooden prison, enclosed by a fence of tamarack poles, was built on 60 acres donated for that purpose inside the city limits of Jackson. In 1839 the first 35 prisoners were received. A permanent prison was built three years later. \nBeginning in the 1850s, Warden H.F. Hatch placed more emphasis on the education and rehabilitation of prisoners. By 1882, Michigan’s First State Prison (1838–1934) had developed as the largest walled prison in the world.  Within its walls, the factories and surrounding farms, manned by cheap inmate labor, made Jackson one of the leading industrial cities in the nation. In 1934 a new prison was completed just north of Jackson's city limit in Blackman Township; it took all of the state prisoners.  \n\nThe historic building is now used as an artists’ resident community, known as the Armory Arts Village. Tours of the original prison site on Cooper Street are available through the [http://historicprisontours.com/ Original Jackson Historic Prison Tours]. A closed, fully intact cell block at the modern prison in Blackman Township is now operated as the [http://www.cellblock7.org/ Cell Block 7 Prison Museum]. Independently operated by the accredited [http://www.ellasharp.org/ Ella Sharp Museum], this is the only museum where visitors can enter a closed cell block on the grounds of an active prison for a self-guided tour.\n\nCorset industry (1860s-1920s)\n\nNumerous railroad connections were constructed to Jackson, connecting it to many markets. The local invention of the duplex corset by Bortree helped make Jackson a center of corset manufacturing. By the early 20th century, as many as 16 manufacturers of women’s corsets operated here; the majority of which were located on Cortland and Pearl streets. As elastics were adopted in manufacturing and fashions changed, the corset industry quickly declined. The majority of the corset manufacturers in Jackson closed their doors by 1920. Only three of the original corset companies survived past the 1920s, by changing their production to therapeutic and prosthetic support garments and devices.\n\n“The First”\nMoses Bortree founded the Bortree Corset Company, the first corset manufacturer outside of New York, in 1868 at 112 W. Cortland. Founded to make crinoline skirts and bustles (hoop skirts!), they began manufacturing Bortree’s newest creation, the Duplex Corset, in 1875. Within five years, production rose from 50,000 to 300,000 corsets per year.\n\n“The Biggest”\nFounded in 1884, the Jackson Corset Co. became the largest manufacturer of corset and waist garments in the US. Located at 209-215 W. Cortland St., they employed almost 300 people by 1895. \n\n“Woman-Owned”\nThe Coronet Corset Manufactory opened in 1880 at 146 W. Main St. and later moved to 131-133 W. Pearl St. Coronet had the distinction of being run by the first and only female president, Mrs. C.A. McGee, who invented and patented the Coronet Corset.\n\nSources: The History of Business and Industry in Jackson, Michigan by the Ella Sharp Museum, 1993 (available at Jackson District Library) and recent Jackson Citizen Patriot stories (available at http://www.mlive.com/jackson/).\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water.\n\nEconomy\n\nRestructuring in heavy industry in the mid-20th century caused a decline in jobs and population in many industrial cities, including Jackson. There are three major private employers in the city. CMS Energy provides natural gas and electrical services to much of Michigan and has its international headquarters in the city. The next two major employers are Allegiance Health (formerly Foote Hospital) and the Eaton Corporation.\n\nMichigan Automotive Compressor, Inc. (MACI) is the largest manufacturer in Jackson County and its fourth-largest individual employer. In February 2009 it began offering voluntary buyouts to its workers, in reaction to the slowing economy during the financial crisis.\n\nJackson Flexible Products, just outside the city, has been one of North America's premier custom-molded rubber specialists since 1969. The company employs over 35 people, providing components for the aerospace, automotive and defense industries.\n\nAs noted above in the History section, Jackson's state prison complex includes the first state prison building, which was expanded and became known as the largest walled prison in the world. Portions of the prison complex closed in 2007, including the Annex of the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center Annex (RGC)[http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-1381_1385-19490--,00.html \"Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center Annex (RGC) Closed November 2, 2007\"][http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/2008_MDOC_STATISTICAL_REPORT_287713_7.pdf Michigan Department of Corrections 2008 Statistical Report], pg.

The Jackson urbanized area is home to approximately 16 elementary public schools, as well as about 16 private or parochial schools.  It also has a large public middle school (The Middle School at Parkside) and Jackson Catholic Middle School. It has  nine high schools: the public Jackson High School, East Jackson Secondary School (Public), Jackson County Western High School, and Northwest High School, T. A. Wilson Academy, Napoleon High School, and Vandercook Lake High School; and the private DaVinci Institute (Charter), Jackson Christian School (Non-Denom), and Lumen Christi Catholic School (Catholic).\n\nThere is adult and higher education as well: Jackson College (formerly Jackson Community College), Baker College, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130407095906/http://www.cqlc.edu/ Career Quest Learning Centers], and Spring Arbor University.

The First Baptist Church was established in 1839; the present building, a Romanesque Revival structure, was dedicated in March 1872. The First Congregational Church is housed in a monumental Romanesque Revival building constructed in 1859. A basement was added after the structure had been in operation for several years. In 1871 the building was raised eight feet to accommodate lower-level classrooms.  Its congregation has actively participated in local social reform efforts, becoming part of the antislavery movement in the 1840s and later supporting the temperance and the civil rights movement. St. Paul's Episcopal Church was also founded in 1839. The congregation's first church building, constructed in 1840, was replaced by a Romanesque Revival building in 1853; it is one of the oldest Episcopal Church structures in southern Michigan.\n\nConstructed in 1857, St. John's the Evangelist Church is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the city. It was established as a mission in 1836 to serve a congregation that was originally predominately Irish immigrants. Given the following waves of Catholic immigrants from other countries, its congregation today is more diverse. St. Mary Star of the Sea was established in 1881 as Jackson's second Catholic church. The present building, a limestone Romanesque structure built between 1923 and 1926, incorporates elements of the parish's first church as well as stained glass windows, marble altars and communion rails imported from Italy and Austria.Ashlee, Laura R. Traveling through Time: A Guide to Michigan's Historical Markers, pp. 202–205. University of Michigan Press, 2005. \n\nLate 19th-century immigrants included Jews from Germany and eastern Europe. Jackson is home to Temple Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue founded in 1862 by German Jewish immigrants.\n\nTransportation\n\nFrom the late nineteenth century into the mid-twentieth century, Jackson was a major railway hub and for over a century has been known as the crossroads of Michigan.

It is the county seat of Jackson County. \nAs of the 2010 census, the city population was 33,534, down from 36,316 at the 2000 census. Served by Interstate 94, it is the principal city of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Jackson County and has a population of 160,248.Population of Michigan Regions and Statistical Areas, 2000 and 2010, at www.michigan.gov\n\nFounded in 1829, it was named after President Andrew Jackson. By the late 19th century, it had developed as a railroad hub and was known as the crossroads of Michigan. It had strong manufacturing by 1910 of a variety of automobiles and parts, and was also a center of corset manufacturing into the 1920s. As an industrial city, it attracted numerous European immigrants and migrants from the American South, both white and black, who were seeking better economic opportunity. The first state prison was built here and by 1882 had developed as the largest walled prison in the world, containing both factory facilities and farmland. A new prison was built in 1934 north of the city limits.\n\nHistory\n\nOn July 3, 1829, Horace Blackman, accompanied by Alexander Laverty, a land surveyor, and Pewytum, an Indian guide, forded the Grand River and made camp for the night at a site now marked as Trail and N. Jackson Street. They arrived there along a well-traveled Native American trail leading west from Ann Arbor. Blackman hired Laverty and Pewytum to guide him west. Returning to Ann Arbor and Monroe, Blackman registered his claim for 160 acre at two dollars an acre. He returned to the Jackson area in August 1829 with his brother Russell. Together they cleared land and built a cabin at what would become the corner of Ingham and Trail streets. The town was first called Jacksonopolis. Later, it was renamed Jacksonburgh. Finally in 1838, the town's name was changed to simply Jackson.\n\nBirthplace of the Republican Party – \"Under the Oaks\"\n\nJackson is one of the birthplaces of the Republican Party. The first official meeting of the group that called itself \"Republican\" was held in Jackson on July 6, 1854.[http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/316 \"Under the Oaks\"], Experience Jackson website A Michigan historical marker at what is now the northwest corner of Second and Franklin streets in Jackson commemorates an anti-slavery county convention held that day. Meeting outside to avoid a hot, over-crowded hall, the group ultimately selected a slate of candidates for state elections. The marker identifies this as the birth of the Republican Party. The site, an oak grove on \"Morgan's Forty\", then on the outskirts of town, became known as \"Under the Oaks\".\n\nAuto industry\n\nEven before Detroit began building cars on assembly lines in 1910, Jackson factories were making parts for cars and putting them together. By 1910, the auto industry had become Jackson's main industry. More than 20 different brands of cars were once made in Jackson, including: Reeves, Jaxon, Jackson, CarterCar, Orlo, Whiting, Butcher and Gage; Buick, Janney, Globe, Steel Swallow, C.V.I., Imperial, Ames-Dean, Cutting, Standard Electric, Duck, Briscoe, Argo, Hollier, Hackett, Marion-Handly, Gem, Earl, Wolverine, and Kaiser-Darrin. \nThe [http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/319 Ye Ole Carriage Shop] in Spring Arbor displays more than 60 antique and classic cars, including five one-and-onlys and 16 made in Jackson. One of these is a 1902 JAXON. Today the auto parts industry remains one of the largest employers of skilled machine operators in Jackson County. The city was an early home to the moped parts industry. \n\nBirthplace of the Coney Island hot dog\n\nIn 1914 George Todoroff founded the first \"Coney Island restaurant\" and created his famous Coney Island hot dog topping.  His Coney Island restaurant was located directly in front of the railroad station on East Michigan Avenue and was open 24 hours. The restaurant proved to be a popular dining option for rail passengers. Over the course of 31 years, Todoroff sold more than 17 million Coney Island hot dogs. Today two Coney Island restaurants unaffiliated with Todoroff's are located in a building near the train station on East Michigan Avenue, Virginia Coney Island and Jackson Coney Island.  In addition, several area restaurants throughout the Jackson area offer their own version of the Coney Island hot dog, or just \"coney\" as referred to by local residents. Jackson's version of the coney dog is distinctly different from those featured in Detroit-area Coney Island restaurants or other Coney Island restaurants throughout Michigan and the Midwest. In 2014 Todoroff's Coney Island celebrated its centenary.[http://www.todoroffs.com/toci/Our_History/our_history_index.htm]\n\nMichigan's first state prison (1838–1934) \n\nThe legislature authorized Michigan's first state prison in 1838. A temporary wooden prison, enclosed by a fence of tamarack poles, was built on 60 acres donated for that purpose inside the city limits of Jackson. In 1839 the first 35 prisoners were received. A permanent prison was built three years later. \nBeginning in the 1850s, Warden H.F. Hatch placed more emphasis on the education and rehabilitation of prisoners. By 1882, Michigan’s First State Prison (1838–1934) had developed as the largest walled prison in the world.  Within its walls, the factories and surrounding farms, manned by cheap inmate labor, made Jackson one of the leading industrial cities in the nation. In 1934 a new prison was completed just north of Jackson's city limit in Blackman Township; it took all of the state prisoners.  \n\nThe historic building is now used as an artists’ resident community, known as the Armory Arts Village. Tours of the original prison site on Cooper Street are available through the [http://historicprisontours.com/ Original Jackson Historic Prison Tours]. A closed, fully intact cell block at the modern prison in Blackman Township is now operated as the [http://www.cellblock7.org/ Cell Block 7 Prison Museum]. Independently operated by the accredited [http://www.ellasharp.org/ Ella Sharp Museum], this is the only museum where visitors can enter a closed cell block on the grounds of an active prison for a self-guided tour.\n\nCorset industry (1860s-1920s)\n\nNumerous railroad connections were constructed to Jackson, connecting it to many markets. The local invention of the duplex corset by Bortree helped make Jackson a center of corset manufacturing. By the early 20th century, as many as 16 manufacturers of women’s corsets operated here; the majority of which were located on Cortland and Pearl streets. As elastics were adopted in manufacturing and fashions changed, the corset industry quickly declined. The majority of the corset manufacturers in Jackson closed their doors by 1920. Only three of the original corset companies survived past the 1920s, by changing their production to therapeutic and prosthetic support garments and devices.\n\n“The First”\nMoses Bortree founded the Bortree Corset Company, the first corset manufacturer outside of New York, in 1868 at 112 W. Cortland. Founded to make crinoline skirts and bustles (hoop skirts!), they began manufacturing Bortree’s newest creation, the Duplex Corset, in 1875. Within five years, production rose from 50,000 to 300,000 corsets per year.\n\n“The Biggest”\nFounded in 1884, the Jackson Corset Co. became the largest manufacturer of corset and waist garments in the US. Located at 209-215 W. Cortland St., they employed almost 300 people by 1895. \n\n“Woman-Owned”\nThe Coronet Corset Manufactory opened in 1880 at 146 W. Main St. and later moved to 131-133 W. Pearl St. Coronet had the distinction of being run by the first and only female president, Mrs. C.A. McGee, who invented and patented the Coronet Corset.\n\nSources: The History of Business and Industry in Jackson, Michigan by the Ella Sharp Museum, 1993 (available at Jackson District Library) and recent Jackson Citizen Patriot stories (available at http://www.mlive.com/jackson/).\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water.\n\nEconomy\n\nRestructuring in heavy industry in the mid-20th century caused a decline in jobs and population in many industrial cities, including Jackson. There are three major private employers in the city. CMS Energy provides natural gas and electrical services to much of Michigan and has its international headquarters in the city. The next two major employers are Allegiance Health (formerly Foote Hospital) and the Eaton Corporation.\n\nMichigan Automotive Compressor, Inc. (MACI) is the largest manufacturer in Jackson County and its fourth-largest individual employer. In February 2009 it began offering voluntary buyouts to its workers, in reaction to the slowing economy during the financial crisis.\n\nJackson Flexible Products, just outside the city, has been one of North America's premier custom-molded rubber specialists since 1969. The company employs over 35 people, providing components for the aerospace, automotive and defense industries.\n\nAs noted above in the History section, Jackson's state prison complex includes the first state prison building, which was expanded and became known as the largest walled prison in the world. Portions of the prison complex closed in 2007, including the Annex of the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center Annex (RGC)[http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-1381_1385-19490--,00.html \"Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center Annex (RGC) Closed November 2, 2007\"][http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/2008_MDOC_STATISTICAL_REPORT_287713_7.pdf Michigan Department of Corrections 2008 Statistical Report], pg.

The Jackson urbanized area is home to approximately 16 elementary public schools, as well as about 16 private or parochial schools.  It also has a large public middle school (The Middle School at Parkside) and Jackson Catholic Middle School. It has  nine high schools: the public Jackson High School, East Jackson Secondary School (Public), Jackson County Western High School, and Northwest High School, T. A. Wilson Academy, Napoleon High School, and Vandercook Lake High School; and the private DaVinci Institute (Charter), Jackson Christian School (Non-Denom), and Lumen Christi Catholic School (Catholic).\n\nThere is adult and higher education as well: Jackson College (formerly Jackson Community College), Baker College, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130407095906/http://www.cqlc.edu/ Career Quest Learning Centers], and Spring Arbor University.

The First Baptist Church was established in 1839; the present building, a Romanesque Revival structure, was dedicated in March 1872. The First Congregational Church is housed in a monumental Romanesque Revival building constructed in 1859. A basement was added after the structure had been in operation for several years. In 1871 the building was raised eight feet to accommodate lower-level classrooms.  Its congregation has actively participated in local social reform efforts, becoming part of the antislavery movement in the 1840s and later supporting the temperance and the civil rights movement. St. Paul's Episcopal Church was also founded in 1839. The congregation's first church building, constructed in 1840, was replaced by a Romanesque Revival building in 1853; it is one of the oldest Episcopal Church structures in southern Michigan.\n\nConstructed in 1857, St. John's the Evangelist Church is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the city. It was established as a mission in 1836 to serve a congregation that was originally predominately Irish immigrants. Given the following waves of Catholic immigrants from other countries, its congregation today is more diverse. St. Mary Star of the Sea was established in 1881 as Jackson's second Catholic church. The present building, a limestone Romanesque structure built between 1923 and 1926, incorporates elements of the parish's first church as well as stained glass windows, marble altars and communion rails imported from Italy and Austria.Ashlee, Laura R. Traveling through Time: A Guide to Michigan's Historical Markers, pp. 202–205. University of Michigan Press, 2005. \n\nLate 19th-century immigrants included Jews from Germany and eastern Europe. Jackson is home to Temple Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue founded in 1862 by German Jewish immigrants.\n\nTransportation\n\nFrom the late nineteenth century into the mid-twentieth century, Jackson was a major railway hub and for over a century has been known as the crossroads of Michigan.
