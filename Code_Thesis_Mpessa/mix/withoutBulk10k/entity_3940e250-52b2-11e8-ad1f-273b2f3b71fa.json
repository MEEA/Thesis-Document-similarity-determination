A course for European Union integration and neutrality define the country's foreign policy guidelines.\n\nIn 1995, the country became the first post-Soviet state admitted to the Council of Europe. In addition to its participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, Moldova is a member state of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Francophonie and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\nIn 2005, Moldova and EU established an action plan that sought to improve the collaboration between the two neighboring structures. After the War of Transnistria, Moldova sought a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Transnistria region by working with Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, calling for international mediation, and cooperating with the OSCE and UN fact-finding and observer missions.\n\nOverview\n\nMoldova has established diplomatic relations with 97 states, the Holy See, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and the European Union.\n\nMoldova has not yet established diplomatic relations with:\n* Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti, St.Kitts and Nevis, St.Lucia, St.Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago\n* Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay\n* Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino\n* Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, DRCongo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo\n*Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Iraq, Laos, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan\n*Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu\n*The states with limited recognition.\n\nRelations with the European Union\n\nMoldova aspires to join the European Union[http://www.moldpres.md/default.asp?Langen&ID\n68715 Moldova will prove that it can and has chances to become EU member], Moldpress News Agency, June 19, 2007 and is implementing its first three-year Action Plan within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) of the EU.[http://politicom.moldova.org/stiri/eng/40/ Moldova-EU Action Plan Approved by European Commission] , December 14, 2004, retrieved July 2, 2007\n\nAs regards energy policy, Moldova was an observer to the treaty establishing Energy Community from the outset (2006). Following its interest in full membership, the European Commission was mandated to carry out negotiations with Moldova in 2007. In December 2009, the Energy Community Ministerial Council decided on the accession, but made it conditional to amendment of Moldova's gas law.[http://www.energy-community.org/portal/page/portal/ENC_HOME/DOCS/488187/Conclusions%20of%20the%207th%20MC%20Meeting.pdf Energy Community Ministerial Council Conclusions, Dec 2009]. Moldova joined the Energy Community as a full-fledged member in March 2010.\n\nRelations with NATO\n\nNATO relations with Moldova date back to 1992, when the country joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Moldova works alongside NATO allies and partner countries in a wide range of areas through the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\nRelations with the United States\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made a visit to Moldova in December 2013 to support the former Soviet republic's pro-Western moves in the face of Russian pressure.\n\nThe United States remains committed to the 5+2 negotiations process as a means to resolving the Transnistria conflict. The United States supports a comprehensive settlement that affirms Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while providing a special status for Transnistria.\n\nRelations with Romania\n\nMoldova's relations with its western neighbour, Romania, have been stressed since 1994. today's Moldova (without Transnistria) and parts of the old Bassarabia Governorate currently in Ukraine, were part of Romania during the interwar period (1918–40). Linguists generally agree that the Moldovan language is in fact identical with Romanian. However, Moldovans have been ambivalent about whether they consider themselves Romanians or Moldovans. Early signs that Romania and Moldova might unite after both countries achieved emancipation from communist rule quickly faded. Romania remains interested in Moldovan affairs, especially that country's civil conflict with the breakaway republic of Transnistria.  However, the two countries have been unable to reach agreement on a basic bilateral treaty; Romania is insistent (against determined Moldovan resistance) that such a treaty would have to refer to Romania and Moldova's 'special relationship'. Beginning in 1994, the two countries enjoyed a visa-free arrangement that ended on January 1, 2007, with Romania's entry into the European Union. This prompted many Moldovan citizens to apply for Romanian citizenship.[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=285660 Cetatenia romana, portita spre Europa]  December 27, 2006\n\nRelations with Russia and other post-Soviet states\n\nThe Moldovan Parliament approved the country's membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States and the CIS charter on economic union in April 1994. Moldova however has never participated in any military aspects of CIS, citing its neutrality status.\n\nIn 1998, Moldova contributed to the founding of GUAM, a regional cooperation agreement made up of Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova. Although the agreement initially included a declaration of mutual defense, Moldova has since declared its disinterest in participating in any GUAM-based mutual defense initiative.\n\nRussia continues to maintain a military presence in the Transnistrian region of Moldova, despite previous agreements with Moldova and within OSCE and CAF to withdraw its troops and ammunition.\n\nMoldova was granted Observer Status in the Russian-led Eurasian Union in April 2017.https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/moldova-granted-observer-status-in-eurasian-union/\n\nRelations with Israel\n\nThe establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Moldova began on 1992.\n\nMoldova has an embassy in Tel Aviv, Her Excellency Ambassador Mrs. Gabriela M and an honorary consulate ina Ashdod represented by Honorary Consul Mr. Moran Mano.\n\nIn 2016, Moldova nominated Honorary Consul in Israel of South region Mr. Moran Mano\n\nsee Israel–Moldova relations\n\nIsrael is represented in Moldova through its embassy in Kiev.\n\nSeparatist movements\n\nThe territory of Moldova includes the separatist Transnistria region.

The Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic controls main part of this region, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank. The international diplomatic situation with respect to the question of Transnistria determines and is determined by Moldova's relations with Russia.
