  "textBody" : "The word aeon, also spelled eon  (in American English) and æon, originally meant \"life\", \"vital force\" or \"being\", \"generation\" or \"a period of time\", though it tended to be translated as \"age\" in the sense of  \"ages\", \"forever\", \"timeless\" or \"for eternity\". It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word  (ho aion), from the archaic   (aiwon). In Homer it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the Sanskrit word kalpa and Hebrew word olam. A cognate Latin  word aevum or aeuum (cf. ) for \"age\" is present in words such as longevity and mediaeval.\n\nAlthough the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in geology, cosmology or astronomy), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite, period.  Aeon can also refer to the four aeons on the Geologic Time Scale that make up the Earth's history, the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and the current aeon Phanerozoic.\n\nAstronomy and cosmology\n\nIn astronomy an aeon is defined as a billion years (109 years, abbreviated AE). p. 4.\n \nRoger Penrose uses the word aeon to describe the period between successive and cyclic big bangs within the context of conformal cyclic cosmology.\n\nEternity or age\n\nThe Bible translation is a treatment of the Hebrew word olam and the Greek word aion.  Both these words have similar meaning, and Young's Literal Translation renders them and their derivatives as “age” or “age-during”. Other English versions most often translate them to indicate eternity, being translated as eternal, everlasting, forever, etc. However, there are notable exceptions to this in all major translations, such as : “…I am with you always, to the end of the age” (NRSV), the word “age” being a translation of aion. Rendering aion to indicate eternality in this verse would result in the contradictory phrase “end of eternity”, so the question arises whether it should ever be so.Canon F. W. Farrar “Mercy and Judgment” 1904 pages 378-382  Proponents of universal reconciliation point out that this has significant implications for the problem of hell.Thomas Talbott \"Three Pictures of God in Western Theology\" 1995 pages 13-15  Contrast  in well-known English translations with its rendering in Young's Literal Translation:\n\nAnd these shall go away to punishment age-during, but the righteous to life age-during. (YLT)Matthew 25:46 Young's Literal Translation\n\nThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.

After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of aeonian life or aeonian punishment. That is, after the period of the aeons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one ().  This contrasts with the conventional Christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment.\n\nOccultists of the Thelema and O.T.O. traditions sometimes speak of a \"magical Aeon\" that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.\n\nThe Order of Nine Angles, A UK-based Left Hand Path/Satanic organisation propose the concept of Aeons are central to the esoteric philosophy developed by the pseudonymous Anton Long, who wrote that \"an aeon is the term used [by the O9A] to describe a stage or a type of evolution. Evolution itself is taken to result from a certain specific process - and this process can be described, or explained [or 're-presented' ] via a bifurcation of time.
