Critics argue that these people are Arabs who migrated from Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia; a large part of the problem the Bedoon face is that these other states do not consider them as their nationals either.  In 2013, a law was passed to grant citizenship to 4,000 of these people as part of an attempt to resolve the problem.
