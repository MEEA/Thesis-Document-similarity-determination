  "textBody" : "Chios (; ; ) is the fifth largest of the Greek islands, situated in the Aegean Sea, 7 km off the Anatolian coast. The island is separated from Turkey by the Chios Strait. Chios is notable for its exports of mastic gum  and its nickname is the Mastic Island. Tourist attractions include its medieval villages and the 11th-century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAdministratively, the island forms a separate municipality within the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Chios town.[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior  Locals refer to Chios town as \"Chora\" (\"Χώρα\" literally means land or country, but usually refers to the capital or a settlement at the highest point of a Greek island).\n\nGeography\n\nChios island is crescent or kidney shaped, 50 km long from north to south, and 29 km at its widest, covering an area of 842289 km2. The terrain is mountainous and arid, with a ridge of mountains running the length of the island. The two largest of these mountains, Pelineon (1297 m) and Epos (1188 m), are situated in the north of the island. The center of the island is divided between east and west by a range of smaller peaks, known as Provatas.\n\nRegions\n\nChios can be divided into five regions:\n\nEast coast\n\nMidway up the east coast lie the main population centers, the main town of Chios, and the regions of Vrontados and Kambos. Chios Town, with a population of 32,400, is built around the island's main harbour and medieval castle. The current castle, with a perimeter of 1400 m, was principally constructed during the time of Venetian and Ottoman rule,  although remains have been found dating settlements there back to 2000 B.C. The town was substantially damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and only partially retains its original character.\n\nNorth of Chios Town lies the large suburb of Vrontados (population 4,500), which claims to be the birthplace of Homer. The suburb lies in the Omiroupoli municipality, and its connection to the poet is supported by an archaeological site known traditionally as \"Teacher's Rock\".Δασκαλóπετρα\n\nSouthern region (Mastichochoria)\n\nIn the southern region of the island are the MastichochoriaΜαστιχοχώρια (literally \"Mastic Villages\"), the seven villages of Mesta (Μεστά), Pyrgi (Πυργί), Olympi (Ολύμποι), Kalamoti (Καλαμωτń), Vessa (Βέσσα), Lithi (Λιθί), and Elata (Ελάτα), which together have controlled the production of mastic gum in the area since the Roman period. The villages, built between the 14th and 16th centuries, have a carefully designed layout with fortified gates and narrow streets to protect against the frequent raids by marauding pirates. Between Chios Town and the Mastichochoria lie a large number of historic villages including Armolia (Αρμόλια), Myrmighi (Μυρμήγκι), and Kalimassia (Καλλιμασιά). Along the east coast are the fishing villages of Kataraktis (Καταρράκτης) and to the south, Nenita (Νένητα).\n\nInterior\n\nDirectly in the centre of the island, between the villages of Avgonyma to the west and Karyes to the east, is the 11th century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monastery was built with funds given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX, after three monks, living in caves nearby, had petitioned him while he was in exile on the island of Mytilene. The monastery had substantial estates attached, with a thriving community until the massacre of 1822. It was further damaged during the 1881 earthquake.[http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/5/717/2005/nhess-5-717-2005.pdf 1881 and 1949 earthquakes at the Chios-Cesme Strait (Aegean Sea) and their relation to tsunamis] In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a convent.\n\nClimate\n\nThe island's climate is warm and moderate, categorised as Temperate, Mediterranean (Csa), with modest variation due to the stabilising effect of the surrounding sea. Average temperatures normally range from a summer high of 27 °C to a winter low of 11 °C in January, although temperatures of over 40 °C or below freezing can sometimes be encountered.\n\nThe island normally experiences steady breezes (average ) throughout the year, with wind direction predominantly northerly (\"Etesian\" Wind—locally called the \"Meltemi\") or southwesterly (Sirocco).\n\nGeology\n\nThe Chios Basin is a hydrographic sub-unit of the Aegean Sea adjacent to the island of Chios.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aegean_Sea?topic=49523 Aegean Sea. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nKnown as \"Ophioussa\" (Οφιούσσα, \"snake island\") and \"Pityoussa\" (Πιτυούσσα, \"pine-tree island\") in antiquity, during the later Middle Ages the island was ruled by a number of non-Greek powers and was known as Scio (Genoese), Chio (Italian) and Sakız (صاقيز —Ottoman Turkish). The capital during that time was \"Kastron\" (Κάστρον, \"castle\").\n\nPrehistoric period\n\nArchaeological research on Chios has found evidence of habitation dating back at least to the Neolithic era. The primary sites of research for this period have been cave dwellings at Hagio(n) Galas in the north and a settlement and accompanying necropolis in modern-day Emporeio at the far south of the island. Scholars lack information on this period. The size and duration of these settlements have therefore not been well-established.\n\nThe British School at Athens under the direction of Sinclair Hood excavated the Emporeio site in 1952–1955, and most current information comes from these digs.Boardman, John Excavations in Chios, 1952–1955: Greek Emporio (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens; Thames and Hudson, 1967), cf. also Hood, Sinclair Excavations in Chios, 1938–1955: prehistoric Emporio and Ayio Gala (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens: Thames and Hudson, 1981–)  The Greek Archaeological Service has also been excavating periodically on Chios since 1970, though much of its work on the island remains unpublished.\n\nThe noticeable uniformity in the size of houses at Emporeio leads some scholars to believe that there may have been little social distinction during the Neolithic era on the island. The inhabitants apparently all benefited from agricultural and livestock farming.Merouses, Nikos Chios. Physiko periballon & katoikese apo te neolithike epoche mechri to telos tes archaiothtas. (Chios. Natural Environment & Habitation from the Neolithic Age to the end of Antiquity) pg. 80. Papyros, 2002\n\nIt is also widely held by scholars that the island was not occupied by humans during the Middle Bronze Age (2300–1600), though researchers have recently suggested that the lack of evidence from this period may only demonstrate the lack of excavations on Chios and the northern Aegean.Merouses 2002 ch. 4\n\nBy at least the 11th century BC the island was ruled by a monarchy, and the subsequent transition to aristocratic (or possibly tyrannic) rule occurred sometime over the next four centuries. Future excavations may reveal more information about this period.Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 1 9th-century Euboean and Cypriote presence on the island is attested by ceramics, while a Phoenician presence is noted at Erythrae, the traditional competitor of Chios on the mainland.I.S. Lemos, The Protogeometric Aegean 2002:240, and Euboean ceramics in the Archeological Museum, noted by Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:60 note 59.\n\nArchaic and Classical periods\n\nPherecydes, native to the Aegean, wrote that the island was occupied by the Leleges,Strabo 14.1.3 aboriginal Greeks who were reported to be subjected to the Minoans on Crete.Herodotus 1.171 They were eventually driven out by invading Ionians.\n\nChios was one of the original twelve member states of the Ionian League. As a result, Chios, at the end of the 7th century BC,Agelarakis A., \"Analyses of Cremated Human Skeletal Remains Dating to the Seventh Century BC, Chios, Greece\".  Horos: Ena Archaeognostiko Periodiko 4 (1986): 145–153. was one of the first cities to strike or mint coins, establishing the sphinx as its symbol. It maintained this tradition for almost 900 years.\n\nIn the 6th century BC, Chios’ government adopted a constitution similar to that developed by Solon in Athens and later developed democratic elements with a voting assembly and people’s magistrates called damarchoi.Grant, Michael (1989). The Classical Greeks. Guild Publishing London. p.149\n\nIn 546 BC, Chios was subjected to the Persian Empire. Chios joined the Ionian Revolt against the Persians in 499 BC. The naval power of Chios during this period is demonstrated by the fact that the Chians had the largest fleet (100 ships) of all of the Ionians at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC. At Lade, the Chian fleet doggedly continued to fight the Persian fleet even after the defection of the Samians and others, but the Chians were ultimately forced to retreat and were again subjected to Persian domination.Herodotus, The Histories IV.15\n\nThe defeat of Persia at the Battle of Mycale in 479 BC meant the liberation of Chios from Persian rule. When the Athenians formed the Delian League, Chios joined as one of the few members who did not have to pay tribute but who supplied ships to the alliance.Thucydides, Peloponnesian War 3.10.\n\nBy the fifth to fourth centuries BC, the island had grown to an estimated population of over 120,000 (two to three times the estimated population in 2005), based on the huge necropolis at the main city of Chios. It is thought that the majority of the population lived in that area.Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 3\n\nIn 412 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, Chios revolted against Athens, and the Athenians besieged it. Relief only came the following year when the Spartans were able to raise the siege. In the 4th century BC, Chios was a member of the Second Athenian Empire but revolted against Athens during the Social War (357–355 BC), and Chios became independent again until the rise of Macedonia.\n\nHellenistic period\n\nTheopompus returned to Chios with the other exiles in 333 BC after Alexander had invaded Asia Minor and decreed their return,[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t75.html A translation of the decree can be viewed online] as well as the exile or trial of Persian supporters on the island. Theopompus was exiled again sometime after Alexander's death and took refuge in Egypt.[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/greek-lit/index.html Anthon, Charles A Manual of Greek Literature, p.251, 1853]\n\nDuring this period, the island also had become the largest exporter of Greek wine, which was noted for being of relatively high quality (see \"Chian wine\"). Chian amphoras, with a characteristic sphinx emblem and bunches of grapes, have been found in nearly every country with whom the ancient Greeks traded. These countries included Gaul, Upper Egypt, and Southern Russia.Hugh Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 41. Simon and Schuster 1989\n\nRoman period\n\nDuring the Third Macedonian War, thirty-five vessels allied to Rome, carrying about 1,000 Galatian troops, as well as a number of horses, were sent by Eumenes II to his brother Attalus.\n\nLeaving from Elaea, they were headed to the harbour of Phanae, planning to disembark from there to Macedonia. However, Perseus's naval commander Antenor intercepted the fleet between Erythrae (on the Western coast of Turkey) and Chios.\n\nAccording to Livy,Livy, 44.28 they were caught completely off-guard by Antenor. Eumenes' officers at first thought the intercepting fleet were friendly Romans, but scattered upon realizing they were facing an attack by their Macedonian enemy, some choosing to abandon ship and swim to Erythrae. Others, crashing their ships into land on Chios, fled toward the city.\n\nThe Chians however closed their gates, startled at the calamity. And the Macedonians, who had docked closer to the city anyway, cut the rest of the fleet off outside the city gates, and on the road leading to the city. Of the 1,000 men, 800 were killed, 200 taken prisoner.'\n\nAfter the Roman conquest Chios became part of the province of Asia.\n\nPliny remarks upon the islanders' use of variegated marble in their buildings, and their appreciation for such stone above murals or other forms of artificial decoration.\n\nAccording to the Acts of the Apostles, Luke the Evangelist, Paul the Apostle and their companions passed Chios during Paul's third missionary journey, on a passage from Lesbos to Samos.\n\nByzantine period\n\nAfter the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Chios was for six centuries part of the Byzantine Empire. This came to an end when the island was briefly held (1090–97) by Tzachas, a Turkish bey in the region of Smyrna during the first expansion of the Turks to the Aegean coast.Brownworth, Lars (2009) Lost to the West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire That Rescued Western Civilization, Crown Publishers, : \"...the Muslims captured Ephesus in 1090 and spread out to the Greek islands.  Chios, Rhodes, and Lesbos fell in quick succession.\" p. 233. However, the Turks were driven back from the Aegean coast by the Byzantines aided by the First Crusade, and the island was restored to Byzantine rule by admiral Constantine Dalassenos.\n\nThis relative stability was ended by the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade (1204) and during the turmoil of the 13th century the island's ownership was constantly affected by the regional power struggles. After the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine empire was divided up by the Latin emperors of Constantinople, with Chios nominally becoming a possession of the Republic of Venice. However, defeats for the Latin empire resulted in the island reverting to Byzantine rule in 1225.\n\nGenoese period (1304–1566)\n\nThe Byzantine rulers had little influence and through the Treaty of Nymphaeum, authority was ceded to the Republic of Genoa (1261).William Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/624735 \"The Zaccaria of Phocaea and Chios. (1275–1329.)\"] The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 31, 1911 (1911), pp. 42–55; . At this time the island was frequently attacked by pirates, and by 1302–1303 was a target for the renewed Turkish fleets. To prevent Turkish expansion, the island was reconquered and kept as a renewable concession, at the behest of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus, by the Genovese Benedetto I Zaccaria (1304), then admiral to Philip of France. Zaccaria installed himself as ruler of the island, founding the short-lived Lordship of Chios. His rule was benign and effective control remained in the hands of the local Greek landowners. Benedetto Zacharia was followed by his son Paleologo and then his grandsons or nephews Benedetto II and Martino. They attempted to turn the island towards the Latin and Papal powers, and away from the predominant Byzantine influence. The locals, still loyal to the Byzantine Empire, responded to a letter from the emperor and, despite a standing army of a thousand infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen and two galleys, expelled the Zacharia family from the island (1329) and dissolved the fiefdom.Arbel, Benjamin, Bernard Hamilton, and David Jacob. Latins and Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204. .\n\nLocal rule was brief. In 1346, a chartered company or Maona (the \"Maona di Chio e di Focea\") was set up in Genoa to reconquer and exploit Chios and the neighbouring town of Phocaea in Asia Minor. Although the islanders firmly rejected an initial offer of protection, the island was invaded by a Genoese fleet, led by Simone Vignoso, and the castle besieged. Again rule was transferred peacefully, as on 12 September the castle was surrendered and a treaty signed with no loss of privileges to the local landowners as long as the new authority was accepted.\n\nThe Genoese, being interested in profit rather than conquest, controlled the trade-posts and warehouses, in particular the trade of mastic, alum, salt and pitch. Other trades such as grain, wine oil and cloth and most professions were run jointly with the locals. After a failed uprising in 1347, and being heavily outnumbered (less than 10% of the population in 1395), the Latins maintained light control over the local population, remaining largely in the town and allowing full religious freedom. In this way the island remained under Genoese control for two centuries. By 1566, when Genoa lost Chios to the Ottoman Empire, there were 12.000 Greeks and 2.500 Genoese (or 17% of the total population) in the island.[http://www.chioshistory.gr/en/itx/itx22.html Chios History] \n\nOttoman period\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, the government and tax gathering again remained in the hands of Greeks and the Turkish garrison was small and inconspicuous.William St. Clair, That Greece Might Still Be Free, The Philhellenes in the War of Independence, Oxford University Press, London, 1972, p.79. .\n\nAs well as the Latin and Turkish influx, documents record a small Jewish population from at least 1049 AD. The original Greek (Romaniote) Jews, thought to have been brought over by the Romans, were later joined by Sephardic Jews welcomed by the Ottomans during the Iberian expulsions of the 15th century.\n\nThe mainstay of the island's famous wealth was the mastic crop. Chios was able to make a substantial contribution to the imperial treasury while at the same time maintaining only a light level of taxation. The Ottoman government regarded it as one of the most valuable provinces of the Empire.William St. Clair, p. 79\n\nModern period\n\nWhen the Greek War of Independence broke out, the island's leaders were reluctant to join the revolutionaries, fearing the loss of their security and prosperity. However, in March 1822, several hundred armed Greeks from the neighbouring island of Samos landed in Chios. They proclaimed the Revolution and launched attacks against the Turks, at which point islanders decided to join the struggle.\n\nOttomans landed a large force on the island consequently and put down the rebellion. The Ottoman massacre of Chios expelled, killed, or enslaved the inhabitants of the island.[http://greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/Genocide/el/2_Events Hellenic Genocide Events]  retrieved 19 May 2008 It wiped out whole villages and affected the Mastichochoria area, the mastic growing villages in the south of the island. It triggered negative public reaction in Western Europe, as portrayed by Eugène Delacroix, and in the writing of Lord Byron and Victor Hugo.\n\nIn 1881, an earthquake, estimated as 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale, damaged a large portion of the island's buildings and resulted in great loss of life. Reports of the time spoke of 5,500–10,000 fatalities.\n\nMeanwhile, Chios during this time emerges as the motherland of the modern Greek shipping industry. Indicatively, in 1764, Chios had 6 vessels with 90 sailors on record, in 1875 there were 104 ships with over 60,000 registered tonnes in 1889 were recorded 440 sailing ships of various types with 3,050 sailors. The dynamic development of Chian shipping in the 19th century is further attested by the various shipping related services that were present in the island during this time, such as the creation of the shipping insurance companies Chiaki Thalssoploia (Χιακή Θαλασσοπλοϊα), Dyo Adelfai (Δυο Αδελφαί), Omonoia (Ομονοια), the shipping bank Archangelos (Αρχάγγελος) (1863). The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong diaspora presence of Chian merchants, the connections they had developed with the financing centers of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.\n\nChios rejoined the rest of independent Greece after the First Balkan War (1912). The Greek Navy liberated Chios in November 1912 in a hard fought but brief amphibious operation. The Ottoman Empire recognized Greece's annexation of Chios and the other Aegean islands by the Treaty of London (1913).\n\nAlthough Greece was neutral the island was occupied by the British during World War I.They landed on 17 February 1916.This may have been due to the island's proximity to the Ottoman Empire and the city of İzmir in particular.\n\nIt was affected by the population exchanges after the Greco–Turkish War of 1919–1922, with the incoming Greek refugees settling in Kastro (previously Turkish) and in new settlements hurriedly built south of Chios Town.\n\nThe island saw some local violence during the Greek Civil War setting neighbour against neighbour.  This ended when the final band of communist fighters was trapped and killed in the orchards of Kambos and their bodies driven through the main town on the back of a truck.  In March 1948, the island was used as an internment camp for female political detainees (communists or relatives of guerillas) and their children, who were housed in military barracks near the town of Chios.  Up to 1300 women and 50 children were housed in cramped and degrading conditions, until March 1949 when the camp was closed and the inhabitants moved to Trikeri.Becoming a Subject: Political Prisoners During the Greek Civil War: Polymeris Voglis, Published 2002Berghahn Books \n\nThe production of mastic was threatened by the Chios forest fire that swept the southern half of the island in August 2012 and destroyed some mastic groves.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Chios has a permanent resident population of 52,674.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe present municipality Chios was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 8 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n*Agios Minas\n*Amani\n*Chios (town)\n*Ionia\n*Kampochora\n*Kardamyla\n*Mastichochoria\n*Omiroupoli\n\nEconomy\n\nCommerce\n\nThe local merchant shipping community transports several locally grown products including mastic, olives, figs, wine, mandarins, and cherries.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the island include:\n*kordelia\n*malathropita\n*sfougato\n*mamoulia (dessert)\n*masourakia (dessert)\n*mastichato (drink)\n\nAntimony Mines \n\nSporadically for some time at early 19th century to 1950s there was mining activity on the island at Keramos Antimony Mines.\n\nCulture\n\n*Nea Moni is a monastery with fine mosaics from Constantine IX's reign and a World Heritage Site.[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/212/21203n/e212cn01.html ] \n*An ancient inscription (at Chios Archaeological Museum) from a fifth-century funerary monument for Heropythos the son of Philaios, traced his family back over fourteen generations to Kyprios at the tenth century BC, before there were any written records in Greece.A Corpus of the Inscriptions of Chios (IG XII 6.3)\n;Forts\n*Castle of Chios, a Byzantine fort built in the 10th century\n**St. George's church\n\n;Museums\n*Chios Byzantine Museum\n*Archaeological Museum of Chios\n\n;Traditions\n*The town of Vrontados is home to a unique Easter celebration, where competing teams of locals gather at the town's two (rival) churches to fire tens of thousands of homemade rockets at the other church's bell tower while the Easter service is going on inside the churches, in what has become known as rouketopolemos.\n\n;Sports\n*F.C.

    "aggregatedText" : "Chios (; ; ) is the fifth largest of the Greek islands, situated in the Aegean Sea, 7 km off the Anatolian coast. The island is separated from Turkey by the Chios Strait. Chios is notable for its exports of mastic gum  and its nickname is the Mastic Island. Tourist attractions include its medieval villages and the 11th-century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAdministratively, the island forms a separate municipality within the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Chios town.[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior  Locals refer to Chios town as \"Chora\" (\"Χώρα\" literally means land or country, but usually refers to the capital or a settlement at the highest point of a Greek island).\n\nGeography\n\nChios island is crescent or kidney shaped, 50 km long from north to south, and 29 km at its widest, covering an area of 842289 km2. The terrain is mountainous and arid, with a ridge of mountains running the length of the island. The two largest of these mountains, Pelineon (1297 m) and Epos (1188 m), are situated in the north of the island. The center of the island is divided between east and west by a range of smaller peaks, known as Provatas.\n\nRegions\n\nChios can be divided into five regions:\n\nEast coast\n\nMidway up the east coast lie the main population centers, the main town of Chios, and the regions of Vrontados and Kambos. Chios Town, with a population of 32,400, is built around the island's main harbour and medieval castle. The current castle, with a perimeter of 1400 m, was principally constructed during the time of Venetian and Ottoman rule,  although remains have been found dating settlements there back to 2000 B.C. The town was substantially damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and only partially retains its original character.\n\nNorth of Chios Town lies the large suburb of Vrontados (population 4,500), which claims to be the birthplace of Homer. The suburb lies in the Omiroupoli municipality, and its connection to the poet is supported by an archaeological site known traditionally as \"Teacher's Rock\".Δασκαλóπετρα\n\nSouthern region (Mastichochoria)\n\nIn the southern region of the island are the MastichochoriaΜαστιχοχώρια (literally \"Mastic Villages\"), the seven villages of Mesta (Μεστά), Pyrgi (Πυργί), Olympi (Ολύμποι), Kalamoti (Καλαμωτń), Vessa (Βέσσα), Lithi (Λιθί), and Elata (Ελάτα), which together have controlled the production of mastic gum in the area since the Roman period. The villages, built between the 14th and 16th centuries, have a carefully designed layout with fortified gates and narrow streets to protect against the frequent raids by marauding pirates. Between Chios Town and the Mastichochoria lie a large number of historic villages including Armolia (Αρμόλια), Myrmighi (Μυρμήγκι), and Kalimassia (Καλλιμασιά). Along the east coast are the fishing villages of Kataraktis (Καταρράκτης) and to the south, Nenita (Νένητα).\n\nInterior\n\nDirectly in the centre of the island, between the villages of Avgonyma to the west and Karyes to the east, is the 11th century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monastery was built with funds given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX, after three monks, living in caves nearby, had petitioned him while he was in exile on the island of Mytilene. The monastery had substantial estates attached, with a thriving community until the massacre of 1822. It was further damaged during the 1881 earthquake.[http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/5/717/2005/nhess-5-717-2005.pdf 1881 and 1949 earthquakes at the Chios-Cesme Strait (Aegean Sea) and their relation to tsunamis] In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a convent.\n\nClimate\n\nThe island's climate is warm and moderate, categorised as Temperate, Mediterranean (Csa), with modest variation due to the stabilising effect of the surrounding sea. Average temperatures normally range from a summer high of 27 °C to a winter low of 11 °C in January, although temperatures of over 40 °C or below freezing can sometimes be encountered.\n\nThe island normally experiences steady breezes (average ) throughout the year, with wind direction predominantly northerly (\"Etesian\" Wind—locally called the \"Meltemi\") or southwesterly (Sirocco).\n\nGeology\n\nThe Chios Basin is a hydrographic sub-unit of the Aegean Sea adjacent to the island of Chios.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aegean_Sea?topic=49523 Aegean Sea. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nKnown as \"Ophioussa\" (Οφιούσσα, \"snake island\") and \"Pityoussa\" (Πιτυούσσα, \"pine-tree island\") in antiquity, during the later Middle Ages the island was ruled by a number of non-Greek powers and was known as Scio (Genoese), Chio (Italian) and Sakız (صاقيز —Ottoman Turkish). The capital during that time was \"Kastron\" (Κάστρον, \"castle\").\n\nPrehistoric period\n\nArchaeological research on Chios has found evidence of habitation dating back at least to the Neolithic era. The primary sites of research for this period have been cave dwellings at Hagio(n) Galas in the north and a settlement and accompanying necropolis in modern-day Emporeio at the far south of the island. Scholars lack information on this period. The size and duration of these settlements have therefore not been well-established.\n\nThe British School at Athens under the direction of Sinclair Hood excavated the Emporeio site in 1952–1955, and most current information comes from these digs.Boardman, John Excavations in Chios, 1952–1955: Greek Emporio (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens; Thames and Hudson, 1967), cf. also Hood, Sinclair Excavations in Chios, 1938–1955: prehistoric Emporio and Ayio Gala (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens: Thames and Hudson, 1981–)  The Greek Archaeological Service has also been excavating periodically on Chios since 1970, though much of its work on the island remains unpublished.\n\nThe noticeable uniformity in the size of houses at Emporeio leads some scholars to believe that there may have been little social distinction during the Neolithic era on the island. The inhabitants apparently all benefited from agricultural and livestock farming.Merouses, Nikos Chios. Physiko periballon & katoikese apo te neolithike epoche mechri to telos tes archaiothtas. (Chios. Natural Environment & Habitation from the Neolithic Age to the end of Antiquity) pg. 80. Papyros, 2002\n\nIt is also widely held by scholars that the island was not occupied by humans during the Middle Bronze Age (2300–1600), though researchers have recently suggested that the lack of evidence from this period may only demonstrate the lack of excavations on Chios and the northern Aegean.Merouses 2002 ch. 4\n\nBy at least the 11th century BC the island was ruled by a monarchy, and the subsequent transition to aristocratic (or possibly tyrannic) rule occurred sometime over the next four centuries. Future excavations may reveal more information about this period.Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 1 9th-century Euboean and Cypriote presence on the island is attested by ceramics, while a Phoenician presence is noted at Erythrae, the traditional competitor of Chios on the mainland.I.S. Lemos, The Protogeometric Aegean 2002:240, and Euboean ceramics in the Archeological Museum, noted by Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:60 note 59.\n\nArchaic and Classical periods\n\nPherecydes, native to the Aegean, wrote that the island was occupied by the Leleges,Strabo 14.1.3 aboriginal Greeks who were reported to be subjected to the Minoans on Crete.Herodotus 1.171 They were eventually driven out by invading Ionians.\n\nChios was one of the original twelve member states of the Ionian League. As a result, Chios, at the end of the 7th century BC,Agelarakis A., \"Analyses of Cremated Human Skeletal Remains Dating to the Seventh Century BC, Chios, Greece\".  Horos: Ena Archaeognostiko Periodiko 4 (1986): 145–153. was one of the first cities to strike or mint coins, establishing the sphinx as its symbol. It maintained this tradition for almost 900 years.\n\nIn the 6th century BC, Chios’ government adopted a constitution similar to that developed by Solon in Athens and later developed democratic elements with a voting assembly and people’s magistrates called damarchoi.Grant, Michael (1989). The Classical Greeks. Guild Publishing London. p.149\n\nIn 546 BC, Chios was subjected to the Persian Empire. Chios joined the Ionian Revolt against the Persians in 499 BC. The naval power of Chios during this period is demonstrated by the fact that the Chians had the largest fleet (100 ships) of all of the Ionians at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC. At Lade, the Chian fleet doggedly continued to fight the Persian fleet even after the defection of the Samians and others, but the Chians were ultimately forced to retreat and were again subjected to Persian domination.Herodotus, The Histories IV.15\n\nThe defeat of Persia at the Battle of Mycale in 479 BC meant the liberation of Chios from Persian rule. When the Athenians formed the Delian League, Chios joined as one of the few members who did not have to pay tribute but who supplied ships to the alliance.Thucydides, Peloponnesian War 3.10.\n\nBy the fifth to fourth centuries BC, the island had grown to an estimated population of over 120,000 (two to three times the estimated population in 2005), based on the huge necropolis at the main city of Chios. It is thought that the majority of the population lived in that area.Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 3\n\nIn 412 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, Chios revolted against Athens, and the Athenians besieged it. Relief only came the following year when the Spartans were able to raise the siege. In the 4th century BC, Chios was a member of the Second Athenian Empire but revolted against Athens during the Social War (357–355 BC), and Chios became independent again until the rise of Macedonia.\n\nHellenistic period\n\nTheopompus returned to Chios with the other exiles in 333 BC after Alexander had invaded Asia Minor and decreed their return,[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t75.html A translation of the decree can be viewed online] as well as the exile or trial of Persian supporters on the island. Theopompus was exiled again sometime after Alexander's death and took refuge in Egypt.[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/greek-lit/index.html Anthon, Charles A Manual of Greek Literature, p.251, 1853]\n\nDuring this period, the island also had become the largest exporter of Greek wine, which was noted for being of relatively high quality (see \"Chian wine\"). Chian amphoras, with a characteristic sphinx emblem and bunches of grapes, have been found in nearly every country with whom the ancient Greeks traded. These countries included Gaul, Upper Egypt, and Southern Russia.Hugh Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 41. Simon and Schuster 1989\n\nRoman period\n\nDuring the Third Macedonian War, thirty-five vessels allied to Rome, carrying about 1,000 Galatian troops, as well as a number of horses, were sent by Eumenes II to his brother Attalus.\n\nLeaving from Elaea, they were headed to the harbour of Phanae, planning to disembark from there to Macedonia. However, Perseus's naval commander Antenor intercepted the fleet between Erythrae (on the Western coast of Turkey) and Chios.\n\nAccording to Livy,Livy, 44.28 they were caught completely off-guard by Antenor. Eumenes' officers at first thought the intercepting fleet were friendly Romans, but scattered upon realizing they were facing an attack by their Macedonian enemy, some choosing to abandon ship and swim to Erythrae. Others, crashing their ships into land on Chios, fled toward the city.\n\nThe Chians however closed their gates, startled at the calamity. And the Macedonians, who had docked closer to the city anyway, cut the rest of the fleet off outside the city gates, and on the road leading to the city. Of the 1,000 men, 800 were killed, 200 taken prisoner.'\n\nAfter the Roman conquest Chios became part of the province of Asia.\n\nPliny remarks upon the islanders' use of variegated marble in their buildings, and their appreciation for such stone above murals or other forms of artificial decoration.\n\nAccording to the Acts of the Apostles, Luke the Evangelist, Paul the Apostle and their companions passed Chios during Paul's third missionary journey, on a passage from Lesbos to Samos.\n\nByzantine period\n\nAfter the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Chios was for six centuries part of the Byzantine Empire. This came to an end when the island was briefly held (1090–97) by Tzachas, a Turkish bey in the region of Smyrna during the first expansion of the Turks to the Aegean coast.Brownworth, Lars (2009) Lost to the West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire That Rescued Western Civilization, Crown Publishers, : \"...the Muslims captured Ephesus in 1090 and spread out to the Greek islands.  Chios, Rhodes, and Lesbos fell in quick succession.\" p. 233. However, the Turks were driven back from the Aegean coast by the Byzantines aided by the First Crusade, and the island was restored to Byzantine rule by admiral Constantine Dalassenos.\n\nThis relative stability was ended by the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade (1204) and during the turmoil of the 13th century the island's ownership was constantly affected by the regional power struggles. After the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine empire was divided up by the Latin emperors of Constantinople, with Chios nominally becoming a possession of the Republic of Venice. However, defeats for the Latin empire resulted in the island reverting to Byzantine rule in 1225.\n\nGenoese period (1304–1566)\n\nThe Byzantine rulers had little influence and through the Treaty of Nymphaeum, authority was ceded to the Republic of Genoa (1261).William Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/624735 \"The Zaccaria of Phocaea and Chios. (1275–1329.)\"] The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 31, 1911 (1911), pp. 42–55; . At this time the island was frequently attacked by pirates, and by 1302–1303 was a target for the renewed Turkish fleets. To prevent Turkish expansion, the island was reconquered and kept as a renewable concession, at the behest of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus, by the Genovese Benedetto I Zaccaria (1304), then admiral to Philip of France. Zaccaria installed himself as ruler of the island, founding the short-lived Lordship of Chios. His rule was benign and effective control remained in the hands of the local Greek landowners. Benedetto Zacharia was followed by his son Paleologo and then his grandsons or nephews Benedetto II and Martino. They attempted to turn the island towards the Latin and Papal powers, and away from the predominant Byzantine influence. The locals, still loyal to the Byzantine Empire, responded to a letter from the emperor and, despite a standing army of a thousand infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen and two galleys, expelled the Zacharia family from the island (1329) and dissolved the fiefdom.Arbel, Benjamin, Bernard Hamilton, and David Jacob. Latins and Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204. .\n\nLocal rule was brief. In 1346, a chartered company or Maona (the \"Maona di Chio e di Focea\") was set up in Genoa to reconquer and exploit Chios and the neighbouring town of Phocaea in Asia Minor. Although the islanders firmly rejected an initial offer of protection, the island was invaded by a Genoese fleet, led by Simone Vignoso, and the castle besieged. Again rule was transferred peacefully, as on 12 September the castle was surrendered and a treaty signed with no loss of privileges to the local landowners as long as the new authority was accepted.\n\nThe Genoese, being interested in profit rather than conquest, controlled the trade-posts and warehouses, in particular the trade of mastic, alum, salt and pitch. Other trades such as grain, wine oil and cloth and most professions were run jointly with the locals. After a failed uprising in 1347, and being heavily outnumbered (less than 10% of the population in 1395), the Latins maintained light control over the local population, remaining largely in the town and allowing full religious freedom. In this way the island remained under Genoese control for two centuries. By 1566, when Genoa lost Chios to the Ottoman Empire, there were 12.000 Greeks and 2.500 Genoese (or 17% of the total population) in the island.[http://www.chioshistory.gr/en/itx/itx22.html Chios History] \n\nOttoman period\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, the government and tax gathering again remained in the hands of Greeks and the Turkish garrison was small and inconspicuous.William St. Clair, That Greece Might Still Be Free, The Philhellenes in the War of Independence, Oxford University Press, London, 1972, p.79. .\n\nAs well as the Latin and Turkish influx, documents record a small Jewish population from at least 1049 AD. The original Greek (Romaniote) Jews, thought to have been brought over by the Romans, were later joined by Sephardic Jews welcomed by the Ottomans during the Iberian expulsions of the 15th century.\n\nThe mainstay of the island's famous wealth was the mastic crop. Chios was able to make a substantial contribution to the imperial treasury while at the same time maintaining only a light level of taxation. The Ottoman government regarded it as one of the most valuable provinces of the Empire.William St. Clair, p. 79\n\nModern period\n\nWhen the Greek War of Independence broke out, the island's leaders were reluctant to join the revolutionaries, fearing the loss of their security and prosperity. However, in March 1822, several hundred armed Greeks from the neighbouring island of Samos landed in Chios. They proclaimed the Revolution and launched attacks against the Turks, at which point islanders decided to join the struggle.\n\nOttomans landed a large force on the island consequently and put down the rebellion. The Ottoman massacre of Chios expelled, killed, or enslaved the inhabitants of the island.[http://greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/Genocide/el/2_Events Hellenic Genocide Events]  retrieved 19 May 2008 It wiped out whole villages and affected the Mastichochoria area, the mastic growing villages in the south of the island. It triggered negative public reaction in Western Europe, as portrayed by Eugène Delacroix, and in the writing of Lord Byron and Victor Hugo.\n\nIn 1881, an earthquake, estimated as 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale, damaged a large portion of the island's buildings and resulted in great loss of life. Reports of the time spoke of 5,500–10,000 fatalities.\n\nMeanwhile, Chios during this time emerges as the motherland of the modern Greek shipping industry. Indicatively, in 1764, Chios had 6 vessels with 90 sailors on record, in 1875 there were 104 ships with over 60,000 registered tonnes in 1889 were recorded 440 sailing ships of various types with 3,050 sailors. The dynamic development of Chian shipping in the 19th century is further attested by the various shipping related services that were present in the island during this time, such as the creation of the shipping insurance companies Chiaki Thalssoploia (Χιακή Θαλασσοπλοϊα), Dyo Adelfai (Δυο Αδελφαί), Omonoia (Ομονοια), the shipping bank Archangelos (Αρχάγγελος) (1863). The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong diaspora presence of Chian merchants, the connections they had developed with the financing centers of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.\n\nChios rejoined the rest of independent Greece after the First Balkan War (1912). The Greek Navy liberated Chios in November 1912 in a hard fought but brief amphibious operation. The Ottoman Empire recognized Greece's annexation of Chios and the other Aegean islands by the Treaty of London (1913).\n\nAlthough Greece was neutral the island was occupied by the British during World War I.They landed on 17 February 1916.This may have been due to the island's proximity to the Ottoman Empire and the city of İzmir in particular.\n\nIt was affected by the population exchanges after the Greco–Turkish War of 1919–1922, with the incoming Greek refugees settling in Kastro (previously Turkish) and in new settlements hurriedly built south of Chios Town.\n\nThe island saw some local violence during the Greek Civil War setting neighbour against neighbour.  This ended when the final band of communist fighters was trapped and killed in the orchards of Kambos and their bodies driven through the main town on the back of a truck.  In March 1948, the island was used as an internment camp for female political detainees (communists or relatives of guerillas) and their children, who were housed in military barracks near the town of Chios.  Up to 1300 women and 50 children were housed in cramped and degrading conditions, until March 1949 when the camp was closed and the inhabitants moved to Trikeri.Becoming a Subject: Political Prisoners During the Greek Civil War: Polymeris Voglis, Published 2002Berghahn Books \n\nThe production of mastic was threatened by the Chios forest fire that swept the southern half of the island in August 2012 and destroyed some mastic groves.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Chios has a permanent resident population of 52,674.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe present municipality Chios was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 8 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n*Agios Minas\n*Amani\n*Chios (town)\n*Ionia\n*Kampochora\n*Kardamyla\n*Mastichochoria\n*Omiroupoli\n\nEconomy\n\nCommerce\n\nThe local merchant shipping community transports several locally grown products including mastic, olives, figs, wine, mandarins, and cherries.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the island include:\n*kordelia\n*malathropita\n*sfougato\n*mamoulia (dessert)\n*masourakia (dessert)\n*mastichato (drink)\n\nAntimony Mines \n\nSporadically for some time at early 19th century to 1950s there was mining activity on the island at Keramos Antimony Mines.\n\nCulture\n\n*Nea Moni is a monastery with fine mosaics from Constantine IX's reign and a World Heritage Site.[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/212/21203n/e212cn01.html ] \n*An ancient inscription (at Chios Archaeological Museum) from a fifth-century funerary monument for Heropythos the son of Philaios, traced his family back over fourteen generations to Kyprios at the tenth century BC, before there were any written records in Greece.A Corpus of the Inscriptions of Chios (IG XII 6.3)\n;Forts\n*Castle of Chios, a Byzantine fort built in the 10th century\n**St. George's church\n\n;Museums\n*Chios Byzantine Museum\n*Archaeological Museum of Chios\n\n;Traditions\n*The town of Vrontados is home to a unique Easter celebration, where competing teams of locals gather at the town's two (rival) churches to fire tens of thousands of homemade rockets at the other church's bell tower while the Easter service is going on inside the churches, in what has become known as rouketopolemos.\n\n;Sports\n*F.C.
