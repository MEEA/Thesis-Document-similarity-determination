  "textBody" : "The foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of its population, and its reliance on commerce and trade. Until 2005, Lebanon's foreign policy had been heavily influenced by Syria.  The framework for relations was first codified in May 1991, when Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of mutual cooperation. This treaty came out of the Taif Agreement, which stipulated that \"Lebanon is linked to Syria by distinctive ties deriving strength from kinship, history, and common interests.\" The Lebanese-Syria treaty calls for \"coordination and cooperation between the two countries\" that would serve the \"interests of the two countries within the framework of sovereignty and independence of each.\" Numerous agreements on political, economic, security, and judicial affairs have followed over the years.\n\nAfter Syria's military withdrawal in 2005, Lebanon's foreign policy charted a more independent course.  Although its current government's policy can be considered Western-leaning if not pro-Western, the political opposition led by Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement advocate a foreign policy more in line with that of Iran and Syria.\n\nAsia\n\nLebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is in the process of accession to the World Trade Organization. Lebanon traditionally enjoys warm relations with other pro-Western Arab states.  At various times, however, it has seen tension with Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, and Libya.  In March 2002, in honor of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the South of the country,  the Arab League met in Lebanon for the first time since 1967.  Lebanon also is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
