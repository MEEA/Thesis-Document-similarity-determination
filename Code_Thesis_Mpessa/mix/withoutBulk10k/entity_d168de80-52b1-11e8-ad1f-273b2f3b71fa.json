Individuals who profess to be \"born again\" often state that they have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The phrase \"born again\" is also used as an adjective to describe individual members of the movement who espouse this belief, as well as the movement itself (\"born-again Christian\" and the \"born-again movement\").\n\nOrigin\n\nThe term is derived from an event in the New Testament in which the words of Jesus were not understood by a Jewish pharisee, Nicodemus.\n\nThe Greek phrase in the text is ambiguous, resulting in a wordplay in which \"born again\" is rendered as \"born from above\" in some translations such as the NET and the NRSV.\n\nThe King James Version uses the phrase born again three times, two of them in chapter 3 of the Gospel of John when Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus.\n\nJohn's Gospel was written in Greek, and the word translated as again is ἄνωθεν (ánōtʰen), which could mean again, or from above. The New Revised Standard Version prefers this latter translation, and both the King James Version and the Revised Version give it as an alternative in the margins. Hoskyns argues that it is to be preferred as the fundamental meaning and he drew attention to phrases such as \"birth of the Spirit ()\", \"birth from God (cf. ; , , , )\" but maintains that this necessarily carries with it an emphasis upon the newness of the life as given by God himself.Hoskyns, Sir Edwyn C. and Davy, F.N.(ed), The Fourth Gospel, Faber & Faber 2nd ed. 1947, pp. 211,212\n\nThe final use of the phrase occurs in the First Epistle of Peter, rendered in the King James Version as:\n\nHere, the Greek word translated as \"born again\" is  ().Fisichella, SJ., Taking Away the Veil: To See Beyond the Curtain of Illusion, iUniverse, 2003, pp. 55-56.\n\nInterpretations\n\nThe traditional Jewish understanding of the promise of salvation is interpreted as being rooted in \"the seed of Abraham\"; that is, physical lineage from Abraham. Jesus explained to Nicodemus that this doctrine was in error—that every person must have two births—natural birth of the physical body and another of the water and the spirit.Emmons, Samuel B. A Bible Dictionary. BiblioLife, 2008. .

Theologian Frank Stagg cites two reasons why the newer translation is significant:\n# The emphasis \"from above\" (implying \"from Heaven\") calls attention to the source of the \"newness of life\".

For ... a man should not be happy who is not holy.\" Also, \"I say, [a man] may be born again and so become an heir of salvation.\" Wesley also states infants who are baptized are born again, but for adults it is different:\n\nThe quotation from the Gospel of John has raised some questions about the meaning and authenticity of the phrase \"born again\". In the chapter, Nicodemus is puzzled and asks Jesus what he means by saying that \"Ye must be born again\". He questions: \"How can a man re-enter his mother's womb?\" Scholar Bart D. Ehrman says that this confusion is because in Greek (the language of the gospel) the word again is ambiguous. It might mean again or a second time or from above, which would explain Nicodemus' confusion. However, the Jews at Jesus' time were actually speaking Aramaic, in which there would not have been a double meaning. Ehrman says that this raises questions about the authenticity of the dialogue, the meaning of the words, and, therefore, the use of the phrase.Ehrman, B.D., Referred to in Edward T. Babinski The \"Born Again\" Dialogue in the Gospel of John (Another Reason To Doubt Its Authenticity) from http://etb-biblical-errancy.blogspot.com/2012/04/born-again-dialogue-in-gospel-of-john.html Accessed 25 February 2011.\n\nA 19th-century source notes that the phrase was not mentioned by the other Evangelists, nor by the Apostles except Peter. \"It was not regarded by any of the Evangelists but John of sufficient importance to record.\" It adds that without John, \"we should hardly have known that it was necessary for one to be born again.\" This suggests that \"the text and context was meant to apply to Nicodemus particularly, and not to the world.\"LeFevre, CF. and Williamson, ID., The Gospel anchor. Troy, NY, 1831–32, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id3T4rAAAAYAAJ&source\ngbs_navlinks_s]\n\nDenominational positions\n\nThe Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics notes: \"The GSS ... has asked a born-again question on three occasions ... 'Would you say you have been 'born again' or have had a 'born-again' experience?\" The Handbook says that \"Evangelical, black, and Latino Protestants tend to respond similarly, with about two-thirds of each group answering in the affirmative. In contrast, only about one third of mainline Protestants and one sixth of Catholics (Anglo and Latino) claim a born-again experience.\" However, the handbook suggests that \"born-again questions are poor measures even for capturing evangelical respondents. ... it is likely that people who report a born-again experience also claim it as an identity.\"The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics, OUP, p16.\n\nCatholicism\n\nUse of the term \"born again\" in Catholicism to refer to Christian conversion is modern, presumably developing out of the teachings of John Wesley and popularized in the ministry of 19th century tent meeting revivalists such as Billy Sunday, and Dwight L. Moody. Individuals were encouraged to change their lives and 'come to Jesus'. Even with these early revivalists, the use of the term \"born again\" to describe this experience of conversion was still not widespread.\n\nHistorically, the classic text from John 3 was consistently interpreted by the early church fathers as a reference to baptism.Joel C. Elworthy, Ed. Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament IVa, John 1-10, (Downers Grove: Intervarsity Press,2007), p. 109-110 Modern Catholic interpreters have noted that the phrase 'born from above' or 'born again' (John 3:3) is clarified as 'being born of water and Spirit' (John 3:5).\n\nCatholic commentator John F. McHugh notes, \"Rebirth, and the commencement of this new life, are said to come about ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος, of water and spirit. This phrase (without the article), refers to a rebirth which the early Church regarded as taking place through baptism (1 Pet 1.3, 23; Tit 3.5).\"John F. McHugh, John 1-4, The International Critical Commentary, (New York: T&T Clark,2009), p. 227\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that the essential elements of Christian initiation are: \"proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic communion\" (CCC 1229). Baptism gives the person the grace of forgiveness for all prior sins; it makes the newly baptized person a new creature and an adopted son of God (2 Corinthians 5:17; 2 Peter 1:4); it incorporates them into the Body of Christ (Ephesians 4:25) and creates a sacramental bond of unity leaving an indelible mark on our souls (CCC 1262-1274). \"Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated\" (CCC 1272). The Holy Spirit is involved with each aspect of the movement of grace. \"The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion. ... Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high\" (CCC 1989).\n\nThe Catholic Church also teaches that under special circumstances the need for water baptism can be superseded by the Holy Spirit in a 'baptism of desire', such as when catechumens die or are martyred prior to receiving baptism (CCC 1260).\n\nPope John Paul II wrote about \"the problem of children baptized in infancy [who] come for catechesis in the parish without receiving any other initiation into the faith and still without any explicit personal attachment to Jesus Christ\" (Catechesi Tradendae 19). He noted that \"being a Christian means saying 'yes' to Jesus Christ, but let us remember that this 'yes' has two levels: It consists of surrendering to the word of God and relying on it, but it also means, at a later stage, endeavoring to know better—and better the profound meaning of this word\" (CT 20).\n\nThe modern expression being \"born again\" is really about the concept of \"conversion\".\n\t\nThe National Directory of Catechesis (published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB) defines conversion as, \"the acceptance of a personal relationship with Christ, a sincere adherence to him, and a willingness to conform one's life to his.\"United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory of Catechesis (2005) p. 48 To put it more simply \"Conversion to Christ involves making a genuine commitment to him and a personal decision to follow him as his disciple.\"\n \t\nEchoing the writings of Pope John Paul II, the National Directory of Catechesis describes a new intervention required by our modern world called the \"New Evangelization\". The New Evangelization is directed to the Church herself, to the baptized who were never effectively evangelized before, to those who have never made a personal commitment to Christ and the Gospel, to those formed by the values of the secular culture, to those who have lost a sense of faith, and to those who are alienatedUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory of Catechesis (2005) p. 47\n\nDeclan O'Sullivan, co-founder of the Catholic Men's Fellowship and knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, wrote that the \"New Evangelization emphasizes the personal encounter with Jesus Christ as a pre-condition for spreading the gospel. The born-again experience is not just an emotional, mystical high; the really important matter is what happened in the convert's life after the moment or period of radical change.\"\n\nLutheranism\n\nLutheranism holds that \"we are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost. But she also teaches that whoever is baptized must, through daily contrition and repentance, drown The Old Adam so that daily a new man come forth and arise who walks before God in righteousness and purity forever. She teaches that whoever lives in sins after his baptism has again lost the grace of baptism.\"\n\nAnglicanism\n\nThe phrase born again is mentioned in the 39 Articles of the Anglican Church in article XV, entitled \"Of Christ alone without Sin\". In part, it reads: \"sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html] Accessed 8 April 2012.\n\nAlthough the phrase \"baptized and born again in Christ\" occurs in Article XV, the reference is clearly to the scripture passage in John 3:3.[http://www.ccepiscopal.org/handouts/bcp-1662.pdf] Surely it is anachronistic to read back into this the modern understanding? The phrase consistently referred to baptism in the early Church.See Catholic section of this article\n\nReformed\n\nAccording to the Reformed churches being born again refers to \"the inward working of the Spirit which induces the sinner to respond to the effectual call\". According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q 88, \"the outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of redemption are, his ordinances, especially the word, sacraments, and prayer; all of which are made effectual to the elect for salvation.\"[http://www.shortercatechism.com/resources/wsc/wsc_088.html] Effectual calling is \"the work of God's Spirit, whereby, convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing our wills, he doth persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us in the gospel.\"Shorter Westminster Catechism, Question 31.\":\n\nIn Reformed theology, \"regeneration precedes faith.\" Samuel Storms writes that, \"Calvinists insist that the sole cause of regeneration or being born again is the will of God. God first sovereignly and efficaciously regenerates, and only in consequence of that do we act. Therefore, the individual is passive in regeneration, neither preparing himself nor making himself receptive to what God will do. Regeneration is a change wrought in us by God, not an autonomous act performed by us for ourselves.\"\n\nMethodism\n\nIn Methodism, the \"new birth is necessary for salvation because it marks the move toward holiness. That comes with faith.\" John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, held that the New Birth \"is that great change which God works in the soul when he brings it into life, when he raises it from the death of sin to the life of righteousness\" (Works, vol. 2, pp. 193–194). The Articles of Religion, in Article XVII—Of Baptism, state that baptism is a \"sign of regeneration or the new birth.\" The Methodist Visitor in describing this doctrine, admonishes individuals: \"'Ye must be born again.' Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'\"\n\nEvangelicalism\n\nBelief in the New Birth is an essential and distinctive element of Evangelical Christianity.Brian Stiller, Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century, Éditions Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 34Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2002, p. 236Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff, An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies, Liturgical Press, USA, 2007, p.  425 For Evangelical Christians, the new birth always occurs before baptism.Michael J. Meiring, Preserving Evangelical Unity: Welcoming Diversity in Non-Essentials, Wipf and Stock Publishers , USA, 2009, p. 117 For some churches, it is synonymous with the Baptism with the Holy Spirit; however, it is considered a distinct experience in Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Movement, and the Neo-charismatic movement.Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 184Veli-Matti Karkkainen, The Spirit in the World: Emerging Pentecostal Theologies in Global Contexts, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 2009, p. 39\n\n\"Although many evangelicals allow that conversion can be a process, generally they see it as a specific, identifiable moment of time when a person simply and sincerely trusts in Jesus Christ as savior.\"Mullen, MS., in Kurian, GT., The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization, J. Wiley & Sons, 2012, p. 302. They understand  to indicate a requirement of salvation: \"That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\" So, \"to be born again\" means \"to be saved\" because to be saved, one must confess Jesus is Lord with one's mouth and believe it in one's heart. Also, to be born again means to follow  that \"with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved\".Graham, RC. I healed you with my word, Xulan, 2007, p. 414.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that individuals do not have the power to choose to be born again, but that God calls and selects his followers \"from above\". Only those belonging to the \"144,000\" are considered to be born again.\n\nDisagreements between denominations\n\nThe term \"born again\" is used by several Christian denominations, but there are disagreements on what the term means, and whether members of other denominations are justified in claiming to be born-again Christians.\n\nA Catholic website says:\n\nOn the other hand, an Evangelical site argues:\n\nThe Reformed view of regeneration may be set apart from other outlooks in at least two ways. \n\nHistory and usage\n\nHistorically, Christianity has used various metaphors to describe its rite of initiation, that is, spiritual regeneration via the sacrament of baptism by the power of the water and the spirit. This remains the common understanding in most of Christendom, held, for example, in Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Anglicanism,See the section on Anglicanism in Baptismal regeneration Lutheranism, and in much of Protestantism. However, sometime after the Reformation, Evangelicalism attributed greater significance to the expression born again\"born-again.\" Good Word Guide. London: A&C Black, 2007. Credo Reference. 30 July 2009 as an experience of religious conversion (), symbolized by deep-water baptism, and rooted in a commitment to one's own personal faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. This same belief is, historically, also an integral part of Methodist doctrine, and is connected with the doctrine of Justification.\n\nAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nAccording to J. Gordon Melton:\n\nAccording to Andrew Purves and Charles Partee:\n\nThe term born again has become widely associated with the evangelical Christian renewal since the late 1960s, first in the United States and then around the world. Associated perhaps initially with Jesus People and the Christian counterculture, born again came to refer to a conversion experience, accepting Jesus Christ as lord and savior in order to be saved from hell and given eternal life with God in heaven, and was increasingly used as a term to identify devout believers. By the mid-1970s, born again Christians were increasingly referred to in the mainstream media as part of the born again movement.\n\nIn 1976, Watergate conspirator Chuck Colson's book Born Again gained international notice. Time magazine named him \"One of the 25 most influential Evangelicals in America.\"[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050207/photoessay/5.html The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America.]  The term was sufficiently prevalent so that during the year's presidential campaign, Democratic party nominee Jimmy Carter described himself as \"born again\" in the first Playboy magazine interview of an American presidential candidate.\n\nColson describes his path to faith in conjunction with his criminal imprisonment and played a significant role in solidifying the \"born again\" identity as a cultural construct in the US. He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a \"personal encounter with God.\" He recalls:\n\nJimmy Carter was the first President of the United States to publicly declare that he was born-again, in 1976.Hough, JF., Changing party coalitions, Algora Publishing, 2006, p. 203. By the 1980 campaign, all three major candidates stated that they had been born again.Utter, GH. and Tru, JL.,Conservative Christians and political participation: a reference handbook, ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 137.\n\nSider and KnippersSider, J. and Knippers, D. (eds), Toward an Evangelical Public Policy: Political Strategies for the Health of the Nation, Baker Books, 2005, p.51. state that \"Ronald Reagan's election that fall [was] aided by the votes of 61% of 'born-again' white Protestants.\"\n\nThe Gallup Organization reported that \"In 2003, 42% of U.S. adults said they were born-again or evangelical; the 2004 percentage is 41%\" and that, \"Black Americans are far more likely to identify themselves as born-again or evangelical, with 63% of blacks saying they are born-again, compared with 39% of white Americans. Republicans are far more likely to say they are born-again (52%) than Democrats (36%) or independents (32%).\"\n\nHaiven refers to \"born-agains\" as having \"a type of intolerance\". She says, \"The instant and thoughtless panaceas of born-again Christianity will be seen as a vast sanctuary by millions of North Americans.\" She continues, \"Is this sanctuary really a recruitment camp for right-wing movements? It would be naive to think otherwise.\"Haiven, J., Faith, hope, no charity: an inside look at the born again movement in Canada and the United States, New Star Books, 1984, p.218.\n\nThe Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics, referring to several studies, reports \"that 'born-again' identification is associated with lower support for government anti-poverty programs.\" It also notes that \"self-reported born-again\" Christianity, \"strongly shapes attitudes towards economic policy.\"Smidt, C., Kellstedt, L., and Guth, J., The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics, Oxford Handbooks Online, 2009, pp.195-196.\n\nNames inspired by the term\n\nThe idea of  \"rebirth in Christ\" has inspiredOxford Dictionary of First Names some common European forenames: French René/Renée, Dutch Renaat/Renate, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese Renato/Renata, Latin Renatus/Renata, which all mean \"reborn\", \"born again\".Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary, W. & R.

Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament IVa, John 1-10, (Downers Grove: Intervarsity Press,2007), p. 109-110 Modern Catholic interpreters have noted that the phrase 'born from above' or 'born again' (John 3:3) is clarified as 'being born of water and Spirit' (John 3:5).\n\nCatholic commentator John F. McHugh notes, \"Rebirth, and the commencement of this new life, are said to come about ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος, of water and spirit. This phrase (without the article), refers to a rebirth which the early Church regarded as taking place through baptism (1 Pet 1.3, 23; Tit 3.5).\"John F. McHugh, John 1-4, The International Critical Commentary, (New York: T&T Clark,2009), p. 227\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that the essential elements of Christian initiation are: \"proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic communion\" (CCC 1229). Baptism gives the person the grace of forgiveness for all prior sins; it makes the newly baptized person a new creature and an adopted son of God (2 Corinthians 5:17; 2 Peter 1:4); it incorporates them into the Body of Christ (Ephesians 4:25) and creates a sacramental bond of unity leaving an indelible mark on our souls (CCC 1262-1274). \"Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated\" (CCC 1272). The Holy Spirit is involved with each aspect of the movement of grace. \"The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion. ... Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high\" (CCC 1989).\n\nThe Catholic Church also teaches that under special circumstances the need for water baptism can be superseded by the Holy Spirit in a 'baptism of desire', such as when catechumens die or are martyred prior to receiving baptism (CCC 1260).\n\nPope John Paul II wrote about \"the problem of children baptized in infancy [who] come for catechesis in the parish without receiving any other initiation into the faith and still without any explicit personal attachment to Jesus Christ\" (Catechesi Tradendae 19). He noted that \"being a Christian means saying 'yes' to Jesus Christ, but let us remember that this 'yes' has two levels: It consists of surrendering to the word of God and relying on it, but it also means, at a later stage, endeavoring to know better—and better the profound meaning of this word\" (CT 20).\n\nThe modern expression being \"born again\" is really about the concept of \"conversion\".\n\t\nThe National Directory of Catechesis (published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB) defines conversion as, \"the acceptance of a personal relationship with Christ, a sincere adherence to him, and a willingness to conform one's life to his.\"United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory of Catechesis (2005) p. 48 To put it more simply \"Conversion to Christ involves making a genuine commitment to him and a personal decision to follow him as his disciple.\"\n \t\nEchoing the writings of Pope John Paul II, the National Directory of Catechesis describes a new intervention required by our modern world called the \"New Evangelization\". The New Evangelization is directed to the Church herself, to the baptized who were never effectively evangelized before, to those who have never made a personal commitment to Christ and the Gospel, to those formed by the values of the secular culture, to those who have lost a sense of faith, and to those who are alienatedUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory of Catechesis (2005) p. 47\n\nDeclan O'Sullivan, co-founder of the Catholic Men's Fellowship and knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, wrote that the \"New Evangelization emphasizes the personal encounter with Jesus Christ as a pre-condition for spreading the gospel. The born-again experience is not just an emotional, mystical high; the really important matter is what happened in the convert's life after the moment or period of radical change.\"\n\nLutheranism\n\nLutheranism holds that \"we are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost. But she also teaches that whoever is baptized must, through daily contrition and repentance, drown The Old Adam so that daily a new man come forth and arise who walks before God in righteousness and purity forever. She teaches that whoever lives in sins after his baptism has again lost the grace of baptism.\"\n\nAnglicanism\n\nThe phrase born again is mentioned in the 39 Articles of the Anglican Church in article XV, entitled \"Of Christ alone without Sin\". In part, it reads: \"sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html] Accessed 8 April 2012.\n\nAlthough the phrase \"baptized and born again in Christ\" occurs in Article XV, the reference is clearly to the scripture passage in John 3:3.[http://www.ccepiscopal.org/handouts/bcp-1662.pdf] Surely it is anachronistic to read back into this the modern understanding? The phrase consistently referred to baptism in the early Church.See Catholic section of this article\n\nReformed\n\nAccording to the Reformed churches being born again refers to \"the inward working of the Spirit which induces the sinner to respond to the effectual call\". According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q 88, \"the outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of redemption are, his ordinances, especially the word, sacraments, and prayer; all of which are made effectual to the elect for salvation.\"[http://www.shortercatechism.com/resources/wsc/wsc_088.html] Effectual calling is \"the work of God's Spirit, whereby, convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing our wills, he doth persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us in the gospel.\"Shorter Westminster Catechism, Question 31.\":\n\nIn Reformed theology, \"regeneration precedes faith.\" Samuel Storms writes that, \"Calvinists insist that the sole cause of regeneration or being born again is the will of God. God first sovereignly and efficaciously regenerates, and only in consequence of that do we act. Therefore, the individual is passive in regeneration, neither preparing himself nor making himself receptive to what God will do. Regeneration is a change wrought in us by God, not an autonomous act performed by us for ourselves.\"\n\nMethodism\n\nIn Methodism, the \"new birth is necessary for salvation because it marks the move toward holiness. That comes with faith.\" John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, held that the New Birth \"is that great change which God works in the soul when he brings it into life, when he raises it from the death of sin to the life of righteousness\" (Works, vol. 2, pp. 193–194). The Articles of Religion, in Article XVII—Of Baptism, state that baptism is a \"sign of regeneration or the new birth.\" The Methodist Visitor in describing this doctrine, admonishes individuals: \"'Ye must be born again.' Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'\"\n\nEvangelicalism\n\nBelief in the New Birth is an essential and distinctive element of Evangelical Christianity.Brian Stiller, Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century, Éditions Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 34Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2002, p. 236Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff, An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies, Liturgical Press, USA, 2007, p.  425 For Evangelical Christians, the new birth always occurs before baptism.Michael J. Meiring, Preserving Evangelical Unity: Welcoming Diversity in Non-Essentials, Wipf and Stock Publishers , USA, 2009, p. 117 For some churches, it is synonymous with the Baptism with the Holy Spirit; however, it is considered a distinct experience in Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Movement, and the Neo-charismatic movement.Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 184Veli-Matti Karkkainen, The Spirit in the World: Emerging Pentecostal Theologies in Global Contexts, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 2009, p. 39\n\n\"Although many evangelicals allow that conversion can be a process, generally they see it as a specific, identifiable moment of time when a person simply and sincerely trusts in Jesus Christ as savior.\"Mullen, MS., in Kurian, GT., The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization, J. Wiley & Sons, 2012, p. 302. They understand  to indicate a requirement of salvation: \"That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\" So, \"to be born again\" means \"to be saved\" because to be saved, one must confess Jesus is Lord with one's mouth and believe it in one's heart. Also, to be born again means to follow  that \"with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved\".Graham, RC. I healed you with my word, Xulan, 2007, p. 414.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that individuals do not have the power to choose to be born again, but that God calls and selects his followers \"from above\". Only those belonging to the \"144,000\" are considered to be born again.\n\nDisagreements between denominations\n\nThe term \"born again\" is used by several Christian denominations, but there are disagreements on what the term means, and whether members of other denominations are justified in claiming to be born-again Christians.\n\nA Catholic website says:\n\nOn the other hand, an Evangelical site argues:\n\nThe Reformed view of regeneration may be set apart from other outlooks in at least two ways. \n\nHistory and usage\n\nHistorically, Christianity has used various metaphors to describe its rite of initiation, that is, spiritual regeneration via the sacrament of baptism by the power of the water and the spirit. This remains the common understanding in most of Christendom, held, for example, in Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Anglicanism,See the section on Anglicanism in Baptismal regeneration Lutheranism, and in much of Protestantism. However, sometime after the Reformation, Evangelicalism attributed greater significance to the expression born again\"born-again.\" Good Word Guide. London: A&C Black, 2007. Credo Reference. 30 July 2009 as an experience of religious conversion (), symbolized by deep-water baptism, and rooted in a commitment to one's own personal faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. This same belief is, historically, also an integral part of Methodist doctrine, and is connected with the doctrine of Justification.\n\nAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nAccording to J. Gordon Melton:\n\nAccording to Andrew Purves and Charles Partee:\n\nThe term born again has become widely associated with the evangelical Christian renewal since the late 1960s, first in the United States and then around the world. Associated perhaps initially with Jesus People and the Christian counterculture, born again came to refer to a conversion experience, accepting Jesus Christ as lord and savior in order to be saved from hell and given eternal life with God in heaven, and was increasingly used as a term to identify devout believers. By the mid-1970s, born again Christians were increasingly referred to in the mainstream media as part of the born again movement.\n\nIn 1976, Watergate conspirator Chuck Colson's book Born Again gained international notice. Time magazine named him \"One of the 25 most influential Evangelicals in America.\"[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050207/photoessay/5.html The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America.]  The term was sufficiently prevalent so that during the year's presidential campaign, Democratic party nominee Jimmy Carter described himself as \"born again\" in the first Playboy magazine interview of an American presidential candidate.\n\nColson describes his path to faith in conjunction with his criminal imprisonment and played a significant role in solidifying the \"born again\" identity as a cultural construct in the US. He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a \"personal encounter with God.\" He recalls:\n\nJimmy Carter was the first President of the United States to publicly declare that he was born-again, in 1976.Hough, JF., Changing party coalitions, Algora Publishing, 2006, p. 203. By the 1980 campaign, all three major candidates stated that they had been born again.Utter, GH. and Tru, JL.,Conservative Christians and political participation: a reference handbook, ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 137.\n\nSider and KnippersSider, J. and Knippers, D. (eds), Toward an Evangelical Public Policy: Political Strategies for the Health of the Nation, Baker Books, 2005, p.51. state that \"Ronald Reagan's election that fall [was] aided by the votes of 61% of 'born-again' white Protestants.\"\n\nThe Gallup Organization reported that \"In 2003, 42% of U.S. adults said they were born-again or evangelical; the 2004 percentage is 41%\" and that, \"Black Americans are far more likely to identify themselves as born-again or evangelical, with 63% of blacks saying they are born-again, compared with 39% of white Americans. Republicans are far more likely to say they are born-again (52%) than Democrats (36%) or independents (32%).\"\n\nHaiven refers to \"born-agains\" as having \"a type of intolerance\". She says, \"The instant and thoughtless panaceas of born-again Christianity will be seen as a vast sanctuary by millions of North Americans.\" She continues, \"Is this sanctuary really a recruitment camp for right-wing movements? It would be naive to think otherwise.\"Haiven, J., Faith, hope, no charity: an inside look at the born again movement in Canada and the United States, New Star Books, 1984, p.218.\n\nThe Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics, referring to several studies, reports \"that 'born-again' identification is associated with lower support for government anti-poverty programs.\" It also notes that \"self-reported born-again\" Christianity, \"strongly shapes attitudes towards economic policy.\"Smidt, C., Kellstedt, L., and Guth, J., The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics, Oxford Handbooks Online, 2009, pp.195-196.\n\nNames inspired by the term\n\nThe idea of  \"rebirth in Christ\" has inspiredOxford Dictionary of First Names some common European forenames: French René/Renée, Dutch Renaat/Renate, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese Renato/Renata, Latin Renatus/Renata, which all mean \"reborn\", \"born again\".Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary, W. & R.
