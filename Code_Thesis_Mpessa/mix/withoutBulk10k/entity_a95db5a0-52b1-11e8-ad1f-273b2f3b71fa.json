  "textBody" : "André Paul Guillaume Gide (; 22 November 1869 – 19 February 1951) was a French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947 \"for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight\".https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/ Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the symbolist movement, to the advent of anticolonialism between the two World Wars. The author of \"more than fifty books\", at the time of his death the New York Times obituary described him as \"France's greatest contemporary man of letters\" and \"judged the greatest French writer of this century by the literary cognoscenti.\"[http://www.andregide.org/remembrance/nytgide.html André Gide Is Dead: Noted Novelist, 81,] \n\nKnown for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced traducing of education and a narrow social moralism. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR.\n\nEarly life\n\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class Protestant family. His father was a Paris University professor of law who died in 1880. His uncle was the political economist Charles Gide. His paternal family traced its roots back to Italy, with his ancestors, the Guido's, moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Protestantism during the 16th century, due to persecution.Wallace Fowlie, André Gide: His Life and Art, Macmillan (1965), p. 11Pierre de Boisdeffre, Vie d'André Gide, 1869-1951: André Gide avant la fondation de la Nouvelle revue française (1869-1909), Hachette (1970), p. 29Jean Delay, La jeunesse d'André Gide, Gallimard (1956), p. 55\n\nGide was brought up in isolated conditions in Normandy and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, The Notebooks of André Walter (French: Les Cahiers d'André Walter), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, Gide travelled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir by André Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"but when Ali – that was my little guide's name – led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country...As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back...I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation\"...\"I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.\" [p. 251]\n\nHe befriended Oscar Wilde in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in Algiers. Wilde had the impression that he had introduced Gide to homosexuality, but, in fact, Gide had already discovered this on his own.Out of the past, Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the present (Miller 1995:87)If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir by André Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"I should say that if Wilde had begun to discover the secrets of his life to me, he knew nothing as yet of mine; I had taken care to give him no hint of them, either by deed or word....No doubt, since my adventure at Sousse, there was not much left for the Adversary to do to complete his victory over me; but Wilde did not know this, nor that I was vanquished beforehand or, if you will...that I had already triumphed in my imagination and my thoughts over all my scruples.\" [p. 286])\n\nThe middle years\n\nIn 1895, after his mother's death, he married his cousin Madeleine Rondeaux,http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/andre-gide1869-1951/ but the marriage remained unconsummated. In 1896, he became mayor of La Roque-Baignard, a commune in Normandy.\n\nIn 1901, Gide rented the property Maderia in St. Brélade's Bay and lived there while residing in Jersey. This period, 1901–07, is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him.\n\nIn 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine Nouvelle Revue Française (The New French Review).[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html André Gide Biography]. nobelprize.org In 1916, Marc Allégret, only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son – one of five children – of Elie Allégret, who years before had been hired by Gide's mother to tutor her son in light of his weak grades in school, after which he and Gide became fast friends; Allégret was best man at Gide's wedding. Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence – \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented. In 1918, he met Dorothy Bussy, who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.\n\nIn the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1923, he published a book on Fyodor Dostoyevsky; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of Corydon (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter Théo van Rysselberghe. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allégret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman,http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n24/edmund-white/on-the-chance-that-a-shepherd-boy- and it was brief in the extreme. Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth \"La Dame Blanche\" (\"The White Lady\"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938. Later he explored their unconsummated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine, Et Nunc Manet in Te.\n\nIn 1924, he published an autobiography, If it Die... (French: Si le grain ne meurt).\n\nIn the same year, he produced the first French language editions of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim.\n\nAfter 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.\n\nAfrica\n\nFrom July 1926 to May 1927, he travelled through the French Equatorial Africa colony with his lover Marc Allégret. Gide went successively to Middle Congo (now the Republic of the Congo), Ubangi-Shari (now the Central African Republic), briefly to Chad and then to Cameroon before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called Travels in the Congo (French: Voyage au Congo) and Return from Chad (French: Retour du Tchad). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform.https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html In particular, he strongly criticized the Large Concessions regime (French: régime des Grandes Concessions), i.e., a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's natural resources, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to slavery. The book had important influence on anti-colonialism movements in France and helped re-evaluate the impact of colonialism.[http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC31184/idR\n219/idTC3/idG\n2 Voyage au Congo suivi du Retour du Tchad]  , in Lire, July–August 1995 \n\nRussia\n\nDuring the 1930s, he briefly became a communist, or more precisely, a fellow traveler (he never formally joined the Communist Party). As a distinguished writer sympathizing with the cause of communism, he was invited to tour the Soviet Union as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers. The tour disillusioned him and he subsequently became quite critical of Soviet communism. This criticism of communism caused him to lose socialist friends, especially when he made a clean break with it in Retour de L'U.R.S.S. in 1936. He was also a contributor to The God That Failed.\n\nMy faith in communism is like my faith in religion: it is a promise of salvation for mankind. If I have to lay my life down that it may succeed, I would do so without hesitation.—André Gide, The God That Failed\n\n...and after his visit to the Soviet Union:André Gide as [http://www.heggy.org/books/imperative/chapter_8.htm quoted by T. Heggy]  in his book Culture, Civilization, and Humanity (2003). \n\nIt is impermissible under any circumstances for morals to sink as low as communism has done. No one can begin to imagine the tragedy of humanity, of morality, of religion and of freedoms in the land of communism, where man has been debased beyond belief.—André Gide, quoted in Culture, Civilization, and Humanity\n\nIn my opinion, in no country today, not even in Hitler’s Germany, is the spirit more suppressed, more timid, more servile than in the Soviet Union.—André Gide\n\n1930s and 1940s\n\nIn 1930 Gide published a book about the Blanche Monnier case called La Séquestrée de Poitiers, changing little but the names of the protagonists. Monnier was a young woman who was kept captive by her own mother for more than 25 years.Pujolas, Marie. En tournage, un documentaire sur l'incroyable affaire de \"La séquestrée de Poitiers\".

In 1947, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He devoted much of his last years to publishing his Journal. Gide died in Paris on 19 February 1951. The Roman Catholic Church placed his works on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1952.[http://www.leninimports.com/andre_gide.html André Gide Biography (1869–1951)]. eninimports.com\n\nGide’s life as a writer\n\nGide’s biographer Alan Sheridan summed up Gide’s life as a writer and an intellectual:\n\n\"Gide was, by general consent, one of the dozen most important writers of the 20th century. Moreover, no writer of such stature had led such an interesting life, a life accessibly interesting to us as readers of his autobiographical writings, his journal, his voluminous correspondence and the testimony of others. It was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation, but reflecting on that process in his journal, reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them; a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in Germany and England; who found daily nourishment in the Latin, French, English and German classics, and, for much of his life, in the Bible; [who enjoyed playing Chopin and other classic works on the piano;] and who engaged in commenting on the moral, political and sexual questions of the day.\"André Gide: A Life in the Present by Alan Sheridan. Harvard University Press, 1999, pages p. xvi.\n\n“Gide’s fame rested ultimately, of course, on his literary works. But, unlike many writers, he was no recluse: he had a need of friendship and a genius for sustaining it.”Alan Sheridan, p. xii. But his “capacity for love was not confined to his friends: it spilled over into a concern for others less fortunate than himself.”Alan Sheridan, p. 624.\n\nWritings\n\nAndré Gide’s writings spanned many genres – “As a master of prose narrative, occasional dramatist and translator, literary critic, letter writer, essayist, and diarist, André Gide provided twentieth-century French literature with one of its most intriguing examples of the man of letters.”Article on André Gide in Contemporary Authors Online’ 2003. Retrieved with library card October 2014.\n\nBut as Gide’s biographer Alan Sheridan points out, “It is the fiction that lies at the summit of Gide’s work.”Information in this paragraph is extracted from André Gide: A Life in the Present by Alan Sheridan, pp. 629-33. \"Here, as in the oeuvre as a whole, what strikes one first is the variety. Here, too, we see Gide’s curiosity, his youthfulness, at work: a refusal to mine only one seam, to repeat successful formulas...The fiction spans the early years of Symbolism, to the “comic, more inventive, even fantastic” pieces, to the later “serious, heavily autobiographical, first-person narratives\"...In France Gide was considered a great stylist in the classical sense, “with his clear, succinct, spare, deliberately, subtly phrased sentences.”\n\nGide's surviving letters run into the thousands. But it is the Journal that Sheridan calls “the pre-eminently Gidean mode of expression.”Information in this paragraph is extracted from André Gide: A Life in the Present by Alan Sheridan, pages 628. \"His first novel emerged from Gide’s own journal, and many of the first-person narratives read more or less like journals. In Les faux-monnayeurs, Edouard's journal provides an alternative voice to the narrator's.” “In 1946, when Pierre Herbert asked Gide which of his books he would choose if only one were to survive,” Gide replied, 'I think it would be my Journal.\"  Beginning at the age of eighteen or nineteen, Gide kept a journal all of his life and when these were first made available to the public, they ran to thirteen hundred pages.Journals: 1889-1913 by André Gide, trans. by Justin O’Brien, p. xii.\n\nStruggle for values\n\n“Each volume that Gide wrote was intended to challenge itself, what had preceded it, and what could conceivably follow it. This characteristic, according to Daniel Moutote in his Cahiers de André Gide essay, is what makes Gide's work ‘essentially modern’: the 'perpetual renewal of the values by which one lives.'\"Quote taken from the article on André Gide in Contemporary Authors Online, 2003. Retrieved with library card October 2014. Gide wrote in his Journal in 1930: “The only drama that really interests me and that I should always be willing to depict anew, is the debate of the individual with whatever keeps him from being authentic, with whatever is opposed to his integrity, to his integration. Most often the obstacle is within him. And all the rest is merely accidental.”Journals: 1889-1913 by André Gide, trans. by Justin O’Brien, p. xvii.\n\nAs a whole, “The works of André Gide reveal his passionate revolt against the restraints and conventions inherited from 19th-century France. He sought to uncover the authentic self beneath its contradictory masks.”Quote taken from the article on André Gide in the Encyclopedia of World Biography, Dec. 12, 1998, Gale Pub. Retrieved with library card October 2014.\n\nSexuality\n\nIn his journal, Gide distinguishes between adult-attracted “sodomites” and boy-loving “pederasts”, categorizing himself as the latter.\n\nIn the company of Oscar Wilde, he had several sexual encounters with young boys abroad. \n\nGide’s novel Corydon, which he considered his most important work, erects a defense of pederasty.\n\nBibliography",

Retrieved with library card October 2014.\n\nBut as Gide’s biographer Alan Sheridan points out, “It is the fiction that lies at the summit of Gide’s work.”Information in this paragraph is extracted from André Gide: A Life in the Present by Alan Sheridan, pp. 629-33. \"Here, as in the oeuvre as a whole, what strikes one first is the variety. Here, too, we see Gide’s curiosity, his youthfulness, at work: a refusal to mine only one seam, to repeat successful formulas...The fiction spans the early years of Symbolism, to the “comic, more inventive, even fantastic” pieces, to the later “serious, heavily autobiographical, first-person narratives\"...In France Gide was considered a great stylist in the classical sense, “with his clear, succinct, spare, deliberately, subtly phrased sentences.”\n\nGide's surviving letters run into the thousands. But it is the Journal that Sheridan calls “the pre-eminently Gidean mode of expression.”Information in this paragraph is extracted from André Gide: A Life in the Present by Alan Sheridan, pages 628. \"His first novel emerged from Gide’s own journal, and many of the first-person narratives read more or less like journals. In Les faux-monnayeurs, Edouard's journal provides an alternative voice to the narrator's.” “In 1946, when Pierre Herbert asked Gide which of his books he would choose if only one were to survive,” Gide replied, 'I think it would be my Journal.\"  Beginning at the age of eighteen or nineteen, Gide kept a journal all of his life and when these were first made available to the public, they ran to thirteen hundred pages.Journals: 1889-1913 by André Gide, trans. by Justin O’Brien, p. xii.\n\nStruggle for values\n\n“Each volume that Gide wrote was intended to challenge itself, what had preceded it, and what could conceivably follow it. This characteristic, according to Daniel Moutote in his Cahiers de André Gide essay, is what makes Gide's work ‘essentially modern’: the 'perpetual renewal of the values by which one lives.'\"Quote taken from the article on André Gide in Contemporary Authors Online, 2003. Retrieved with library card October 2014. Gide wrote in his Journal in 1930: “The only drama that really interests me and that I should always be willing to depict anew, is the debate of the individual with whatever keeps him from being authentic, with whatever is opposed to his integrity, to his integration. Most often the obstacle is within him. And all the rest is merely accidental.”Journals: 1889-1913 by André Gide, trans. by Justin O’Brien, p. xvii.\n\nAs a whole, “The works of André Gide reveal his passionate revolt against the restraints and conventions inherited from 19th-century France. He sought to uncover the authentic self beneath its contradictory masks.”Quote taken from the article on André Gide in the Encyclopedia of World Biography, Dec. 12, 1998, Gale Pub. Retrieved with library card October 2014.\n\nSexuality\n\nIn his journal, Gide distinguishes between adult-attracted “sodomites” and boy-loving “pederasts”, categorizing himself as the latter.\n\nIn the company of Oscar Wilde, he had several sexual encounters with young boys abroad. \n\nGide’s novel Corydon, which he considered his most important work, erects a defense of pederasty.\n\nBibliography.
