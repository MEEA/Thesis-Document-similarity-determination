  "textBody" : "The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is located in west central Africa. Bioko Island lies about 40 km from Cameroon. Annobón Island lies about 595 km southwest of Bioko Island. The larger continental region of Rio Muni lies between Cameroon and Gabon on the mainland; it includes the islands of Corisco, Elobey Grande, Elobey Chico, and adjacent islets.\n\nBioko Island, called Fernando Po until the 1970s, is the largest island in the Gulf of Guinea - 2017 km2. It is shaped like a boot, with two large volcanic formations separated by a valley that bisects the island at its narrowest point. The 195 km coastline is steep and rugged in the south but lower and more accessible in the north, with excellent harbors at Malabo and Luba, and several scenic beaches between those towns.\n\nOn the continent, Rio Muni covers 26003 km2. The coastal plain gives way to a succession of valleys separated by low hills and spurs of the Crystal Mountains. The Rio Benito (Mbini) which divides Rio Muni in half, is unnavigable except for a 20-kilometer stretch at its estuary. Temperatures and humidity in Rio Muni are generally lower than on Bioko Island.\n\nAnnobon Island, named for its discovery on New Year's Day 1472, is a small volcanic island covering 18 km2. The coastline is abrupt except in the north; the principal volcanic cone contains a small lake. Most of the estimated 1,900 inhabitants are fisherman specializing in traditional, smallscale tuna fishing and whaling. The climate is tropical—heavy rainfall, high humidity, and frequent seasonal changes with violent windstorms.\n\nLocation:\nWestern Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Cameroon and Gabon.\n\nBoundaries \n\nEquatorial Guinea's land boundaries total 528 km. It borders Cameroon (183 km) in the north and Gabon (345 km) in the east and south.\n\nMaritime claims:\nterritorial sea:\n12 nmi\n\nexclusive economic zone:\n200 nmi\n\nClimate \n\nThe climate of both the continental region and the islands is typically equatorial, with high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and much cloud cover most of the year. Local variations are due to differences in altitude and proximity to the sea. The wet seasons in the continental region are from February to June and from September to December. Rainfall is higher on the coast than inland. In Bata the rainiest months are September, October, and November, with rainfall averaging more than 94 in a year. At Calatrava, farther south on the coast, it sometimes reaches 180 in. Inland, however, rainfall diminishes; Mikomeseng, for example, receives only about 58 in. The average annual temperature is about 79 F and is fairly constant throughout the year. The temperature maxima are somewhat lower than in Bioko. The relative humidity, however, is higher than in Bioko. Bioko has a rather debilitating climate. The so-called dry season lasts from November to March, and the rest of the year is rainy. The average annual temperature of about 77 F varies little throughout the year. Afternoon temperatures reach the high 80s °F (low 30s °C) and drop to only about 70 F at night. Most of the time the sky is cloudy and overcast. Extreme rainfall occurs in the south, with rain brought by monsoon winds amounting to about 450 in a year around San Antonio de Ureca.\n\nTerrain \n\nCoastal plains rise to interior hills; islands are volcanic.\n\nIrrigated land:\nNA km²\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n26 km3 (2011)\n\nNatural hazards:\nviolent windstorms, flash floods\n\nEnvironment - current issues:\ntap water is not potable; deforestation\n\nEnvironment - international agreements:\nparty to:\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified:\nnone of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note:\ninsular and continental regions rather widely separated\n\nExtreme points \n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Equatorial Guinea, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point - Punta Europa, Bioko Island\n* Easternmost point - the eastern section of the border with Gabon*\n* Southernmost point - A Dyibó, Annobón Island\n* Westernmost point - Punta Dyiscoj, Annobón Island\n* Note: technically Equatorial Guinea does not have an eastern-most point as its eastern border is formed by a straight line between the 11° and 12° of latitude",
