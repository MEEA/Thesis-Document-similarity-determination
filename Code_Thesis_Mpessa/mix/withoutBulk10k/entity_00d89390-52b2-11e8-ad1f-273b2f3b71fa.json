  "textBody" : "Telecommunications in Guinea include radio, television, fixed and mobile radio, and the Internet.\n\nThe people of Guinea are among the poorest in West Africa and this reality is reflected in the development of the country's telecommunications environment. Radio is the most important source of information for the public in Guinea, and the only one to reach the entire country.\n\nThere is a single government-owned radio network, a growing number of private radio stations, and one government TV station. The fixed telephone system is inadequate, with just 18,000 lines to serve the country's 10.5 million inhabitants in 2012. Internet usage is very low, reaching just 1.5% of the population in 2012.\n\nRadio and television\n\nRadio remains the most important source of information for the public, and the only one to reach the entire country.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13442054 \"\"], BBC News, 14 March 2012. Retrieved 4 February 2014. The government licensed the country's first private broadcasters in 2006.\n\n* Radio stations:\n** one state-run radio broadcast station, Radio Television Guineenne (RTG); RTG also operates several stations in rural areas; there are a steadily increasing number of privately owned radio stations, nearly all in the capital, Conakry; and about a dozen community radio stations (2011);[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gv.html \"Communications: Guinea\"], World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 28 January 2014.

For example:\n* On 26 August 2012, the National Communication Council (CNC) suspended private radio station Liberte FM, based in the Forest Region city of N’Zerekore. The closure prevented Liberte FM from covering protests announced by opposition leaders for the following day. The national government allowed Liberty FM to reopen 48 hours later, after the protests concluded.\n* On 1 October 2012, Electricity of Guinea cut service to Espace FM, host of the investigative reporting radio program \"The Big Mouths.\" The utility company claimed that Espace FM and its sister station, Sweet FM, collectively owed nearly 150 million GNF ($21,521) for electricity bills, despite the station’s possession of payment receipts. Both stations were forced to operate on expensive generator power.\n* The government has been accused of penalizing stations and journalists who broadcast items criticizing government officials and their actions. Some journalists accuse government officials of attempting to influence the tone of their reporting with inappropriate pressure and bribes. Some journalists also hire bodyguards, and many practice self-censorship.\n\nTelephones\n\n* Calling code: +224\n* International call prefix: 00[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/sp/T-SP-E.164C-2011-PDF-E.pdf Dialing Procedures (International Prefix, National (Trunk) Prefix and National (Significant) Number) (in Accordance with ITY-T Recommendation E.164 (11/2010))], Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 994-15.XII.2011, International Telecommunication Union (ITU, Geneva), 15 December 2011.
