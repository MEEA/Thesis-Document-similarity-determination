The second edition book is revised and corrected.\n\nGURPS Supers deals with super-powered characters in a modern-day setting, and contains all the necessary rules to create superheroes for the GURPS basic system. The book also contains suggestions for running a superhero campaign, and a detailed background setting with the UN controlling most superheroes.\n\nSetting\n\nThe official \"house setting\" for GURPS Supers is the \"IST World\", described briefly in chapter 7 of GURPS Supers and later appearing in its own full-length supplement, GURPS International Super Teams.\n\nSystem\n\nGURPS Supers is a supplement for the GURPS roleplaying game and uses that basic rule system.

Players can select from a wide variety of powers and their modifications given in GURPS Supers, augmented by those in the GURPS Basic, plus any other GURPS book included by the campaign. The rules book included advice on creating superhero campaigns, and ways for the game master to customize the style of the campaign.\n\nAs part of the GURPS system, GURPS Supers allows the exchange of a player's characters between any of the numerous other genres supported by GURPS.

Many of the superpowers unique to GURPS Supers appear as Advantages and Disadvantages in the GURPS 4e Basic Set.\n\nHistory\n\nGURPS Supers was written by Loyd Blankenship, with a cover by Alan Gutierrez and Charlie Weidman, and was first published by Steve Jackson Games in 1988 as a 112-page book. GURPS Space was one of the broad genre books that followed the publication of the GURPS Basic Set.\n\nThe 2nd edition of GURPS Supers was published in 1990 and featured a cover by John Zeleznik.\n\nEarlier editions and supplements\n\nThe first edition of GURPS Supers was printed in 1989, and the second edition was published in 1990.  The first edition had groupings of character powers that were not used in the second edition. Both were based on the Third Edition of GURPS Basic.\n\nThere were various aids, supplements and ready-made adventures available, including:\n*GURPS Supers Adventures\n*GURPS Supers: Death Wish\n*GURPS Supers: Mixed Doubles\n*GURPS Supers: School of Hard Knocks\n*GURPS Supers: Superscum\n*GURPS Supers: Supertemps\n*Hellboy Sourcebook and Roleplaying Game (based on the Hellboy) series\n*GURPS Wild Cards (based on Wild Cards series) \n*GURPS Wild Cards: Aces Abroad\n\n4th Edition\n\nGURPS Supers for 4e was published in 2007, one of several genre books published by Steve Jackson Games for the new edition.\n\nFor the 4th edition of GURPS, the majority of rules governing the creation of superhero characters are covered in the more generic GURPS Powers.http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/supers/ A PDF release by William H. Stoddard covers the genre specific information in a similar style to GURPS Fantasy and GURPS Space books for the fourth edition of GURPS.http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=SJG37-0302\n\nReception\n\nRick Swan reviewed the second edition of GURPS Supers for Dragon magazine #233 (September 1996). Comparing it to the Champions RPG, Swan comments that \"GURPS Super takes a more realistic route, stressing personality over punch-outs. That's not to say it's stodgy; a typical chapter is titled \"Unnatural Multiple Limbs from Another World.\" The Second Edition streamlines the occasionally awkward mechanics of the First Edition and adds some nifty new powers.\"\n\nSteve Faragher reviewed the second edition of GURPS Supers for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. He calls the background setting \"rather dull\", saying it is \"fine if you want to recreate a Saturday afternoon TV show, but not so great for a more fantastic, underground campaign of the Watchmen variety\". Faragher concludes that \"it's a competent enough set of rules - and one that's well presented - but GURPS Supers is not exactly compulsive playing material\".\n\nReviewed in Games Review v2 #1.",
