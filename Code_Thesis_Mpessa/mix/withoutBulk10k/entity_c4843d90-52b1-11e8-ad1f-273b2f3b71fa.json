  "textBody" : "In abstract algebra, an alternative algebra is an algebra in which multiplication need not be associative, only alternative. That is, one must have\n*x(xy) = (xx)y\n*(yx)x = y(xx)\nfor all x and y in the algebra.\n\nEvery associative algebra is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly non-associative algebras such as the octonions.

The associator is a trilinear map given by\n[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)\nBy definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent toSchafer (1995) p.27\n[x,x,y] = 0\n[y,x,x] = 0.\nBoth of these identities together imply that the associator is totally skew-symmetric.
