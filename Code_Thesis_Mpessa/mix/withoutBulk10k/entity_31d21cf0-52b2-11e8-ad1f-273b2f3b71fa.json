  "textBody" : "Lyon & Healy is an American harp manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois. Their Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility contains a showroom and concert hall. George W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy began the company in 1864 as a sheet music shop. By the end of the 19th century, they manufactured a wide range of musical instruments—including guitars, mandolins, banjos, and various brass and percussion instruments.\n\nLyon & Healy harps are widely played by professional musicians, since they are one of the few makers of harps for orchestral use—which are known as concert harps or pedal harps. Lyon & Healy also makes smaller folk harps or lever harps (based on traditional Irish and Scottish instruments) that use levers to change string pitch instead of pedals. In the 1980s, Lyon & Healy also began to manufacture electroacoustic harps and, later, solid body electric harps.\n\nHistory\n\nGeorge W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy founded the company in 1864, after they moved from Boston to start a sheet music shop for music publisher Oliver Ditson. Determining Lyon & Healy's history is complicated because its building and company records were destroyed in two fires, including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Two smaller fires did little damage to the firm and did not result in data loss.\n\nCompany letters and trade catalogs don't provide exact dates that would reveal when Lyon & Healy began manufacturing instruments. An article in the Musical Courier states that Lyon & Healy began manufacturing instruments in 1885. Clearly, Lyon & Healy was making fretted string instruments in the 1880s, with Washburn (guitars, mandolins, banjos, and zithers) as their premier line. By the 1900s, if not earlier, Lyon & Healy might well have been manufacturing bowed string instruments.\n\nLyon & Healy also made various percussion instruments. Later, Lyon & Healy began manufacturing brass instruments, possibly as early as the 1890s. Lyon & Healy also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services. Complicating matters still further, Lyon & Healy engraved instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. In its 1892 catalog, it claimed that it manufactured 100,000 instruments annually.\n\nFile:SweetByAndBy1868.png|\t\t\t\t\t\"The Sweet By and By\"  sheet music (1868)\nFile:NorthernSeymourBlairSong.png|\t\t\t\tCover of Northern (Chicago) campaign song book  (1868)\nFile:Washburn Parlor Guitar (1894) and \"New Model\" (1896), Museum of Making Music.jpg|\tWashburn parlor guitars (1894/96)\nFile:Lyon & Healy Lakeside (late 1900s) brighten.jpg|\t\tLakeside guitar (1900s)\nFile:Lyon&HealeyTenorGuitarReplica.jpg|\t\t\t\tLyon & Healey tenor guitar (replica)\nFile:Piccolomando.jpg|\t\t\t\t\t\tLeland piccolo mandolin (1911)\n\nThe company is known to have made other instruments, including reed organs and pianos.

In 1894 Robert J. Bennett came to Lyon & Healy from the Hutchens company of Boston to head their organ department.

In the 1970s, the firm concentrated solely upon making and selling harps.\n\nIn 1928, Lyon & Healy introduced one of the most unusual harps ever mass-produced, the Salzedo Model. The company designed it in collaboration with the harpist Carlos Salzedo. It an Art Deco style instrument that incorporates bold red and white lines on the soundboard to create a stylized and distinct appearance.\n\nIn the 1960s, Lyon & Healy introduced a smaller lever harp, the Troubadour, a 36-string harp for young beginners with smaller hands, and for casual players.

The \"Shamrock model folk harp\" has 34 strings.  It stands 55 in tall with its legs. The legs can be removed so the player can hold the instrument lap—style on the knees. It weighs about 10 kg.
