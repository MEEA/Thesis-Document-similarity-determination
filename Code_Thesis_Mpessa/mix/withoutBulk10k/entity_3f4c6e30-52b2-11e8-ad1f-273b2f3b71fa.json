  "textBody" : "A musical saw, also called a singing saw, is a hand saw used as a musical instrument. Capable of continuous glissando (portamento), the sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the theremin. The musical saw is classified as a plaque friction idiophone with direct friction (132.22) under the Hornbostel-Sachs system of musical instrument classification.\n\nPlaying\n\nThe saw is generally played seated with the handle squeezed between the legs, and the far end held with one hand. Some sawists play standing, either with the handle between the knees and the blade sticking out in front of them. The saw is usually played with the serrated edge, or \"teeth\", facing the body, though some players face them away. Some saw players file down the teeth which makes no discernable difference to the sound. Many—especially professional—saw players use a handle, called a Cheat, at the tip of the saw for easier bending and higher virtuosity.\n\nTo sound a note, a sawist first bends the blade into an S-curve. The parts of the blade that are curved are damped from vibration, and do not sound. At the center of the S-curve a section of the blade remains relatively flat. This section, the \"sweet spot\", can vibrate across the width of the blade, producing a distinct pitch: the wider the section of blade, the lower the sound. Sound is usually created by drawing a bow across the back edge of the saw at the sweet spot, or sometimes by striking the sweet spot with a mallet. The sawist controls the pitch by adjusting the S-curve, making the sweet spot travel up the blade (toward a thinner width) for a higher pitch, or toward the handle for a lower pitch. Harmonics can be created by playing at varying distances on either side of the sweet spot. Sawists can add vibrato by shaking one of their legs or by wobbling the hand that holds the tip of the blade. Once a sound is produced, it will sustain for quite a while, and can be carried through several notes of a phrase.\n\nOn occasion the musical saw is called for in orchestral music, but orchestral percussionists are seldom also sawists.  If a note outside of the saw's range is called for, an electric guitar with a slide can be substituted.Karl Peinkofer and Fritz Tannigel, Handbook of Percussion Instruments, (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), 75.\n\nTypes\n\nSawists often use standard wood-cutting saws, although special musical saws are also made. As compared with wood-cutting saws, the blades of musical saws are generally wider, for range, and longer, for finer control. They do not have set or sharpened teeth, and may have grain running parallel to the back edge of the saw, rather than parallel to the teeth. Some musical saws are made with thinner metal, to increase flexibility, while others are made thicker, for a richer tone, longer sustain, and stronger harmonics. A typical musical saw is  wide at the handle end and  wide at the tip. Such a saw will generally produce about two octaves, regardless of length. A bass saw may be  at the handle and produce about two-and-a-half octaves. There are also musical saws with 3-4 octaves range. Two-person saws, also called \"misery whips\", can also be played, though with less virtuosity, and they produce an octave or less of range.\n\nMost sawists use cello or violin bows, using violin rosin, but some may use improvised home-made bows, such as a wooden dowel.\n\nProducers\n\nMusical saws have been produced for over a century, primarily in the United States, but also in Scandinavia, Germany, France (Lame sonore) and Asia.\n\nUnited States \n\nIn the early 1900s, there were at least ten companies in the United States manufacturing musical saws.\"[http://www.sawlady.com/DifferentSaws.htm]\", SawLady—Musical Saw manufacturers.

In the shooting breaks and at weekends both performed romantic duets, he at the piano and she at the musical saw.Daniel Spoto: Marlene Dietrich. Heyne Verlag, München 1992, p.61 Sym gave his saw to her as a farewell gift.

Some of these shows were broadcast on radio, so there exist two rare recordings of her saw playing, embedded in entertaining interviews. 1.

He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for The New Babylon (1929), in The Nose (1928), and in Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1934).\nShostakovich and other composers of his time used the term \"Flexaton\" to mark the musical saw. \"Flexaton\" just means \"to flex a tone\"—the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called Flexatone, so there has been confusion for a long time.\"[http://www.singende-saege.com/shostakovich-the-nose.html article about the Flexaton and Shostakovich]\" Aram Khachaturian, who knew Shostakovich's music included the musical saw in his Piano Concerto (Khachaturian) (1936) in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss Arthur Honegger, who included the saw in his opera Antigone (Honegger) in 1924 . \nThe Romanian composer George Enescu used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera  Œdipe (1931) to show in an extensive glissando—which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw—the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus.\nThe Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece Quattro pezzi per orchestra (1959). German composer Hans Werner Henze took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera Elegy for young lovers (1961).\nOther composers were Krysztof Penderecki with Fluorescences (1961), De natura sonoris Nr. 2 (1971) and the opera Ubu Rex (1990), Bernd Alois Zimmermann with Stille und Umkehr (1970), George Crumb with Ancient voices of children (1970), John Corigliano with The Mannheim Rocket (2001).\nChaya Czernowin used the saw in her opera \"PNIMA...Ins Innere\" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust. \nThere are Further Leif Segerstam, Hans Zender (orchestration of \"5 préludes\" by Claude Debussy), Franz Schreker (opera Christophorus) and Oscar Strasnoy (opera Le bal).\nRussian composer Lera Auerbach wrote for the saw in her ballet The Little Mermaid (2005), in her symphonic poem Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon (2005), in her oratorio \"Requiem Dresden – Ode to Peace\" (2012), in her Piano Concerto No.1 (2015) and in her comic oratorio The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie (2016).\"[http://www.sikorski.de/10619/en/new_work_the_infant_minstrel_and_his_peculiar_menagerie_by_lera_auerbach_in_bergen.html About \"The infant minstrel...\" by Lera Auerbach]\"\n\nCanadian composer Robert Minden has written extensively for the musical saw.see for example: \"Serenade\" from The Boy Who Wanted To Talk To Whales, \"Epilogue\" from Long Journey Home: \"[http://www.lostsound.com/recordings/default.html Catalogue: Otter Bay Productions]\", LostSound.com.

In the shooting breaks and at weekends both performed romantic duets, he at the piano and she at the musical saw.Daniel Spoto: Marlene Dietrich. Heyne Verlag, München 1992, p.61 Sym gave his saw to her as a farewell gift.

He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for The New Babylon (1929), in The Nose (1928), and in Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1934).\nShostakovich and other composers of his time used the term \"Flexaton\" to mark the musical saw. \"Flexaton\" just means \"to flex a tone\"—the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called Flexatone, so there has been confusion for a long time.\"[http://www.singende-saege.com/shostakovich-the-nose.html article about the Flexaton and Shostakovich]\" Aram Khachaturian, who knew Shostakovich's music included the musical saw in his Piano Concerto (Khachaturian) (1936) in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss Arthur Honegger, who included the saw in his opera Antigone (Honegger) in 1924 . \nThe Romanian composer George Enescu used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera  Œdipe (1931) to show in an extensive glissando—which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw—the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus.\nThe Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece Quattro pezzi per orchestra (1959). German composer Hans Werner Henze took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera Elegy for young lovers (1961).\nOther composers were Krysztof Penderecki with Fluorescences (1961), De natura sonoris Nr. 2 (1971) and the opera Ubu Rex (1990), Bernd Alois Zimmermann with Stille und Umkehr (1970), George Crumb with Ancient voices of children (1970), John Corigliano with The Mannheim Rocket (2001).\nChaya Czernowin used the saw in her opera \"PNIMA...Ins Innere\" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust. \nThere are Further Leif Segerstam, Hans Zender (orchestration of \"5 préludes\" by Claude Debussy), Franz Schreker (opera Christophorus) and Oscar Strasnoy (opera Le bal).\nRussian composer Lera Auerbach wrote for the saw in her ballet The Little Mermaid (2005), in her symphonic poem Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon (2005), in her oratorio \"Requiem Dresden – Ode to Peace\" (2012), in her Piano Concerto No.1 (2015) and in her comic oratorio The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie (2016).\"[http://www.sikorski.de/10619/en/new_work_the_infant_minstrel_and_his_peculiar_menagerie_by_lera_auerbach_in_bergen.html About \"The infant minstrel...\" by Lera Auerbach]\"\n\nCanadian composer Robert Minden has written extensively for the musical saw.see for example: \"Serenade\" from The Boy Who Wanted To Talk To Whales, \"Epilogue\" from Long Journey Home: \"[http://www.lostsound.com/recordings/default.html Catalogue: Otter Bay Productions]\", LostSound.com.

Also in his musical The Black Rider there is a part for musical saw.\nPerhaps the most prolific composer for the musical saw is Scott Munson, who wrote many contemporary pieces for musical saw, as well as music for theater plays, film, and television using the instrument.\n\nSample.
