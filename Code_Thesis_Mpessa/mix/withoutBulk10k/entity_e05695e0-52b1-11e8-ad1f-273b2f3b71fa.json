The subgroup of G generated by all commutators is called the derived group or the commutator subgroup of G. Note that one must consider the subgroup generated by the set of commutators because in general the set of commutators is not closed under the group operation. Commutators are used to define nilpotent and solvable groups.\n\nThe above definition of the commutator is used by some group theorists, as well as throughout this article.

Many other group theorists define the conjugate of  by  as .  This is often written {}^x a.  Similar identities hold for these conventions.\n\nA wide range of identities are used that are true modulo certain subgroups.  These can be particularly useful in the study of solvable groups and nilpotent groups.

The anticommutator is used less often than the commutator, but can be used for example to define Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras and is utilised to derive the Dirac equation in particle physics.\n\nThe commutator of two operators acting on a Hilbert space is a central concept in quantum mechanics, since it quantifies how well the two observables described by these operators can be measured simultaneously.
