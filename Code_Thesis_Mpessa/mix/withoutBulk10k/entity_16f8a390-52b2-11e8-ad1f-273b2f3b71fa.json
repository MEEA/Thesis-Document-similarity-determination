  "textBody" : "Telecommunications in Ireland operate in a regulated competitive market that provides customers with a wide array of advanced digital services. This article explores Ireland's telecommunications infrastructure including: fixed and mobile networks, voice, data and Internet services, cable television, developments in next generation networks and broadcast networks for radio and television.\n\nRegulation\n\nTelecommunications, including radio frequency spectrum licensing and the postal sector, are regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). ComReg was established on 1 December 2002. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) () is the regulator of both public and commercial broadcasting sector in Ireland. It was established on 1 October 2009, replacing the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) ().\n\nThe Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall responsibility for national policy and regulation of both telecommunications and broadcasting.\n\nThe telecommunications market in Ireland was opened to competition in 1998.[http://articles.cnn.com/1998-12-07/tech/9812_07_irish.idg_1_esat-clear-licenses-valueadded-services?_sPM:TECH \"Irish telecom market opens to competition\"], CNN, 7 December 1998 In 2007 licensed operators other than Eir, the former state-owned monopoly, accounted for 32% of the market.[http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/ComReg0767.pdf Quarterly Key Data Report for September 2007], Commission for Communications Regulation (Comreg), 7 September 2007, page 11, Fig 2.1.3 By June 2011 this figure had risen to 41% of fixed line revenue.[http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/COMREGAR10-11.pdf \"Annual Report 2010 / 2011\"], Commission for Communications Regulation, 20 April 2012 Eir remains the largest telecommunications company in Ireland, offering fixed, mobile, and broadband services. As Bord Telecom Éireann, the company was state owned until 1999, when it was floated on the Irish and New York Stock Exchanges.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nIreland's telecommunications network is a modern digital system connected by an extensive national fibre optic network with multiple high capacity fibre optic links to the UK, Continental Europe, North America and with dedicated capacity on routes to Asia and other parts of the globe.\nThere is an open and competitive telecommunications market regulated by ComReg. However, the fixed-line market is still dominated by the incumbent operator Eir.\n\nSeveral companies operate national fibre optic networks including Eir, BT Ireland, ESB Group and Virgin Media Ireland. Eir's fibre network is the most extensive covering most parts of the country with 12,000 km of fibre routes (>40,000 km of fibres)[http://www.nextgenerationnetwork.ie/eircom-fibre-network Eircom].\nEir's Next Generation Network upgrade rolled out Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) which is capable of delivering up to 320 Gbit/s along a single fibre route.\nThis upgrade also sees Eir's core infrastructure moving to an all-IP network. It has major aggregation nodes at 140 locations around Ireland and onward fibre connections to another 470 central office sites.\n\nIreland also has major connections to multiple international fibre optic networks, an example of which is GTT Communications.\n\n94 Irish towns and cities also have access to publicly owned, carrier-neutral metropolitan fibre networks managed by e|net.[http://www.e-net.ie enet]\nThese networks can be used by any licensed Irish telecommunications operator to provide commercial or residential end users with products.\n\nFor residential and small business providers, most major urban areas have access to Virgin Media Ireland's HFC network which provides speeds of up to 360Mbit/s using EuroDOCSIS 3.0 cable modem technology.\n\nEir is also in the process of rolling out FTTC which provides speeds of up to 100Mbit/s down and 20Mbit/s up. The system uses VDSL2 and vectoring between the FTTC cabinet and the end user. Retail services using this next generation access infrastructure are provided by approximately 15 operators.\n\nIreland has three mobile networks that own and operate their own network infrastructure and a number of MVNO operators that operate mobile phone services using one of these infrastructure providers' radio networks. The three infrastructure owning networks are:\n* Networks providing 2G GSM and 3G UMTS: Vodafone Ireland\n* Network providing 3G UMTS only: Three Ireland\n\nMeteor and Eir Mobile were the first to launch 4G LTE services in Ireland on 26 September 2013, followed by Vodafone on 14 October 2013, and Three on 27 January 2014. O2 was due to launch its 4G services later in 2014, but plans were put on hold when its acquisition by Three was approved in May, and from the time of the merger in 2015, previous O2 customers gained 4G coverage through Three's network, albeit with initial service problems.\n\nIn 2016, 41.9% of Ireland's mobile subscriptions were using 4G technology. 3G remained the dominant technology with 44.6% share, however, it is likely to be overtaken by 4G in 2017.\n\nTelephone system\n\n* Fixed telephone lines in use 1,168,591 (Q4 2012, ComStat)\n* Mobile cellular telephones: 5,460,507 (Q4 2012, ComStat)\n* Country code: 353\n\nAs mobile phone services become more price competitive, more Irish customers are opting to drop landline services. This is reflected by a sharp fall in the number of fixed line channels in use and an equivalent increase in mobile subscriptions. Details are tracked on ComReg's ComStat websitehttp://www.comstat.ie\n\nThere are three mobile telecommunications providers: Three Ireland, eirMobile and Vodafone Ireland.\n\nThere are also six MNVOs (Mobile Network Virtual Operator): [http://www.48months.ie 48] (runs off the Three network), [https://www.virginmedia.ie/mobile/ Virgin Mobile] (runs off the Three network), [http://www.tescomobile.ie Tesco Mobile] (runs off the Three network), [http://www.lycamobile.ie Lycamobile] (runs off the Three network), [http://www.blueface.ie Blueface] (runs off the Three network) and [http://www.postfone.ie Postfone] (runs off the Vodafone network). \n\nHistory\n\nThe original network was taken over by the Irish Department of Posts and Telegraphs (P&T) from the British Post Office in 1921 and used a mixture of manual and step-by-step automatic exchanges. Development of the network was relatively stagnant with slow rollout of automatic switching using step-by-step exchanges until after WWII.\nFrom 1957 onwards, P&T began to rollout more modern crossbar switches using equipment supplied by Ericsson built at their Athlone facility. This saw significant improvements to many services, but the network was still quite underdeveloped in rural areas.\nDigital switching was introduced in 1980 using Ericsson AXE and Alcatel E10 switches both of which were manufactured at facilities in Ireland. This saw a total transformation of the telephone network with modern automatic and digital services reaching even the most rural parts of Ireland by the mid 1980s.\nThe fixed line network is now made up of multiple operators using a diverse range of digital technologies including VoIP.\n\nIreland's first mobile telephone network, Eircell went live in 1986 using the analogue TACS system.\n2G GSM services from Eircell launched on 1 July 1993. Digifone followed in 1997, then Meteor in 2001 (having been licensed in 1998) and 3 Ireland launched its UMTS 3G-only service in 2005.\n\n3G services launched in 2004 (Vodafone Ireland) and other networks quickly followed suit, and 4G launched in 2013 (Meteor) and is now available on most networks.\n\nInternet\n\n* Internet users: 3.6 million, 77% of the population, 70th in the world (2011);[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/material/excel/Individuals%20using%20the%20Internet2000-2011.xls Percentage of Individuals using the Internet 2000–2011], International Telecommunication Union, accessed on 19 August 2012. 3.0 million, 67th in the world (2009)[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ei.html \"Communications :: Ireland\"], World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, retrieved 28 February 2013\n* Dial-up subscriptions: 11 437 (Q4 2012 ComStat)\n* Fixed broadband subscriptions: 1,666,645 (Q4 2012 ComStat)\n* Mobile broadband subscriptions: 554,563 Q4 2012 ComStat)\n* Internet hosts: 1.4 million, 40th in the world (2012)\n* Internet censorship: None (2011)[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid=186364 \"Ireland: Freedom of Speech and Press and Internet Freedom\"], Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State\n* Top-level domain name: .ie\n\nBroadband Internet access is available in Ireland via DSL, cable, wireless, and satellite.

The first commercial radio stations began broadcasting in 1989. Prior to 1989 hundreds of pirate radio stations were a mainstay of radio listener-ship, particularly in Dublin, and a handful of pirate stations continue to operate illegally today. In 1998 TV3 became the first privately owned commercial TV station and it remains the main free-to-air service after RTÉ. Competition also comes from British public and private terrestrial TV. Satellite and cable TV are widely available. There are also non-commercial community and special interest radio stations.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17478649 \"Ireland profile: Media\"], BBC News, 26 March 2012\n\nRTÉ both produces programmes and broadcasts them on television, radio and the Internet in English and Irish. The radio service began on 1 January 1926, while regular television broadcasts began on 31 December 1961, making RTÉ one of the oldest continuously operating public service broadcasters in the world. Some RTÉ services are only funded by advertising, while other RTÉ services are only funded by the television licence fee.\n\nSaorview ( ) is Ireland's national free-to-air digital terrestrial television (DTT) service operated by 2RN.
