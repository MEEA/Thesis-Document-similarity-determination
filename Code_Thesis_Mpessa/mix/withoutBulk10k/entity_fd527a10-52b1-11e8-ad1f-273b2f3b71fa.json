  "textBody" : "The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) to gain and maintain air supremacy in aerial combat.   Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.Spick 2000, p. 127.\n\nThe Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft. Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability[https://www.scribd.com/doc/94122923/PS-940-F-15-Armament-Handbook-Oct-1979 \"PS 940 F-15 Armament Handbook, Oct-1979.\"] scribd.com. Retrieved: 29 November 2012. that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, an improved and enhanced version which was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations. As of 2017, the aircraft is being produced in different variants with production set to end in 2022.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nThe F-15 can trace its origins to the Vietnam War, when the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy fought over tactical aircraft being used in the war. At the time, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, even if there were performance sacrifices involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy were involved in the TFX (F-111) program, aiming to deliver a medium-range interdiction aircraft in Air Force use that would also serve as a long-range interceptor aircraft for the Navy.\n\nIn January 1965, Secretary McNamara asked the Air Force to consider a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and close air support to replace several types like the F-100 Super Sabre and various light bombers then in service. Two basic designs could fill this role; the Navy favored designs like the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II, pure attack aircraft, while the Air Force was more interested in fighters like the Northrop F-5, with a secondary attack capability. The former were more capable in the attack role, while the latter might be less so but could defend themselves. If the Air Force did choose an attack design, maintaining air superiority would be the priority. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to obsolete MiG-15s or MiG-17s on 4 April 1965.\n\nIn April 1965, Harold Brown, at that time director of the DDR&E, stated the favored position was to consider the F-5 and begin studies of the \"F-X\".\"F-X\" should be read as \"Fighter, Unknown designation number\", but is often translated as \"Fighter-Experimental\". These early studies envisioned a production run of 800 to 1,000 aircraft and stressed maneuvrability over speed; it also stated that the aircraft would not be considered without some level of ground attack capability. On 1 August, Gabriel Disosway took command of Tactical Air Command (TAC) and reiterated calls for the F-X, but lowered the required performance from Mach 3 to 2.5 to lower costs. Ultimately, the Air Force chose the A-7 over the F-5 for the support role on 5 November 1965,Munzenmaier, Walter. \"'LTV A-7D/K Corsair II: The 'SLUF' in USAF and USANG Service 1968–1993,\" Famous Aircraft of the USAF and USAG, Volume 1. giving further impetus for an air superiority design as the A-7 lacked any credible air-to-air capability.\n\nAn official requirements document was finalized in October, and sent out as a request for proposals (RFP) to 13 companies on 8 December 1965. Eight companies responded with proposals. Following a downselect, four companies were asked to provide further developments. In total, they developed some 500 design concepts. Typical designs featured variable-sweep wings, weighed over 60000 lb, included a top speed of Mach 2.7 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.75.Jenkins 1998, pp. 5–7. When the proposals were studied in July 1966, the aircraft were roughly the size and weight of the TFX, and like that aircraft, a design that could not be considered an air superiority fighter.\n\nSmaller, lighter\n\nThrough this period, studies of combat over Vietnam were producing worrying results. Theory had stressed long-range combat using missiles and optimized aircraft for this role. The result was highly loaded aircraft with large radar and excellent speed but limited maneuverability and often lacking a gun. The canonical example was the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, used by the USAF, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps to provide air superiority over Vietnam, the only fighter with enough power, range and maneuverability to be given the primary task of dealing with the threat of Soviet fighters while flying with visual engagement rules.\n\nIn practice, due to policy and practical reasons, aircraft were closing to visual range and maneuvering, placing the larger US aircraft at a disadvantage to the much less expensive day fighters like the MiG-21. Missiles proved to be much less reliable than predicted, especially at close range. Although improved training and the introduction of the M61 Vulcan cannon did much to address the disparity, these early outcomes led to considerable re-evaluation of the 1963 Project Forecast doctrine.Michael Gorn, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nl-cjq0nIJEsC&pg=PA45 \"Technology and the Air Force: A Retrospective Assessment\"], pp. 44–47. See also \"Harnessing the genie: science and technology forecasting for the Air Force\". This led to John Boyd's Energy–Maneuverability (E-M) theory, which stressed that extra power and maneuverability were key aspects of a successful fighter design and these were more important than outright speed. Through tireless championing of the concepts and good timing with the \"failure\" of the initial F-X project, the \"fighter mafia\" pressed for a lightweight day fighter that could be built and operated in large numbers in order to ensure air superiority. In early 1967, they proposed that the ideal design had a thrust-to-weight ratio of near 1:1, a maximum speed further reduced to Mach 2.3, a weight of 40000 lb and a wing loading of 80 lb/ft².\n\nBy this time, the Navy had decided the F-111 would not meet their requirements and began the development of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and see whether the VFAX would meet the Air Force's F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was now looking primarily for maneuverability.\n\nFocus on air superiority\n\nIn 1967 the Soviet Union revealed the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 at the Domodedovo airfield near Moscow.Davies 2002, pp. 9–11.\"In July 1967 at Domodedovo airfield near Moscow, the Soviet Union unveiled a new generation of combat aircraft… [codenamed] Foxbat by NATO\": \"Development\" in Modern Fighting Aircraft, 1983. The MiG-25 was designed as a high-speed, high-altitude interceptor aircraft and made many performance tradeoffs to excel in this role.Bowman 1980, p. 193. Among these was the requirement for very high speed, over Mach 2.8, which demanded the use of stainless steel instead of aluminum for many parts of the aircraft. The added weight demanded a much larger wing to allow the aircraft to operate at the required high altitudes. However, to observers, it appeared outwardly similar to the very large F-X studies: an aircraft with high speed and a large wing offering high maneuverability, leading to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense and the various arms that the US was being outclassed. The MiG-23 was likewise a subject of concern, and it was generally believed to be a better aircraft than the F-4. The F-X would outclass the MiG-23, but now it appeared that that MiG-25 would be superior in speed, ceiling and endurance to all existing US fighters, even the F-X. Thus, an effort to improve the F-X followed.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 12.\n\nBoth Headquarters USAF and the TAC continued to call for a multipurpose aircraft, while both Disosway and Air Chief of Staff Bruce K. Holloway pressed for a pure air-superiority design that would be able to meet the expected performance of the MiG-25. During the same period, the Navy had ended its VFAX program and instead accepted a proposal from Grumman Aircraft for a smaller and more maneuverable design known as VFX, later becoming the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. VFX was considerably closer to the evolving F-X requirements. The Air Force in-fighting was eventually ended by the worry that the Navy's VFAX would be forced on them; in May 1968 it was stated that \"We finally decided – and I hope there is no one who still disagrees – that this aircraft is going to be an air superiority fighter\".\n\nIn September 1968, a request for proposals (RFP) was released to major aerospace companies. These requirements called for single-seat fighter having a maximum take-off weight of 40000 lb for the air-to-air role with a maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of nearly 1:1 at mission weight.Jenkins 1998, pp. 8–10. It also called for a twin-engine arrangement, as it was believed that this would respond to throttle changes more rapidly and might offer commonality with the Navy's VFX program. However, details of the avionics were left largely undefined, as it was not clear whether to build a larger aircraft with a powerful radar that could detect the enemy at longer ranges, or alternatively a smaller aircraft that would make it more difficult for the enemy to detect it.\n\nFour companies submitted proposals, with the Air Force eliminating General Dynamics and awarding contracts to Fairchild Republic, North American Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas for the definition phase in December 1968. The companies submitted technical proposals by June 1969. The Air Force announced the selection of McDonnell Douglas on 23 December 1969.Jenkins 1998, pp. 9–11. The winning design resembled the twin-tailed F-14, but with fixed wings; both designs were based on configurations studied in wind-tunnel testing by NASA.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 14.\n\nThe Eagle's initial versions were the F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to \"F-15A\" and \"F-15B\"). These versions would be powered by new Pratt & Whitney F100 engines to achieve a combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25 mm Ford-Philco GAU-7 cannon with caseless ammunition suffered development problems. It was dropped in favor of the standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting surface. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.Spick 2000, pp. 130–131.\n\nThe F-15 has a \"look-down/shoot-down\" radar that can distinguish low-flying moving targets from ground clutter. The F-15 would use computer technology with new controls and displays to lower pilot workload and require only one pilot to save weight. Unlike the F-14 or F-4, the F-15 has only a single canopy frame with clear vision forward. The USAF introduced the F-15 as \"the first dedicated USAF air superiority fighter since the North American F-86 Sabre\".[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR939/MR939.ch5.pdf \"Chapter 5: Return of the Air Superiority Fighter\"]. A Half Century of U.S. Fighter Aircraft R&D. Santa Monica, California: RAND, 1998. .\n\nThe F-15 was favored by customers such as the Israel and Japan air arms. Criticism from the fighter mafia that the F-15 was too large to be a dedicated dogfighter and too expensive to procure in large numbers, led to the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, which led to the USAF General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the middle-weight Navy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.Jenkins 2000, pp. 1–8.\n\nFurther development\n\nThe single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered production in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year.Jenkins 1998, pp. 33–34. These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000), which included 2,000 lb (900 kg) of additional internal fuel, provisions for exterior conformal fuel tanks, and an increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 68,000 lb (30,700 kg). The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel, a full weapons load, conformal fuel tanks, and three external fuel tanks to be carried. The APG-63 radar uses a programmable signal processor (PSP), enabling the radar to be reprogrammable for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment. The PSP was the first of its kind in the world, and the upgraded APG-63 radar was the first radar to use it. Other improvements included strengthened landing gear, a new digital central computer,Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 115. and an overload warning system, which allows the pilot to fly up to 9 g at all weights.\n\nThe F-15 Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) was initiated in February 1983 with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set, allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120A missiles; and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 F-15Cs included the Hughes APG-70 radar developed for the F-15E; these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles. Earlier MSIP F-15Cs with the APG-63 were upgraded to the APG-63(V)1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG-70. Existing F-15s were retrofitted with these improvements.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 161–65.\n\nIn 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, Hughes, teamed to privately develop a strike fighter version of the F-15. This version competed in the Air Force's Dual-Role Fighter competition starting in 1982. The Boeing F-15E strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics' competing F-16XL in 1984.Davies 2003, pp. 15–16, 25, 31–32. Beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P&W F100-PW-220 engine and digital engine controls, providing quicker throttle response, reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption. Starting in 1997, original F100-PW-100 engines were upgraded to a similar configuration with the designation F100-PW-220E starting.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 168–69.\n\nBeginning in 2007, 178 USAF F-15Cs were retrofitted with the AN/APG-63(V)3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar.[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071009c_nr.html \"Boeing Awarded $70 Million Contract for Enhanced F-15C Radar.\"] Boeing, 9 October 2007.

Seen as a necessity because of the low numbers of F-22s procured, the upgrade builds upon the company's F-15SE Silent Eagle concept with low-observable features.  Most improvements focus on lethality including quad-pack munitions racks to double its missile load to 16, conformal fuel tanks for extended range, \"Talon HATE\" communications pod to communicate with 5th generation fighters, the APG-63(v)3 AESA radar, a long-range infrared search and track (IRST) sensor, and BAE Systems' Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) systems.[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-doubles-f-15c-missile-load-in-2040c-eagle-u-416766/ Boeing doubles F-15C missile load in '2040C' Eagle upgrade] – Flightglobal.com, 15 September 2015\n\nAs of 2017, production is set to end in 2022, 50 years after the type's first flight.\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe F-15 has an all-metal semi-monocoque fuselage with a large cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 suggests a modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.\n\nThe empennage is metal and composite construction, with twin aluminium/composite material honeycomb structure vertical stabilizers with boron-composite skin, resulting in an exceptionally thin tailplane and rudders.  Composite horizontal all-moving tails outboard of the vertical stabilizers move independently to provide roll control in some flight regimes.  The F-15 has a spine-mounted air brake and retractable tricycle landing gear. It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney F100 axial compressor turbofan engines with afterburners, mounted side-by-side in the fuselage and fed by intake ramps. The cockpit is mounted high in the forward fuselage with a one-piece windscreen and large canopy for increased visibility and a 360° field of view for the pilot.  The airframe began to incorporate advanced superplastically formed titanium components in the 1980s.\n\nThe F-15's maneuverability is derived from low wing loading (weight to wing area ratio) with a high thrust-to-weight ratio enabling the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed. The F-15 can climb to 30000 ft in around 60 seconds. The thrust output of the dual engines is greater than the aircraft's combat weight, so it has the ability to accelerate vertically. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so that one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat.Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 944. The A and C models are single-seat variants; these were the main air-superiority versions produced. B and D models add a second seat behind the pilot for training. E models use the second seat for a weapon systems officer. Visibly, the F-15 has a unique feature vis-à-vis other modern fighter aircraft: it does not have the distinctive turkey feather aerodynamic exhaust petals covering its engine nozzles.  This is because the petal design on the F-15 was problematic and could fall off in flight; therefore they were removed, resulting in a 3% aerodynamic drag increase.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 46–47.\n\nAvionics\n\nA multi-mission avionics system includes a heads-up display (HUD), advanced radar, AN/ASN-109 inertial guidance system (INS), flight instruments, ultra high frequency (UHF) communications, and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) and instrument landing system (ILS) receivers. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic warfare system, Identification friend or foe (IFF) system, electronic countermeasures suite and a central digital computer.Gunston 1986, p. 194.\n\nThe head-up display projects, through a combiner, all essential flight information gathered by the integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit instruments.Huenecke 1987, pp. 227–30.\n\nThe F-15's versatile APG-63 and 70 pulse-Doppler radar systems can look up at high-flying targets and look-down/shoot-down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. These radars can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The APG-63 has a basic range of 100 mi.  The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15's electronic warfare system provides both threat warning (radar warning receiver) and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.Jenkins 1998, pp. 97–104.\n\nWeaponry and external stores\n\nA variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to release weapons effectively and safely, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.Huenecke 1987, pp. 232–236.\n\nThe Eagle can be armed with combinations of four different air-to-air weapons: AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles or AIM-120 AMRAAM advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder or AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun in the right wing root.Lambert 1993, p. 521.\n\nLow-drag conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) were developed for the F-15C and D models. They can be attached to the sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. These conformal tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel.Jenkins 1998, p. 111. These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks.Green and Swanborough 1998, p. 371. The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nUpgrades\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and deep interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded to include four multi-purpose cathode ray tube displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler aircraft flight control system permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system.Lambert 1993, p. 523. For low-altitude, high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution APG-70 radar and LANTIRN pods to provide thermography.\n\nThe APG-63(V)2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar has been retrofitted to 18 U.S. Air Force F-15C aircraft.[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/n19991208_992202.htm \"18 APG-63(V)2.\"] Fas.org, 8 December 1999. Retrieved: 30 December 2010. This upgrade includes most of the new hardware from the APG-63(V)1, but adds an AESA to provide increased pilot situation awareness. The AESA radar has an exceptionally agile beam, providing nearly instantaneous track updates and enhanced multi-target tracking capability. The APG-63(V)2 is compatible with current F-15C weapon loads and enables pilots to take full advantage of AIM-120 AMRAAM capabilities, simultaneously guiding multiple missiles to several targets widely spaced in azimuth, elevation, or range.\n\nThe most modern version is the F-15 Advanced, which features fly-by-wire controls.\n\nOperational history\n\nIntroduction and early service\n\nThe largest operator of the F-15 is the United States Air Force. The first Eagle, an F-15B, was delivered on 13 November 1974.Scutts 1989, p. 47. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron, the 555th TFS, was delivered. These initial aircraft carried the Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) APG-63 radar.\n\nThe first kill by an F-15 was scored by Israeli Air Force (IAF) ace Moshe Melnik in 1979. During Israeli raids against Palestinian factions in Lebanon in 1979–1981, F-15As reportedly downed 13 Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s and two Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25s. Israeli F-15As and Bs participated as escorts in Operation Opera, an air strike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor. In the 1982 Lebanon War, Israeli F-15s were credited with 41 Syrian aircraft destroyed (23 MiG-21s and 17 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, and one Aérospatiale SA.342L Gazelle helicopter).\n\nIsrael was the only operator to use and develop the air-to-ground abilities of the air-superiority F-15 variants, doing so because the fighter's range was well beyond other combat aircraft in the Israeli inventory in the 1980s. The first known use of F-15s for a strike mission was during Operation Wooden Leg on 1 October 1985, with six F-15Ds attacking PLO Headquarters in Tunis with two GBU-15 guided bombs per aircraft and two F-15Cs re-striking the ruins with six Mk-82 unguided bombs each.[http://www.www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/fighter/f15/ \"McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter\"]. aerospaceweb.org. Retrieved: 24 September 2010. This was one of the few times air-superiority F-15s (A/B/C/D models) were used in tactical strike missions.  Israeli air-superiority F-15 variants have since been extensively upgraded to carry a wider range of air-to-ground armaments, including JDAM GPS-guided bombs and Popeye missile.\n\nRoyal Saudi Air Force F-15C pilots reportedly shot down two Iranian Air Force F-4E Phantom IIs in a skirmish on 5 June 1984.Smith, William E.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951187,00.html?internalid=ACA \"Pushing the Saudis too far\"].

Retrieved: 26 January 2008.\n\nAnti-satellite trials\n\nThe ASM-135 missile was designed to be a standoff anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, with the F-15 acting as a first stage. The Soviet Union could correlate a U.S. rocket launch with a spy satellite loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights. From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon.Jenkins 1998, p. 31.[http://www.homestead.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id\n123068364 \"F-15A 76-0084\"].

During Gulf War combat against Iraqi forces, the F-15 accounted for 36 of the 39 air-to-air victories by the U.S. Air Force. Iraq has confirmed the loss of 23 of its aircraft in air-to-air combat.\"The First Night\" by Cooper, Sadik (IAPR, Vol.26) The F-15C and D fighters were used in the air superiority role while F-15E Strike Eagles were used in air-to-ground attacks mainly at night, hunting modified Scud missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.Davies 2002, pp. 31–40.  According to the USAF, its F-15Cs had 34 confirmed kills of Iraqi aircraft during the 1991 Gulf War, most of them by missile fire: five Mikoyan MiG-29s, two Mikoyan MiG-25s, eight Mikoyan MiG-23s, two MiG-21, two Sukhoi Su-25s, four Sukhoi Su-22, one Sukhoi Su-7, six Dassault Mirage F1s, one Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft, one Pilatus PC-9 trainer, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters. Air superiority was achieved in the first three days of the conflict; many of the later kills were reportedly of Iraqi aircraft fleeing to Iran, rather than engaging American aircraft. A Strike Eagle achieved an aerial kill of an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter with a laser-guided bomb. Two F-15Es were lost to ground fire, another was damaged on the ground by a Scud strike on King Abdulaziz Air Base.[http://www.1stfighter.com/history/1991.html#prof \"1st.

    "aggregatedText" : "The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) to gain and maintain air supremacy in aerial combat.   Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.Spick 2000, p. 127.\n\nThe Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft. Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability[https://www.scribd.com/doc/94122923/PS-940-F-15-Armament-Handbook-Oct-1979 \"PS 940 F-15 Armament Handbook, Oct-1979.\"] scribd.com. Retrieved: 29 November 2012. that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, an improved and enhanced version which was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations. As of 2017, the aircraft is being produced in different variants with production set to end in 2022.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nThe F-15 can trace its origins to the Vietnam War, when the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy fought over tactical aircraft being used in the war. At the time, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, even if there were performance sacrifices involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy were involved in the TFX (F-111) program, aiming to deliver a medium-range interdiction aircraft in Air Force use that would also serve as a long-range interceptor aircraft for the Navy.\n\nIn January 1965, Secretary McNamara asked the Air Force to consider a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and close air support to replace several types like the F-100 Super Sabre and various light bombers then in service. Two basic designs could fill this role; the Navy favored designs like the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II, pure attack aircraft, while the Air Force was more interested in fighters like the Northrop F-5, with a secondary attack capability. The former were more capable in the attack role, while the latter might be less so but could defend themselves. If the Air Force did choose an attack design, maintaining air superiority would be the priority. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to obsolete MiG-15s or MiG-17s on 4 April 1965.\n\nIn April 1965, Harold Brown, at that time director of the DDR&E, stated the favored position was to consider the F-5 and begin studies of the \"F-X\".\"F-X\" should be read as \"Fighter, Unknown designation number\", but is often translated as \"Fighter-Experimental\". These early studies envisioned a production run of 800 to 1,000 aircraft and stressed maneuvrability over speed; it also stated that the aircraft would not be considered without some level of ground attack capability. On 1 August, Gabriel Disosway took command of Tactical Air Command (TAC) and reiterated calls for the F-X, but lowered the required performance from Mach 3 to 2.5 to lower costs. Ultimately, the Air Force chose the A-7 over the F-5 for the support role on 5 November 1965,Munzenmaier, Walter. \"'LTV A-7D/K Corsair II: The 'SLUF' in USAF and USANG Service 1968–1993,\" Famous Aircraft of the USAF and USAG, Volume 1. giving further impetus for an air superiority design as the A-7 lacked any credible air-to-air capability.\n\nAn official requirements document was finalized in October, and sent out as a request for proposals (RFP) to 13 companies on 8 December 1965. Eight companies responded with proposals. Following a downselect, four companies were asked to provide further developments. In total, they developed some 500 design concepts. Typical designs featured variable-sweep wings, weighed over 60000 lb, included a top speed of Mach 2.7 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.75.Jenkins 1998, pp. 5–7. When the proposals were studied in July 1966, the aircraft were roughly the size and weight of the TFX, and like that aircraft, a design that could not be considered an air superiority fighter.\n\nSmaller, lighter\n\nThrough this period, studies of combat over Vietnam were producing worrying results. Theory had stressed long-range combat using missiles and optimized aircraft for this role. The result was highly loaded aircraft with large radar and excellent speed but limited maneuverability and often lacking a gun. The canonical example was the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, used by the USAF, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps to provide air superiority over Vietnam, the only fighter with enough power, range and maneuverability to be given the primary task of dealing with the threat of Soviet fighters while flying with visual engagement rules.\n\nIn practice, due to policy and practical reasons, aircraft were closing to visual range and maneuvering, placing the larger US aircraft at a disadvantage to the much less expensive day fighters like the MiG-21. Missiles proved to be much less reliable than predicted, especially at close range. Although improved training and the introduction of the M61 Vulcan cannon did much to address the disparity, these early outcomes led to considerable re-evaluation of the 1963 Project Forecast doctrine.Michael Gorn, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nl-cjq0nIJEsC&pg=PA45 \"Technology and the Air Force: A Retrospective Assessment\"], pp. 44–47. See also \"Harnessing the genie: science and technology forecasting for the Air Force\". This led to John Boyd's Energy–Maneuverability (E-M) theory, which stressed that extra power and maneuverability were key aspects of a successful fighter design and these were more important than outright speed. Through tireless championing of the concepts and good timing with the \"failure\" of the initial F-X project, the \"fighter mafia\" pressed for a lightweight day fighter that could be built and operated in large numbers in order to ensure air superiority. In early 1967, they proposed that the ideal design had a thrust-to-weight ratio of near 1:1, a maximum speed further reduced to Mach 2.3, a weight of 40000 lb and a wing loading of 80 lb/ft².\n\nBy this time, the Navy had decided the F-111 would not meet their requirements and began the development of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and see whether the VFAX would meet the Air Force's F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was now looking primarily for maneuverability.\n\nFocus on air superiority\n\nIn 1967 the Soviet Union revealed the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 at the Domodedovo airfield near Moscow.Davies 2002, pp. 9–11.\"In July 1967 at Domodedovo airfield near Moscow, the Soviet Union unveiled a new generation of combat aircraft… [codenamed] Foxbat by NATO\": \"Development\" in Modern Fighting Aircraft, 1983. The MiG-25 was designed as a high-speed, high-altitude interceptor aircraft and made many performance tradeoffs to excel in this role.Bowman 1980, p. 193. Among these was the requirement for very high speed, over Mach 2.8, which demanded the use of stainless steel instead of aluminum for many parts of the aircraft. The added weight demanded a much larger wing to allow the aircraft to operate at the required high altitudes. However, to observers, it appeared outwardly similar to the very large F-X studies: an aircraft with high speed and a large wing offering high maneuverability, leading to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense and the various arms that the US was being outclassed. The MiG-23 was likewise a subject of concern, and it was generally believed to be a better aircraft than the F-4. The F-X would outclass the MiG-23, but now it appeared that that MiG-25 would be superior in speed, ceiling and endurance to all existing US fighters, even the F-X. Thus, an effort to improve the F-X followed.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 12.\n\nBoth Headquarters USAF and the TAC continued to call for a multipurpose aircraft, while both Disosway and Air Chief of Staff Bruce K. Holloway pressed for a pure air-superiority design that would be able to meet the expected performance of the MiG-25. During the same period, the Navy had ended its VFAX program and instead accepted a proposal from Grumman Aircraft for a smaller and more maneuverable design known as VFX, later becoming the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. VFX was considerably closer to the evolving F-X requirements. The Air Force in-fighting was eventually ended by the worry that the Navy's VFAX would be forced on them; in May 1968 it was stated that \"We finally decided – and I hope there is no one who still disagrees – that this aircraft is going to be an air superiority fighter\".\n\nIn September 1968, a request for proposals (RFP) was released to major aerospace companies. These requirements called for single-seat fighter having a maximum take-off weight of 40000 lb for the air-to-air role with a maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of nearly 1:1 at mission weight.Jenkins 1998, pp. 8–10. It also called for a twin-engine arrangement, as it was believed that this would respond to throttle changes more rapidly and might offer commonality with the Navy's VFX program. However, details of the avionics were left largely undefined, as it was not clear whether to build a larger aircraft with a powerful radar that could detect the enemy at longer ranges, or alternatively a smaller aircraft that would make it more difficult for the enemy to detect it.\n\nFour companies submitted proposals, with the Air Force eliminating General Dynamics and awarding contracts to Fairchild Republic, North American Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas for the definition phase in December 1968. The companies submitted technical proposals by June 1969. The Air Force announced the selection of McDonnell Douglas on 23 December 1969.Jenkins 1998, pp. 9–11. The winning design resembled the twin-tailed F-14, but with fixed wings; both designs were based on configurations studied in wind-tunnel testing by NASA.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 14.\n\nThe Eagle's initial versions were the F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to \"F-15A\" and \"F-15B\"). These versions would be powered by new Pratt & Whitney F100 engines to achieve a combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25 mm Ford-Philco GAU-7 cannon with caseless ammunition suffered development problems. It was dropped in favor of the standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting surface. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.Spick 2000, pp. 130–131.\n\nThe F-15 has a \"look-down/shoot-down\" radar that can distinguish low-flying moving targets from ground clutter. The F-15 would use computer technology with new controls and displays to lower pilot workload and require only one pilot to save weight. Unlike the F-14 or F-4, the F-15 has only a single canopy frame with clear vision forward. The USAF introduced the F-15 as \"the first dedicated USAF air superiority fighter since the North American F-86 Sabre\".[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR939/MR939.ch5.pdf \"Chapter 5: Return of the Air Superiority Fighter\"]. A Half Century of U.S. Fighter Aircraft R&D. Santa Monica, California: RAND, 1998. .\n\nThe F-15 was favored by customers such as the Israel and Japan air arms. Criticism from the fighter mafia that the F-15 was too large to be a dedicated dogfighter and too expensive to procure in large numbers, led to the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, which led to the USAF General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the middle-weight Navy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.Jenkins 2000, pp. 1–8.\n\nFurther development\n\nThe single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered production in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year.Jenkins 1998, pp. 33–34. These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000), which included 2,000 lb (900 kg) of additional internal fuel, provisions for exterior conformal fuel tanks, and an increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 68,000 lb (30,700 kg). The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel, a full weapons load, conformal fuel tanks, and three external fuel tanks to be carried. The APG-63 radar uses a programmable signal processor (PSP), enabling the radar to be reprogrammable for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment. The PSP was the first of its kind in the world, and the upgraded APG-63 radar was the first radar to use it. Other improvements included strengthened landing gear, a new digital central computer,Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 115. and an overload warning system, which allows the pilot to fly up to 9 g at all weights.\n\nThe F-15 Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) was initiated in February 1983 with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set, allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120A missiles; and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 F-15Cs included the Hughes APG-70 radar developed for the F-15E; these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles. Earlier MSIP F-15Cs with the APG-63 were upgraded to the APG-63(V)1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG-70. Existing F-15s were retrofitted with these improvements.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 161–65.\n\nIn 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, Hughes, teamed to privately develop a strike fighter version of the F-15. This version competed in the Air Force's Dual-Role Fighter competition starting in 1982. The Boeing F-15E strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics' competing F-16XL in 1984.Davies 2003, pp. 15–16, 25, 31–32. Beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P&W F100-PW-220 engine and digital engine controls, providing quicker throttle response, reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption. Starting in 1997, original F100-PW-100 engines were upgraded to a similar configuration with the designation F100-PW-220E starting.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 168–69.\n\nBeginning in 2007, 178 USAF F-15Cs were retrofitted with the AN/APG-63(V)3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar.[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071009c_nr.html \"Boeing Awarded $70 Million Contract for Enhanced F-15C Radar.\"] Boeing, 9 October 2007.

Seen as a necessity because of the low numbers of F-22s procured, the upgrade builds upon the company's F-15SE Silent Eagle concept with low-observable features.  Most improvements focus on lethality including quad-pack munitions racks to double its missile load to 16, conformal fuel tanks for extended range, \"Talon HATE\" communications pod to communicate with 5th generation fighters, the APG-63(v)3 AESA radar, a long-range infrared search and track (IRST) sensor, and BAE Systems' Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) systems.[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-doubles-f-15c-missile-load-in-2040c-eagle-u-416766/ Boeing doubles F-15C missile load in '2040C' Eagle upgrade] – Flightglobal.com, 15 September 2015\n\nAs of 2017, production is set to end in 2022, 50 years after the type's first flight.\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe F-15 has an all-metal semi-monocoque fuselage with a large cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 suggests a modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.\n\nThe empennage is metal and composite construction, with twin aluminium/composite material honeycomb structure vertical stabilizers with boron-composite skin, resulting in an exceptionally thin tailplane and rudders.  Composite horizontal all-moving tails outboard of the vertical stabilizers move independently to provide roll control in some flight regimes.  The F-15 has a spine-mounted air brake and retractable tricycle landing gear. It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney F100 axial compressor turbofan engines with afterburners, mounted side-by-side in the fuselage and fed by intake ramps. The cockpit is mounted high in the forward fuselage with a one-piece windscreen and large canopy for increased visibility and a 360° field of view for the pilot.  The airframe began to incorporate advanced superplastically formed titanium components in the 1980s.\n\nThe F-15's maneuverability is derived from low wing loading (weight to wing area ratio) with a high thrust-to-weight ratio enabling the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed. The F-15 can climb to 30000 ft in around 60 seconds. The thrust output of the dual engines is greater than the aircraft's combat weight, so it has the ability to accelerate vertically. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so that one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat.Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 944. The A and C models are single-seat variants; these were the main air-superiority versions produced. B and D models add a second seat behind the pilot for training. E models use the second seat for a weapon systems officer. Visibly, the F-15 has a unique feature vis-à-vis other modern fighter aircraft: it does not have the distinctive turkey feather aerodynamic exhaust petals covering its engine nozzles.  This is because the petal design on the F-15 was problematic and could fall off in flight; therefore they were removed, resulting in a 3% aerodynamic drag increase.Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 46–47.\n\nAvionics\n\nA multi-mission avionics system includes a heads-up display (HUD), advanced radar, AN/ASN-109 inertial guidance system (INS), flight instruments, ultra high frequency (UHF) communications, and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) and instrument landing system (ILS) receivers. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic warfare system, Identification friend or foe (IFF) system, electronic countermeasures suite and a central digital computer.Gunston 1986, p. 194.\n\nThe head-up display projects, through a combiner, all essential flight information gathered by the integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit instruments.Huenecke 1987, pp. 227–30.\n\nThe F-15's versatile APG-63 and 70 pulse-Doppler radar systems can look up at high-flying targets and look-down/shoot-down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. These radars can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The APG-63 has a basic range of 100 mi.  The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15's electronic warfare system provides both threat warning (radar warning receiver) and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.Jenkins 1998, pp. 97–104.\n\nWeaponry and external stores\n\nA variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to release weapons effectively and safely, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.Huenecke 1987, pp. 232–236.\n\nThe Eagle can be armed with combinations of four different air-to-air weapons: AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles or AIM-120 AMRAAM advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder or AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun in the right wing root.Lambert 1993, p. 521.\n\nLow-drag conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) were developed for the F-15C and D models. They can be attached to the sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. These conformal tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel.Jenkins 1998, p. 111. These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks.Green and Swanborough 1998, p. 371. The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nUpgrades\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and deep interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded to include four multi-purpose cathode ray tube displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler aircraft flight control system permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system.Lambert 1993, p. 523. For low-altitude, high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution APG-70 radar and LANTIRN pods to provide thermography.\n\nThe APG-63(V)2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar has been retrofitted to 18 U.S. Air Force F-15C aircraft.[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/n19991208_992202.htm \"18 APG-63(V)2.\"] Fas.org, 8 December 1999. Retrieved: 30 December 2010. This upgrade includes most of the new hardware from the APG-63(V)1, but adds an AESA to provide increased pilot situation awareness. The AESA radar has an exceptionally agile beam, providing nearly instantaneous track updates and enhanced multi-target tracking capability. The APG-63(V)2 is compatible with current F-15C weapon loads and enables pilots to take full advantage of AIM-120 AMRAAM capabilities, simultaneously guiding multiple missiles to several targets widely spaced in azimuth, elevation, or range.\n\nThe most modern version is the F-15 Advanced, which features fly-by-wire controls.\n\nOperational history\n\nIntroduction and early service\n\nThe largest operator of the F-15 is the United States Air Force. The first Eagle, an F-15B, was delivered on 13 November 1974.Scutts 1989, p. 47. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron, the 555th TFS, was delivered. These initial aircraft carried the Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) APG-63 radar.\n\nThe first kill by an F-15 was scored by Israeli Air Force (IAF) ace Moshe Melnik in 1979. During Israeli raids against Palestinian factions in Lebanon in 1979–1981, F-15As reportedly downed 13 Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s and two Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25s. Israeli F-15As and Bs participated as escorts in Operation Opera, an air strike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor. In the 1982 Lebanon War, Israeli F-15s were credited with 41 Syrian aircraft destroyed (23 MiG-21s and 17 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, and one Aérospatiale SA.342L Gazelle helicopter).\n\nIsrael was the only operator to use and develop the air-to-ground abilities of the air-superiority F-15 variants, doing so because the fighter's range was well beyond other combat aircraft in the Israeli inventory in the 1980s. The first known use of F-15s for a strike mission was during Operation Wooden Leg on 1 October 1985, with six F-15Ds attacking PLO Headquarters in Tunis with two GBU-15 guided bombs per aircraft and two F-15Cs re-striking the ruins with six Mk-82 unguided bombs each.[http://www.www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/fighter/f15/ \"McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter\"]. aerospaceweb.org. Retrieved: 24 September 2010. This was one of the few times air-superiority F-15s (A/B/C/D models) were used in tactical strike missions.  Israeli air-superiority F-15 variants have since been extensively upgraded to carry a wider range of air-to-ground armaments, including JDAM GPS-guided bombs and Popeye missile.\n\nRoyal Saudi Air Force F-15C pilots reportedly shot down two Iranian Air Force F-4E Phantom IIs in a skirmish on 5 June 1984.Smith, William E.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951187,00.html?internalid=ACA \"Pushing the Saudis too far\"].

The Soviet Union could correlate a U.S. rocket launch with a spy satellite loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights. From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon.Jenkins 1998, p. 31.[http://www.homestead.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id\n123068364 \"F-15A 76-0084\"].

The program was officially terminated in 1988.\n\nGulf War and aftermath\n\nThe USAF began deploying F-15C, D and E model aircraft to the Persian Gulf region in August 1990 for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During Gulf War combat against Iraqi forces, the F-15 accounted for 36 of the 39 air-to-air victories by the U.S. Air Force. Iraq has confirmed the loss of 23 of its aircraft in air-to-air combat.\"The First Night\" by Cooper, Sadik (IAPR, Vol.26) The F-15C and D fighters were used in the air superiority role while F-15E Strike Eagles were used in air-to-ground attacks mainly at night, hunting modified Scud missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.Davies 2002, pp. 31–40.  According to the USAF, its F-15Cs had 34 confirmed kills of Iraqi aircraft during the 1991 Gulf War, most of them by missile fire: five Mikoyan MiG-29s, two Mikoyan MiG-25s, eight Mikoyan MiG-23s, two MiG-21, two Sukhoi Su-25s, four Sukhoi Su-22, one Sukhoi Su-7, six Dassault Mirage F1s, one Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft, one Pilatus PC-9 trainer, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters. Air superiority was achieved in the first three days of the conflict; many of the later kills were reportedly of Iraqi aircraft fleeing to Iran, rather than engaging American aircraft. A Strike Eagle achieved an aerial kill of an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter with a laser-guided bomb. Two F-15Es were lost to ground fire, another was damaged on the ground by a Scud strike on King Abdulaziz Air Base.[http://www.1stfighter.com/history/1991.html#prof \"1st.

All remaining combat coded F-15Cs and F-15Ds are operated by the Air National Guard.\n\nThe USAF is upgrading 178 F-15C/Ds with the AN/APG-63(V)3 AESA radar, and equipping other F-15s with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System as of 2006. In 2007, the Air Force planned to keep 178 F-15C/Ds along with 224 F-15Es in service beyond 2025.\n\nAs part of the Air Force's FY 2015 budget, the F-15C faced cuts or retirement in response to sequestration.  Cuts are principally directed at platforms with single-mission capabilities.  The retirement of some of the 250 F-15C fighters would save maintenance and upgrade costs, which could be redirected to speed procurement of the F-35 Lightning II.  The air-to-air combat role would be taken up preeminently by the F-22 Raptor, while the F-35 would support it in conjunction with the Raptor.  Even if this option is pursued, at least part of the F-15C fleet is likely to be preserved.[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130915/DEFREG02/309150004 \"USAF weighs scrapping KC-10, A-10 fleets.\"] Defensenews.com.
