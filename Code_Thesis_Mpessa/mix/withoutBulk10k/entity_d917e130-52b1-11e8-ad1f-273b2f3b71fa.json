  "textBody" : "Circe (; ( Kírkē) is a goddess of magic or sometimes a nymph, witch, enchantress or sorceress in Greek mythology. By most accounts, she was the daughter of the sun titan Helios, and Perse, one of the three thousand Oceanid nymphs. Her brothers were Aeetes, keeper of the Golden Fleece, and Perses. Her sister was Pasiphaë, the wife of King Minos and mother of the Minotaur.Homer, Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHom.+Od.+10.135&fromdoc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.135]; Hesiod, Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHes.+Th.+956&fromdoc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 956]; Apollodorus, Library [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D1 1.9.1]; Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica . Other accounts make her the daughter of Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft.Grimal; Smith  She was often confused with Calypso, due to her shifts in behavior and personality, and the association that both of them had with Odysseus.\n\nCirce was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs. Through the use of these and a magic wand or staff, she transformed her enemies, or those who offended her, into wild beasts. Some say she was exiled to the solitary island of Aeaea by her subjects and her father Helios for killing her husband, the prince of Colchis. Later traditions tell of her leaving or even destroying the island and moving to Italy, where she was identified with Cape Circeo.\n\nSources\n\nHomer's Odyssey\n\nIn Homer's Odyssey, Circe is described as living in a mansion that stands in the middle of a clearing in a dense wood. Around the house prowled strangely docile lions and wolves, the drugged victims of her sorcery;Homer, Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHom.+Od.+10.212&fromdoc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.212ff]. they were not dangerous, and fawned on all newcomers. Circe worked at a huge loom.Refer Weaving (mythology). She invited Odysseus' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also laced with one of her magical potions and drunk from an enchanted cup. Thus so she turned them all into swine with her magic wand or staff after they gorged themselves on it. Only drunken Eurylochus, suspecting treachery from the outset, escaped to warn Odysseus and the others who had stayed behind at the ship. Odysseus set out to rescue his men, but was intercepted by the messenger god, Hermes, who had been sent by Athena. Hermes told Odysseus to use the herb moly to protect himself from Circe's wizardry and, having resisted it, to draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her. From there, Circe would ask him to bed, but Hermes advised caution, for even there the goddess would be treacherous. She would take his manhood unless he had her swear by the names of the gods that she would not.\n\nOdysseus followed Hermes' advice, freeing his men and then remained on the island for one year, feasting and drinking wine. According to Homer, Circe suggested two alternative routes to Odysseus to return to Ithaca: toward Planctae, the \"Wandering Rocks\", or passing between the dangerous Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, conventionally identified with the Strait of Messina. She also advised Odysseus to go to the Underworld and gave him directions.Homer, Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475—541].\n\nLater Greek literature\n\nTowards the end of Hesiod's Theogony (1011ff.), it is stated that Circe bore Odysseus three sons: Ardeas or Agrius (otherwise unknown); Latinus; and Telegonus, who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the Etruscans. The Telegony (Τηλεγόνεια), an epic now lost, relates the later history of the last of these. Circe eventually informed him who his absent father was and, when he set out to find Odysseus, gave him a poisoned spear. With this he killed his father unknowingly. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse, together with Penelope and Odysseus' other son Telemachus, to Aeaea. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the others immortal. According to Lycophron's Alexandra (808) and  John Tzetzes' scholia on the poem (795 - 808), however, Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then gave Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone in marriage. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief.\n\nDionysius of Halicarnassus (1.72.5) cites Xenagoras, the second century BC historian, as claiming that Odysseus and Circe had three sons: Rhomus, Anteias, and Ardeias, who respectively founded three cities called by their names: Rome, Antium, and Ardea. In a very late Alexandrian epic from the 5th century AD, the Dionysiaca of Nonnus, her son by Poseidon is mentioned under the name of Phaunos.Timothy Peter Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth, Cambridge University 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id7LPNHRUlWacC&lpg\nPA48&ots-_sY_Y5iRY&dq\nPhaunos%20Circe&pgPA47#v\nonepage&qPhaunos%20Circe&f\nfalse pp 47-8]\n\nIn the 3rd century BC epic, the Argonautica, Apollonius Rhodius relates that Circe purified the Argonauts for the death of Absyrtus,\"They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirké should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica, iv.586-88, in Peter Grean's translation). maybe reflecting an early tradition.See the ancient concept of miasma, a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705-17, The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios, (1997, 2007) p 322. In this poem, the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval ‘beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs.’\n\nThree ancient plays about Circe have been lost: the work of the tragedian Aeschylus and of the 4th century BC comic dramatists Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. The first told the story of Odysseus' encounter with Circe. Vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual Satyrs. Fragments of Anaxilas also mention the transformation and one of the characters complains of the impossibility of scratching his face now that he is a pig.John E. Thorburn, FOF Companion to Classical Drama, New York 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?idk3NnUyqzRNYC&lpg\nPA138&otssq7kt-2MFW&dq\nAeschylus%2C%20%22Circe%22%20%20%22fragment%22&pgPA138#v\nonepage&qCirce&f\nfalse p.138]\n\nLatin literature\n\nThe theme of turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers, especially in Latin. In Virgil's Aeneid, Aeneas skirts the Italian island where Circe now dwells, and hears the cries of her many male victims, who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts:\n\"The roars of lions that refuse the chain,\nThe grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, \nAnd herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.\"\n\nOvid's Metamorphoses collects more transformation stories in its 14th book. The fourth episode covers Circe's encounter with Ulysses (lines 242-307). The first episode in that book deals with the story of Glaucus and Scylla, in which the enamoured sea-god seeks a love filtre to win Scylla's love, only to have the sorceress fall in love with him. When she is unsuccessful, she takes revenge on her rival by turning Scylla into a monster (lines 1-74). The story of the Latin king Picus is told in the fifth episode (and also alluded to in the Aeneid). Circe fell in love with him too; when he preferred to remain faithful to his wife Canens, she turned him into a woodpecker (lines 308-440).\n\nThe gens Mamilia - described by Titus Livius as one of the most distinguished families of LatiumDictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyTitus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, 1:49 - claimed descent from Mamilia, a granddaughter of Odysseus and Circe through Telegonus. One of the most well known of them was Octavius Mamilius (died 498 BC), princeps of Tusculum and son-in-law of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus the seventh and last king of Rome.\n\nMedieval and modern literature\n\nGiovanni Boccaccio provided a digest of what was known of Circe during the Middle Ages in his De mulieribus claris (Famous Women, 1361-1362). While following the tradition that she lived in Italy, he comments wryly that there are now many more temptresses like her to lead men astray.tr.

Ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than Circe and through this means he leaves her pregnant with Telegonus. Most of the account deals with the son's later quest for and accidental killing of his father, drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery.John Gower, English Works,  [https://archive.org/stream/completeworksofj03goweuoft#page/204/mode/2up 6.1391-1788]; there is also a [http://www.ellinanderson.com/Circe%20and%20Ulysses.html modern translation] by Ellin Anderson\n\nThe story of Ulysses and Circe was retold as an episode in Georg Rollenhagen's German verse epic, Froschmeuseler (The frogs and mice, Magdeburg, 1595).

Early philosophical questions were also raised whether the change from a reasoning being to a beast was not preferable after all, and this paradox was to have a powerful impact in the Renaissance. In later Christian opinion, Circe was an abominable witch using miraculous powers to evil ends. When the existence of witches came to be questioned, she was reinterpreted as a depressive suffering from delusions.“Disbelieving in Witchcraft: Allori’s Melancholic Circe in the Palazzo Salviati,” Athanor 22 (2004), [https://www.academia.edu/7199809/_Disbelieving_in_Witchcraft_Allori_s_Melancholic_Circe_in_the_Palazzo_Salviati._Athanor_22_2004_57-65 pp. 57-65] Circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female until her cause was taken up by women authors, who raised the question of whether this view had more to do with male fantasies than with the truth.\n\nWestern paintings established a visual iconography for the figure, but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning Circe that appear in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The episodes of Scylla and Picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire. Later male interpretations were to take the metamorphoses she inflicted not just as reflecting a temptation to bestiality but as an emasculatory threat.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nScientific interpretations\n\nIn botany the Circaea are plants belonging to the enchanter's nightshade genus. The name was given by botanists in the late 16th century in the belief that this was the herb used by Circe to charm Odysseus' companions.[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/enchanter's%2Bnightshade Oxford Dictionary]   Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to anticholinergic intoxication with the plant Datura stramonium. Symptoms include amnesia, hallucinations, and delusions. The description of \"moly\" fits the snowdrop, a flower that contains galantamine, which is a long lasting anticholinesterase and can therefore counteract anticholinergics that are introduced to the body after it has been consumed.\n\nOther influence\n\n*The Circe Effect, coined by the enzymologist William Jencks, refers to a scenario where an enzyme lures its substrate towards it through electrostatic forces exhibited by the enzyme molecule before transforming it into a product. Where this takes place, the catalytic velocity (rate of reaction) of the enzyme may be significantly faster than that of others.\n*Linnaeus named a genus of the Venus clams (Veneridae) after Circe in 1778 (species Circe scripta (Linnaeus, 1758) and others).[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?ptaxdetails&id\n216564 Species details]; there are pictures on the [http://www.conchology.be/?t65&family\nVENERIDAE Conchology site]\n*Her name has been given to 34 Circe, a large, dark main-belt asteroid first sighted in 1855.\n*There are a variety of chess variants named Circe in which captured pieces are reborn on their starting positions.

When the existence of witches came to be questioned, she was reinterpreted as a depressive suffering from delusions.“Disbelieving in Witchcraft: Allori’s Melancholic Circe in the Palazzo Salviati,” Athanor 22 (2004), [https://www.academia.edu/7199809/_Disbelieving_in_Witchcraft_Allori_s_Melancholic_Circe_in_the_Palazzo_Salviati._Athanor_22_2004_57-65 pp. 57-65] Circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female until her cause was taken up by women authors, who raised the question of whether this view had more to do with male fantasies than with the truth.\n\nWestern paintings established a visual iconography for the figure, but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning Circe that appear in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The episodes of Scylla and Picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire. Later male interpretations were to take the metamorphoses she inflicted not just as reflecting a temptation to bestiality but as an emasculatory threat.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nScientific interpretations\n\nIn botany the Circaea are plants belonging to the enchanter's nightshade genus. The name was given by botanists in the late 16th century in the belief that this was the herb used by Circe to charm Odysseus' companions.[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/enchanter's%2Bnightshade Oxford Dictionary]   Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to anticholinergic intoxication with the plant Datura stramonium. Symptoms include amnesia, hallucinations, and delusions. The description of \"moly\" fits the snowdrop, a flower that contains galantamine, which is a long lasting anticholinesterase and can therefore counteract anticholinergics that are introduced to the body after it has been consumed.\n\nOther influence\n\n*The Circe Effect, coined by the enzymologist William Jencks, refers to a scenario where an enzyme lures its substrate towards it through electrostatic forces exhibited by the enzyme molecule before transforming it into a product. Where this takes place, the catalytic velocity (rate of reaction) of the enzyme may be significantly faster than that of others.\n*Linnaeus named a genus of the Venus clams (Veneridae) after Circe in 1778 (species Circe scripta (Linnaeus, 1758) and others).[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?ptaxdetails&id\n216564 Species details]; there are pictures on the [http://www.conchology.be/?t65&family\nVENERIDAE Conchology site]\n*Her name has been given to 34 Circe, a large, dark main-belt asteroid first sighted in 1855.\n*There are a variety of chess variants named Circe in which captured pieces are reborn on their starting positions. The rules for this were formulated in 1968. Circe. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5956."
