  "textBody" : "Blitz BASIC refers to the programming language dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by New Zealand-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program.  The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as object-orientation and multi-threading.  This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first iteration of the Blitz language was created for the Amiga platform and published by the Australian firm Memory and Storage Technology.  Returning to New Zealand, Blitz BASIC 2 was published several years later by Acid Software (a local Amiga game publisher).  Since then, Blitz compilers have been released on several platforms. Following the demise of the Amiga as a commercially viable platform, the Blitz BASIC 2 source code was released to the Amiga community. Development continues to this day under the name AmiBlitz.\n\nBlitzBasic \n\nIdigicon published BlitzBasic for Microsoft Windows in October 2000.  The language included a built-in API for performing basic 2D graphics and audio operations. Following the release of Blitz3D, BlitzBasic is often synonymously referred to as Blitz2D.\n\nRecognition of BlitzBasic increased when a limited range of \"free\" versions were distributed in popular UK computer magazines such as PC Format. This resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually resolved amicably.\n\nBlitzPlus \n\nIn February 2003, Blitz Research Ltd. released BlitzPlus also for Microsoft Windows. It lacked the 3D engine of Blitz3D, but did bring new features to the 2D side of the language by implementing limited Microsoft Windows control support for creating native GUIs.  Backwards compatibility of the 2D engine was also extended, allowing compiled BlitzPlus games and applications to run on systems that might only have DirectX 1.\n\nBlitzMax \n\nThe first BlitzMax compiler was released in December 2004 for Mac OS X. This made it the first Blitz dialect that could be compiled on *nix platforms. Compilers for Microsoft Windows and Linux were subsequently released in May 2005. BlitzMax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of Blitz products by extending the type system to include object-oriented concepts and modifying the graphics API to better suit OpenGL. BlitzMax was also the first of the Blitz languages to represent strings internally using UCS2, allowing native-support for string literals composed of non-ASCII characters.\n\nBlitzMax's platform-agnostic command-set allows developers to compile and run source code on multiple platforms. However the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on. Unofficially, users have been able to get Linux and Mac OS X to cross-compile to the Windows platform.\n\nBlitzMax is also the first modular version of the Blitz languages, improving the extensibility of the command-set. In addition, all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are open-source and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary. The official BlitzMax cross-platform GUI module (known as MaxGUI) allows developers to write GUI interfaces for their applications on Linux (FLTK), Mac (Cocoa) and Windows. Various user-contributed modules extend the use of the language by wrapping such libraries as wxWidgets, Cairo, and Fontconfig as well as a selection of database modules. There are also a selection of third-party 3D modules available namely MiniB3D - an open-source OpenGL engine which can be compiled and used on all three of BlitzMax's supported platforms.\n\nIn October 2007, BlitzMax 1.26 was released which included the addition of a reflection module.  BlitzMax 1.32 shipped new threading and Lua scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are unicode friendly.[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 BlitzMax V132 for Windows and MacIntel now up!] on blitzbasic.com\n\nBlitz3D SDK \n\nBlitz3D SDK is a 3D graphics engine based on the engine in Blitz3D. It was marketed for use with C++, C#, BlitzMax and PureBasic, however it could also be used with other languages that follow compatible calling conventions.\n\nMax3D module \n\nIn 2008, the source code to Max3D - a C++-based cross-platform 3D engine - was released under a BSD license. This engine focused on OpenGL but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers (such as DirectX) and made use of several open-source libraries, namely Assimp, Boost and ODE.\n\nDespite the excitement in the Blitz community of Max3D being the eagerly awaited successor to Blitz3D, interest and support died off soon after the source code was released and eventually development came to a halt. There is no indication that Blitz Research will pick up the project again.\n\nOpen-source release \n\nBlitzPlus was released as Open Source on 28 April 2014 under the zlib license on github.com.[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php BlitzPlus Source Code Released] by simonh (2014-04-29)[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907 Blitz3D open sourced!]  on Blitz3D Forums by (2014) Blitz3D followed soon after and was released as Open Source on 3 August 2014.[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php Blitz3D Now Free and Open Source!] by simonh (2014-08-03)[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d blitz3d] on github.com BlitzMax was later released as Open Source on 21 September 2015.[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzmax blitzmax] on github.com\n\nSample code\n\nThe following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format.
