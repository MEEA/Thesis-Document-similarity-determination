  "textBody" : "In particle physics, the electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four known  fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction. Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force. Above the unification energy, on the order of 246 GeV, they would merge into a single electroweak force. Thus, if the universe is hot enough (approximately 1015 K, a temperature exceeded until shortly after the Big Bang), then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force. During the quark epoch, the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force.\n\nSheldon Glashow, Abdus SalamGlashow, S. (1959). \"The renormalizability of vector meson interactions.\" Nucl. Phys. 10, 107., and Steven Weinberg were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles.\n\n The existence of the electroweak interactions was experimentally established in two stages, the first being the discovery of neutral currents in neutrino scattering by the Gargamelle collaboration in 1973, and the second in 1983 by the UA1 and the UA2 collaborations that involved the discovery of the W and Z gauge bosons in proton–antiproton collisions at the converted Super Proton Synchrotron. In 1999, Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman were awarded the Nobel prize for showing that the electroweak theory is renormalizable.\n\nFormulation\n\nMathematically, the unification is accomplished under an SU(2) × U(1) gauge group. The corresponding gauge bosons are the three W bosons of weak isospin from SU(2) (W1, W2, and W3), and the B boson of weak hypercharge from U(1), respectively, all of which are massless.\n\nIn the Standard Model, the  and  bosons, and the photon, are produced by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak symmetry from SU(2) × U(1)Y to U(1)em, caused by the Higgs mechanism (see also Higgs boson).\n\n U(1)Y and U(1)em are different copies of U(1); the generator of U(1)em is given by Q = Y/2 + T3, where Y is the generator of U(1)Y (called the weak hypercharge), and T3 is one of the SU(2) generators (a component of weak isospin).\n\nThe spontaneous symmetry breaking  makes the 3 and  bosons coalesce  into two different bosons – the  boson, and the photon (),\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma \\\\\nZ^0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta_W & \\sin \\theta_W \\\\\n-\\sin \\theta_W & \\cos \\theta_W \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\nB \\\\\nW_3 \\end{pmatrix} \n\nwhere  is the weak mixing angle. The axes representing the particles have essentially just been rotated, in the (W3, B) plane, by the angle . This also introduces a  mismatch between the mass of the  and the mass of the  particles (denoted as  and , respectively),\nM_Z=\\frac{M_W}{\\cos\\theta_W}.\n\nThe  and  bosons, in turn, combine to give massive charged bosons\nW^{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(W_1\\mp i W_2).\n\nThe distinction between electromagnetism and the weak force arises because there is a (nontrivial) linear combination of Y and T3 that vanishes for the Higgs boson (it is an eigenstate of both Y and T3, so the coefficients may be taken as −T3 and Y):  U(1)em is defined to be the group generated by this linear combination, and is unbroken because it does not interact with the Higgs.\n\nLagrangian\n\nBefore electroweak symmetry breaking\n\nThe Lagrangian for the electroweak interactions is divided into four parts before electroweak symmetry breaking\n\\mathcal{L}_{EW} = \\mathcal{L}_g + \\mathcal{L}_f + \\mathcal{L}_h + \\mathcal{L}_y.\n\nThe \\mathcal{L}_g term describes the interaction between the three W particles and the B particle.\n\\mathcal{L}_g = -\\frac{1}{4}W_{a}^{\\mu\\nu}W_{\\mu\\nu}^a - \\frac{1}{4}B^{\\mu\\nu}B_{\\mu\\nu},\nwhere W^{a\\mu\\nu} (a=1,2,3) and B^{\\mu\\nu} are the field strength tensors for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.\n\n\\mathcal{L}_f is the kinetic term for the Standard Model fermions.
