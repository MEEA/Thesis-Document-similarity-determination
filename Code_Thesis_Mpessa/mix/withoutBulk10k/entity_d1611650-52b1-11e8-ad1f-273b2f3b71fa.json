  "textBody" : "In elementary number theory, Bézout's identity (also called Bézout's lemma) is the following theorem:\n\nThe integers x and y are called Bézout coefficients for (a, b); they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. If both a and b are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that |x|\\le \\left |\\frac{b}{d}\\right | and |y|\\le\\left |\\frac{a}{d}\\right |\n(equality may occur only if one of a and b is a multiple of the other).\n\nMany other theorems in elementary number theory, such as  Euclid's lemma or Chinese remainder theorem, result from Bézout's identity.\n\nA Bézout domain is an integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds. In particular, Bézout's identity holds in principal ideal domains. Every theorem that results from Bézout's identity is thus true in all these domains.\n\nStructure of solutions\n\nWhen one pair of Bézout coefficients (x, y) has been computed (e.g., using extended Euclidean algorithm), all pairs can be represented in the form\n\\left(x+k\\frac{b}{\\gcd(a,b)},\\ y-k\\frac{a}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right),\nwhere  is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.\n\nAmong these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy \n |x| \\le \\left |\\frac{b}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right |\\quad \\text{and}\\quad |y| \\le \\left |\\frac{a}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right |,\nand equality may occur only if one of  and  divides the other.\n\nThis relies on a property of Euclidean division: given two integers c and d, if d does not divide c, there is exactly one pair  such that  and , and another one such that  and .\n\nThe two pairs of small Bézout's coefficients are obtained by choosing  in the above formula for getting either remainder of the division of  by b/\\gcd(a,b). \n\nThe Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.\n\nExample\n\nLet a 12 and b \n 42, gcd (12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following Bézout's identities, with the Bézout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\vdots \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{-10} & + \\;\\; 42  &\\times \\color{blue}{3} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{red}{-3} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{red}{1} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{red}{4}  & + \\;\\;42  &\\times\\color{red}{-1} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{11} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{blue}{-3} &= 6 \\\\\n12 &\\times \\color{blue}{18} & + \\;\\;42  &\\times \\color{blue}{-5} &= 6 \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{align}\n\nProof\n\nGiven some integers  and , let S=\\{ax+by \\mid x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}. The set  contains positive integers, as it contains  and . Let \nd as + bt be the smallest positive integer in . For proving that  is the greatest common divisor of  and , it suffices to prove that  is a common divisor of  and , since all elements of , including , are divisible by the greatest common divisor. In fact any common divisor of  and  divides also as + bt\nd, and thus cannot be greater than .\n\nThe Euclidean division of  by  may be written\na=dq+r\\quad\\text{with}\\quad 0\\le r\nThe remainder  is in , because\n\n\\begin{align}\nr  & = a - qd \\\\\n& = a - q(as+bt)\\\\\n& = a(1-qs) - bqt.\n\\end{align}\n\nAs  is the smallest positive integer in , the remainder  is necessarily 0, and this implies that  is a divisor of . Similarly  is also a divisor of , and this completes the proof.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nFor three or more integers\n\nBézout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if \n\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) = d\n\nthen there are integers x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n such that\n\nd = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n\n\nhas the following properties:\n* d is the smallest positive integer of this form\n* every number of this form is a multiple of d\n\nFor polynomials\n\nBézout's identity works for univariate polynomials over a field exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nAs the common roots of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity and fundamental theorem of algebra imply the following result: \nFor univariate polynomials f and g with coefficients in a field, there exist polynomials a and b such that af + bg = 1 if and only if f and g have no common root in any algebraically closed field (commonly the field of complex numbers).\n\nThe generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.\n\nFor principal ideal domains\n\nAs noted in the introduction, Bézout's identity works not only in the ring of integers, but also in any other principal ideal domain (PID).\nThat is, if R is a PID, and a and b are elements of R, and d is a greatest common divisor of a and b,\nthen there are elements x and y in R such that ax + by = d. The reason: the ideal Ra+Rb is principal and indeed is equal to Rd.\n\nAn integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a Bézout domain.\n\nHistory\n\nFrench mathematician Étienne Bézout (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials.
