  "textBody" : "Although Haiti averages approximately 255 people per square kilometer (650 per sq. mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. The nation is multi-ethnic, home to peoples of different races and ethnic groups. 95% of Haitians are of predominantly African descent. The remaining 5% of the population is primarily mulattoes, Europeans, Asians and Arabs. Hispanic residents in Haiti are mostly Cuban and Dominican.  About two thirds of the Haitian population live in rural areas.\n\nAlthough there was a national census taken in Haiti in 2003, much of that data has not been released to the public. Several demographic studies, including those by social work researcher Athena Kolbe, have shed light on the current status of urban residents. In 2006, households averaged 4.5 members. The median age was 25 years with a mean average age of 27 years. People aged 15 and younger counted for roughly a third of the population. Overall, 52.7 percent of the population was female.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to  the total population was  in , compared to 3,221,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.2%, 59.7% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.5% was 65 years or older\n.  According to the World Bank, Haiti's dependency rate is 7.51 dependents per 100 working age persons.\n\nStructure of the population  \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2010) (Estimates) :\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2011) (Estimates) :\n\nStructure of the population (DHS 2012) (Males 28 122, Females 29 844 = 57 966) :\n\nVital statistics\n\nRegistration of vital events in Haiti is not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.\n\nWhile limited, evidence suggests that disasters can cause human populations to increase in the long term, rather than decrease. Documented fertility spikes followed the Khmer Rouge conflict and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami - potential causes may include reduced access to contraception and families desiring more children following child death.Frankenberg, Laurito & Thomas, Duke University, 2014, [https://ipl.econ.duke.edu/dthomas/docs/ppr/14Jun-Disaster.pdf The Demography of Disasters]  In Haiti's case, the fertility rate nearly tripled after the quake, and is likely to remain elevated (above pre-quake levels) for long after.\n\nBirths and deaths\n\nNumber of births and deaths are calculated - based on Crude Birth and Death Rates.\n\nFertility and births\n\nThe Total Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\n\nLanguages\n\nTaíno was the major pre-Columbian language in the region of what is Haiti (or Hayti), a name rooted in the language to refer to the entire island of Hispaniola to mean, \"land of high mountains.\"\n\nToday, the Republic of Haiti has two official languages. They are French and Haitian Creole; the latter, a French-based creole where 90% of its vocabulary is derived from, with influences from Portuguese, Spanish, Taíno, and West African languages. French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.À ce propos, voir l'essai Prétendus Créolismes : le couteau dans l'igname, Jean-Robert Léonidas, Cidihca, Montréal 1995 It is spoken by most educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.\n\nHaiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements, or collectivités, of France. Haitian Creole, which has recently undergone a standardization, is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti. It is related to the other French creoles, but most closely to Antillean Creole and Louisiana Creole variants.\n\nSpanish, though not official, is spoken by a growing amount of the population, and is spoken more frequently near the border with the Dominican Republic. English is increasingly spoken among the young and in the business sector.\n\nReligion\n\nThe state religion is Roman Catholicism which 80–85% of the population professes. 15–20% of Haitians practice Protestantism. Only a very  small percentage of the population practice Vodou, mostly along with another religion.\n\nEducation\n\nAlthough public education at the primary level is now free, private and parochial schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered.\n\nIn recent years, several annual literacy campaigns launched in by the Martelly administration has increased overall literacy among adults in Haiti. UNESCO projects an overall literacy rate of 61.1% in Haiti by 2015.\nAs of December 2014, World bank has reported that school enrollment has increased from 78% to 90% in Haiti, very close to the goal of universal child enrollment.\n\nLabor\n\nIn 2004, 300,000 children were restavecs, the practice of which is comparable to indentured service of minors.\n\nEmigration\n\nLarge-scale emigration, principally to the Dominican Republic, United States, and Canada (predominantly to Quebec, with other areas of the country) – but also to Cuba, other areas of Europe and the Americas (like Argentina) such as France (with French Guiana), Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Ireland; and Venezuela, Brazil, the Bahamas and other Caribbean neighbors – has created what Haitians refer to as the Eleventh Department or the Diaspora.
