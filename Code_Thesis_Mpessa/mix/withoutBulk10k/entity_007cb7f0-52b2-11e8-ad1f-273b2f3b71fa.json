  "textBody" : "Greenland is located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. The territory comprises the island of Greenland–the largest island in the world–and more than a hundred other smaller islands (see alphabetic list). As an island, Greenland has no land boundaries and 44,087 km of coastline. A sparse population is confined to small settlements along certain sectors of the coast. Greenland possesses the world's second largest ice sheet.\n\nGreenland sits atop the Greenland plate, a subplate of the North American plate. The Greenland craton is made up of some of the oldest rocks on the face of the earth. The Isua greenstone belt in southwestern Greenland contains the oldest known rocks on Earth, dated at 3.7–3.8 billion years old.Appel, Peter W.U., Hugh R. Rollinson, and Jacques L.R. Touret. (2001) \"Remnants of an Early Archaean (>3.75 Ga) sea-floor, hydrothermal system in the Isua Greenstone Belt.\" Precambrian Research, 112.1–2, 15 November, pp. 27–49.\n\nThe vegetation is generally sparse, with the only patch of forested land being found in Nanortalik Municipality in the extreme south near Cape Farewell.\n\nThe climate is arctic to subarctic, with cool summers and cold winters. The terrain is mostly a flat but gradually sloping icecap that covers all land except for a narrow, mountainous, barren, rocky coast. The lowest elevation is sea level and the highest elevation is the summit of Gunnbjørn Fjeld, the highest point in the Arctic at 3694 m. The northernmost point of the Island of Greenland is Cape Morris Jesup, allegedly discovered by Admiral Robert Peary in 1909. Natural resources include zinc, lead, iron ore, coal, molybdenum, gold, platinum, uranium, hydropower and fish.\n\nArea\n\ntotal:\n2,166,086 km²\n\nland:\n2,166,086 km² (410,449 km² ice-free, 1,755,637 km² ice-covered)\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nterritorial sea:\n3 nmi\n\nexclusive fishing zone:\n200 nmi\n\nLand use\n\narable land:\napproximately 6% ; some land is used to grow silage.\npermanent crops:\napproximately 0%\nother:\n100% (2012 est.)\n\nTotal population 56,000 inhabitants of whom ca. 15,000 live in the capital Nuuk.\n\nNatural hazards\n\nContinuous ice sheet covers 84% of the country; the rest is permafrost.\n\nEnvironment – current issues\n\nProtection of the Arctic environment, climate change, pollution of the food chain, excessive hunting [http://www.ecoadvise.dk/news] of endangered species (walrus, polar bears, narwhal, beluga whale and several sea birds).\n\nClimate\n\nThe Greenland ice sheet is 3 km thick and broad enough to blanket an area the size of Mexico. The ice is so massive that its weight presses the bedrock of Greenland below sea level and is so all-concealing that not until recently did scientists discover Greenland's Grand Canyon or the possibility that Greenland might actually be three islands.Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2006, [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/25/science/sci-greenland25 \"Greenland's Ice Sheet Is Slip-Sliding Away\"]\n\nIf the ice melted, the interior bedrock below sea level would be covered by water. It is not clear whether this water would be at sea level or a lake above sea level. If it would be at sea level it could connect to the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, in Baffin Bay and near Nordostrundingen, creating three large islands.[http://www.cejournal.net/?p=4225 Is the world’s fastest-moving glacier set to speed up even more?] But it is most likely that it would be a lake with one drain.\n\nIt is thought that before the Ice Age Greenland had mountainous edges, and a lowland (and probably very dry) center which drained to the sea by one big river flowing out westwards past where Disko Island is now.\n\nThere is concern about sea level rise caused by ice loss (melt and glaciers falling into the sea) on Greenland. Between 1997 and 2003 ice loss was 68 -, compared to about 60 km3/a for 1993/4-1998/9. Half of the increase was from higher summer melting, with the rest caused by velocities of some glaciers exceeding those needed to balance upstream snow accumulation (Krabill et al., L24402, GRL 2004). A complete loss of ice on Greenland would cause a sea level rise of as much as .\n\nResearchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Kansas reported in February 2006 that the glaciers are melting twice as fast as they were five years ago. By 2005, Greenland was beginning to lose more ice volume than anyone expected – an annual loss of up to 52 cumi per year, according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL. The increased ice loss may be partially offset by increased snow accumulation due to increased precipitation.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2006, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) found that the average winter temperature had risen almost 10 F-change.\n\nRecently, Greenland's three largest outlet glaciers have started moving faster, satellite data show. These are the Jakobshavn Isbræ at Ilulissat on the western edge of Greenland, and the Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim glaciers on the eastern edge of Greenland. The two latter accelerated greatly during the years 2004–2005, but returned to pre-2004 velocities in 2006.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1138478v1 Rapid Changes in Ice Discharge from Greenland Outlet Glaciers – Howat et al., 10.1126/science.1138478 – Science] The accelerating ice flow has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in seismic activity. In March 2006, researchers at Harvard University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University reported that the glaciers now generate swarms of earthquakes up to magnitude 5.0.\n\nThe retreat of Greenland's ice is revealing islands that were thought to be part of the mainland. In September 2005 Dennis Schmitt discovered an island 400 mi north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland which he named Uunartoq Qeqertaq, Inuit for \"warming island\".[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/science/earth/16gree.html?ex1326603600&en\nb018c85a1b03d90f&ei5090&partner\nrssuserland&emc=rss The Warming of Greenland], New York Times, January 16, 2007\n\nFuture Projections \n\nIn the Arctic, temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. Greenland is losing 200 billion tonnes of ice per year. Research suggests that this could increase the sea levels to rise by 30 centimeters by the end of the century. These projections have the possibility of changing as satellite data only traces back to 40 years ago. This means that researchers must view old photographs of glaciers and compare them to ones taken today to determine the future of Greenland's ice.http://www.nature.com/news/180-000-forgotten-photos-reveal-the-future-of-greenland-s-ice-1.20335, \"Nature\", July 27, 2016\n\nExtreme points\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Greenland, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\nTerritory of Greenland\n\n* Northernmost Point — Kaffeklubben Island (83°40'N) – the northernmost permanent land in the world.
