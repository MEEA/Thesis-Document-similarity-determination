The Washington Post, The Buffalo News.

By the age of 19, he had changed his professional name to Albert Brooks, joking that \"the real Albert Einstein changed his name to sound more intelligent\".  He began a comedy career that quickly made him a regular on variety and talk shows during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's  The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His onstage persona, that of an egotistical, narcissistic, nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s post-modern comedians, including Steve Martin, Martin Mull, and Andy Kaufman.\n\nAfter two successful comedy albums, Comedy Minus One (1973) and the Grammy Award–nominated A Star Is Bought (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker. He had already made his first short film, The Famous Comedians School, a satiric short and an early example of the mockumentary subgenre that appeared on the PBS show The Great American Dream Machine in 1972.Ramsey Ess, [http://splitsider.com/2013/01/the-short-films-of-albert-brooks/ The Short Films of Albert Brooks], January 4, 2013\n\nIn 1975, he directed six short films for the first season of NBC's Saturday Night Live:\n* October 11, 1975, episode (host: George Carlin): \"The Impossible Truth\"\n* October 18, 1975, episode (host: Paul Simon): failed Candid Camera stunts and home movies\n* October 25, 1975, episode (host: Rob Reiner): heart surgery\n* November 8, 1975, episode (host: Candice Bergen): upcoming season\n* December 13, 1975, episode (host: Richard Pryor): sick\n* January 9, 1976, episode (host: Elliott Gould): audience test screening\n\nIn 1976 he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in Martin Scorsese's landmark Taxi Driver; Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue. The role reflected Brooks's decision to move to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he'd had with Taxi Driver screenwriter Paul Schrader, in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not \"understand\" – a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.\n\nBrooks directed his first feature film, Real Life, in 1979. The film, in which Brooks (playing a version of himself) obnoxiously films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an Oscar and a Nobel Prize, was a sendup of PBS's An American Family documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of reality television.Montoya, Maria (February 28, 2009).

(He also got starring credits in the film, even though his character dies within roughly the first half-hour of the film.)\n\n1981–1999\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator Monica Johnson), directed and starred in a series of well-received comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include 1981's Modern Romance, where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend (Kathryn Harrold). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3 million domestically, but was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was \"not Brooks at his best, but still amusing\". His best-received film, Lost in America (1985), featured Brooks and Julie Hagerty as a couple who leave their yuppie lifestyle and drop out of society to live in a motor home as they have always dreamed of doing, meeting disappointment.\n\nBrooks's Defending Your Life (1991) placed his lead character in the afterlife, put on trial to justify his human fears and determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the chemistry between Brooks and Meryl Streep, as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for Mother (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother (Debbie Reynolds). 1999's The Muse featured Brooks as a Hollywood screenwriter who has \"lost his edge\" using the services of an authentic muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. In an interview with Brooks with regards to The Muse, Gavin Smith wrote, \"Brooks's distinctive film making style is remarkably discreet and unemphatic; he has a light, deft touch, with a classical precision and economy, shooting and cutting his scenes in smooth, seamless successions of medium shots, with clean, high-key lighting.\"Film Comment, Jan/Feb 1999, [http://www.filmcomment.com/article/all-the-choices-albert-brooks-interview All The Choices: Albert Brooks Interview]\n\nBrooks has appeared as a guest voice on The Simpsons five times during its run (always under the name A.
