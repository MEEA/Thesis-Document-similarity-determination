Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.\n\nConstruction and formula of the ternary set\n\nThe Cantor ternary set \\mathcal{C} is created by iteratively deleting the open middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third (, ) from the interval [0, 1], leaving two line segments: [0, ] ∪ [, 1].  Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0, ] ∪ [, ]  ∪ [, ] ∪ [, 1]. This process is continued ad infinitum, where the nth set is\n\nC_n \\frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \\cup \\left(\\frac 2 {3} +\\frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \\right) \\text{ for } n \\ge 1, \\text{ and } C_0\n[0,1].\n\nThe Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0, 1] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process:\n \\mathcal{C} :\\bigcap_{n\n1}^\\infty C_n.\n\nThe first six steps of this process are illustrated below.\n\nUsing the idea of self-similar transformations, T_L(x)x/3,   T_R(x)\n(2+x)/3 and  C_n =T_L(C_{n-1})\\cup T_R(C_{n-1}), the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set areMohsen Soltanifar, A Different Description of A Family of Middle-a Cantor Sets, American Journal of Undergraduate Research, Vol 5, No 2, pp 9–12, 2006\n\n \\mathcal{C}[0,1] \\smallsetminus \\bigcup_{n\n1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{n-1}-1} \\left(\\frac{3k+1}{3^n},\\frac{3k+2}{3^n}\\right),\nor\n \\mathcal{C}\\bigcap_{n\n1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{n-1}-1} \\left( \\left[\\frac{3k+0}{3^n},\\frac{3k+1}{3^n}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{3k+2}{3^n},\\frac{3k+3}{3^n}\\right] \\right). \n\nThis process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a finite subdivision rule.  The Cantor ternary set is an example of a fractal string.\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers on the unit interval that are expressible as a ternary (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the \"2\" digits in these fractions with \"1\" digits produces a bijective mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\nComposition \n\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., measure) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the geometric progression\n\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} \n \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\cdots  \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) \n 1.\n\nSo that the proportion left is  1 – 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left—after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (1/3, 2/3) from the original interval [0, 1] leaves behind the points 1/3  and 2/3. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that only the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number 1/4, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202…. It is in the bottom third, and the top ninth of that third, and the bottom twenty-seventh of that ninth, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.\nIn the sense of cardinality, most members of the Cantor set are not endpoints of deleted intervals. The construction steps, which are countable, each introduce a finite number of endpoints. Therefore the endpoints are also countable, while the whole Cantor set is not.\n\nProperties \n\nCardinality \n\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is uncountable. To see this, we show that there is a function f from the Cantor set \\mathcal{C} to the closed interval [0,1] that is surjective (i.e. f maps from \\mathcal{C} onto [0,1]) so that the cardinality of \\mathcal{C} is no less than that of [0,1].  Since \\mathcal{C} is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem.\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0, 1] interval in terms of base 3 (or ternary) notation. \nRecall that some points admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example 1/3, that can be written as 0.13 but also as 0.022222...3, and 2/3, that can be written as 0.23 but also as 0.12222...3.\n(This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any  positional system.)\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...3 where xxxxx...3 is strictly between 00000...3 and 22222...3.   So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\n* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...3 (including 0.022222...3 = 1/3)\n* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...3 (including 0.222222...3 = 1)\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the decimal point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\n\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...3 and 0.21xxxx...3, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first two digits is 1.  Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step n, it must have a ternary representation whose nth digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.  It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, 1/3 0.13 and 7/9 \n 0.213 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 0.2222...3, 1/3 \n 0.022222...3 and 7/9 = 0.2022222...3.  So while a number in \\mathcal{C} may have either a terminating or a recurring ternary numeral, one of its representations will consist entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nThe function from \\mathcal{C} to [0,1] is defined by taking the numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a binary representation of a real number.  In a formula,\n\nf \\bigg( \\sum_{k1}^\\infty a_k 3^{-k} \\bigg) \n \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}.\n\nFor any number y in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number x in \\mathcal{C} by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, f(x) y so that y is in the range of f.  For instance if y \n 3/5 0.100110011001...2, we write x \n 0.200220022002...3 7/10.  Consequently, f is surjective; however, f is not injective — interestingly enough, the values for which f(x) coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the middle thirds removed.  For instance, 7/9 \n 0.2022222...3 and 8/9 0.2200000...3 so f(7/9) \n 0.101111...2 0.112 \n f(8/9).\n\nSo there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in [0, 1], and the Cantor set is uncountable (see Cantor's diagonal argument). However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is ¼, which can be written as 0.02020202020...3 in ternary notation.  In fact, given any x\\in[-1,1], there exist a,b\\in\\mathcal{C} such that x a-b.  This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:y\nx+c\\}\\cap(\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}) \\neq\\emptyset for every c\\in[-1,1]. Since this construction provides an injection from [-1,1] to \\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}, we have |\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}|\\geq|[-1,1]|\\mathfrak{c} as an immediate corollary.  Assuming that |A\\times A|\n|A| for any infinite set A (a statement shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice by Tarski), this provides another demonstration that |\\mathcal{C}|=\\mathfrak{c}.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all algebraic irrational numbers are normal.  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or transcendental.\n\nSelf-similarity \n\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a fractal. It is self-similar, because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, there are two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations, T_L(x)x/3 and T_R(x)\n(2+x)/3, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to homeomorphism: T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cong T_R(\\mathcal{C})\\cong \\mathcal{C}.\n\nRepeated iteration of T_L and T_R can be visualized as an infinite binary tree. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set \\{T_L,T_R\\} together with function composition forms a monoid, the dyadic monoid.\n\nThe automorphisms of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the modular group. Thus, the Cantor set is a homogeneous space in the sense that for any two points x and y in the Cantor set \\mathcal{C}, there exists a homeomorphism h:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C} with h(x)=y. These homeomorphisms can be expressed explicitly, as Möbius transformations.   \n\nConservation law\n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the d_fth moment (where d_f=\\ln(2)/\\ln(3) is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set P.

Rodgers, Models of fragmentation and stochastic fractals Physics Letters A 208 95 (1995).\n. We know that there are N=2^n intervals of size 1/3^n\npresent in the system at the nth step of its construction. Then if we level the surviving intervals\nas x_1, x_2, ..., x_{2^n} then the d_fth moment is x_1^{d_f}+x_2^{d_f}\n+...+x_{2^n}^{d_f}1 since x_1\nx_2... \nx_{2^n}=1/3^n.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.631.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension theorem\n\nAn essential property of Cantor sets is giving sufficiency of fractals for any given Hausdorff dimension  r   :\n\nTheorem. For any given  r>0,   there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension  r    in n-dimensional Euclidean space  R^{n}, (n \\geq -[-r]).  Mohsen Soltanifar, On A Sequence of Cantor Fractals, Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal, Vol 7, No 1, paper 9, 2006\n\nTopological and analytical properties \n\nAlthough \"the\" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor described above, topologists often talk about \"a\" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to it.\n\nAs the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a union of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space. Since it is also totally bounded, the Heine–Borel theorem says that it must be compact.\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an accumulation point (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an interior point. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a perfect set in topology, while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is nowhere dense in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the complement of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ — one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the relative topology on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a clopen set.  Consequently, the Cantor set is totally disconnected.  As a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space, the Cantor set is an example of a Stone space.\n\nAs a topological space, the Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the space \\{0, 1\\}, where each copy carries the discrete topology. This is the space of all sequences in two digits \n2^\\mathbb{N}=\\{(x_n)\\mid x_n\\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\},\n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of 2-adic integers. The basis for the open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets; the homeomorphism maps these to the subspace topology that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the Cantor space as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via Tychonoff's theorem.\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the p-adic integers, and, if one point is removed from it, to the p-adic numbers.\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a metric space with respect to the ordinary distance metric; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the p-adic metric on 2^\\mathbb{N}: given two sequences (x_n),(y_n)\\in 2^\\mathbb{N}, the distance between them is d((x_n),(y_n)) = 1/k, where k is the smallest index such that x_k \\ne y_k; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same topology on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the category of compact metric spaces, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not universal in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in functional analysis, where it is sometimes known as the representation theorem for compact metric spaces.Stephen Willard, General Topology, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1968.\n\nFor any integer q ≥ 2, the topology on the group GZqω (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the Pontrjagin dual Γ is also Zqω, the topology of Γ is compact. One can see that Γ is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case q\n2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe geometric mean of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1889476/cantor-set-geometric-mean\n\nMeasure and probability\n\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the compact group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.[http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/  the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure]\n\nCantor numbers\n\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, thenFractals, Chaos, Power Laws, Manfred Schroeder, Dover, 1991, p.164-165.\n*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.\n*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.\n\nVariants \n\nSmith–Volterra–Cantor set\n\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle.  In the case where the middle 8/10 of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case—the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.\n\nBy removing progressively smaller percentages of the remaining pieces in every step, one can also construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure, while still being nowhere dense. See Smith–Volterra–Cantor set for an example.\n\nStochastic Cantor set\n\nNatural fractals do not appear in a blink of an eye rather through evolution in time accompanied by some randomness since nature likes to enjoy freedom of choice. One can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing\nrandomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals. In the case of stochastic triadic Cantor set the resulting process can be described by the following rate equationP. L. Krapivsky and E. Ben-Naim, Multiscaling in Stochastic Fractals Phys. Lett.

In either case, like triadic Cantor set, the d_fth moment (\\int x^{d_f}c(x,t)dx\nconstant)) of stochastic triadic and dyadic Cantor set too are conserved quantities.\n\nCantor dust \n\nCantor dust is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, making it a Cantor space. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has zero measure.\n\nA different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the Sierpinski carpet, where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. The 3D analogue of this is the Menger sponge.\n\nHistorical remarks\n\nCantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept.\n\nThis set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a trigonometric series might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an abstract, general theory of infinite sets.\n\nA column capital from the Ancient Egyptian site of the island of Philae carries a pattern which resembles the Cantor set.

This process is continued ad infinitum, where the nth set is\n\nC_n \\frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \\cup \\left(\\frac 2 {3} +\\frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \\right) \\text{ for } n \\ge 1, \\text{ and } C_0\n[0,1].\n\nThe Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0, 1] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process:\n \\mathcal{C} :\\bigcap_{n\n1}^\\infty C_n.\n\nThe first six steps of this process are illustrated below.\n\nUsing the idea of self-similar transformations, T_L(x)x/3,   T_R(x)\n(2+x)/3 and  C_n =T_L(C_{n-1})\\cup T_R(C_{n-1}), the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set areMohsen Soltanifar, A Different Description of A Family of Middle-a Cantor Sets, American Journal of Undergraduate Research, Vol 5, No 2, pp 9–12, 2006\n\n \\mathcal{C}[0,1] \\smallsetminus \\bigcup_{n\n1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{n-1}-1} \\left(\\frac{3k+1}{3^n},\\frac{3k+2}{3^n}\\right),\nor\n \\mathcal{C}\\bigcap_{n\n1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{n-1}-1} \\left( \\left[\\frac{3k+0}{3^n},\\frac{3k+1}{3^n}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{3k+2}{3^n},\\frac{3k+3}{3^n}\\right] \\right). \n\nThis process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a finite subdivision rule.  The Cantor ternary set is an example of a fractal string.\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers on the unit interval that are expressible as a ternary (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the \"2\" digits in these fractions with \"1\" digits produces a bijective mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\nComposition \n\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., measure) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the geometric progression\n\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} \n \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\cdots  \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) \n 1.\n\nSo that the proportion left is  1 – 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left—after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (1/3, 2/3) from the original interval [0, 1] leaves behind the points 1/3  and 2/3. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that only the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number 1/4, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202…. It is in the bottom third, and the top ninth of that third, and the bottom twenty-seventh of that ninth, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.\nIn the sense of cardinality, most members of the Cantor set are not endpoints of deleted intervals. The construction steps, which are countable, each introduce a finite number of endpoints. Therefore the endpoints are also countable, while the whole Cantor set is not.\n\nProperties \n\nCardinality \n\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is uncountable. To see this, we show that there is a function f from the Cantor set \\mathcal{C} to the closed interval [0,1] that is surjective (i.e. f maps from \\mathcal{C} onto [0,1]) so that the cardinality of \\mathcal{C} is no less than that of [0,1].  Since \\mathcal{C} is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem.\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0, 1] interval in terms of base 3 (or ternary) notation. \nRecall that some points admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example 1/3, that can be written as 0.13 but also as 0.022222...3, and 2/3, that can be written as 0.23 but also as 0.12222...3.\n(This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any  positional system.)\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...3 where xxxxx...3 is strictly between 00000...3 and 22222...3.   So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\n* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...3 (including 0.022222...3 = 1/3)\n* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...3 (including 0.222222...3 = 1)\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the decimal point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\n\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...3 and 0.21xxxx...3, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first two digits is 1.  Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step n, it must have a ternary representation whose nth digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.  It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, 1/3 0.13 and 7/9 \n 0.213 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 0.2222...3, 1/3 \n 0.022222...3 and 7/9 = 0.2022222...3.  So while a number in \\mathcal{C} may have either a terminating or a recurring ternary numeral, one of its representations will consist entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nThe function from \\mathcal{C} to [0,1] is defined by taking the numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a binary representation of a real number.  In a formula,\n\nf \\bigg( \\sum_{k1}^\\infty a_k 3^{-k} \\bigg) \n \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}.\n\nFor any number y in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number x in \\mathcal{C} by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, f(x) y so that y is in the range of f.  For instance if y \n 3/5 0.100110011001...2, we write x \n 0.200220022002...3 7/10.  Consequently, f is surjective; however, f is not injective — interestingly enough, the values for which f(x) coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the middle thirds removed.  For instance, 7/9 \n 0.2022222...3 and 8/9 0.2200000...3 so f(7/9) \n 0.101111...2 0.112 \n f(8/9).\n\nSo there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in [0, 1], and the Cantor set is uncountable (see Cantor's diagonal argument). However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is ¼, which can be written as 0.02020202020...3 in ternary notation.  In fact, given any x\\in[-1,1], there exist a,b\\in\\mathcal{C} such that x a-b.  This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:y\nx+c\\}\\cap(\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}) \\neq\\emptyset for every c\\in[-1,1]. Since this construction provides an injection from [-1,1] to \\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}, we have |\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}|\\geq|[-1,1]|\\mathfrak{c} as an immediate corollary.  Assuming that |A\\times A|\n|A| for any infinite set A (a statement shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice by Tarski), this provides another demonstration that |\\mathcal{C}|=\\mathfrak{c}.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all algebraic irrational numbers are normal.  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or transcendental.\n\nSelf-similarity \n\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a fractal. It is self-similar, because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, there are two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations, T_L(x)x/3 and T_R(x)\n(2+x)/3, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to homeomorphism: T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cong T_R(\\mathcal{C})\\cong \\mathcal{C}.\n\nRepeated iteration of T_L and T_R can be visualized as an infinite binary tree. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set \\{T_L,T_R\\} together with function composition forms a monoid, the dyadic monoid.\n\nThe automorphisms of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the modular group. Thus, the Cantor set is a homogeneous space in the sense that for any two points x and y in the Cantor set \\mathcal{C}, there exists a homeomorphism h:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C} with h(x)=y. These homeomorphisms can be expressed explicitly, as Möbius transformations.   \n\nConservation law\n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the d_fth moment (where d_f=\\ln(2)/\\ln(3) is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set P.

We know that there are N=2^n intervals of size 1/3^n\npresent in the system at the nth step of its construction. Then if we level the surviving intervals\nas x_1, x_2, ..., x_{2^n} then the d_fth moment is x_1^{d_f}+x_2^{d_f}\n+...+x_{2^n}^{d_f}1 since x_1\nx_2... \nx_{2^n}=1/3^n.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.631.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension theorem\n\nAn essential property of Cantor sets is giving sufficiency of fractals for any given Hausdorff dimension  r   :\n\nTheorem. For any given  r>0,   there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension  r    in n-dimensional Euclidean space  R^{n}, (n \\geq -[-r]).  Mohsen Soltanifar, On A Sequence of Cantor Fractals, Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal, Vol 7, No 1, paper 9, 2006\n\nTopological and analytical properties \n\nAlthough \"the\" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor described above, topologists often talk about \"a\" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to it.\n\nAs the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a union of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space. Since it is also totally bounded, the Heine–Borel theorem says that it must be compact.\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an accumulation point (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an interior point. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a perfect set in topology, while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is nowhere dense in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the complement of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ — one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the relative topology on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a clopen set.  Consequently, the Cantor set is totally disconnected.  As a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space, the Cantor set is an example of a Stone space.\n\nAs a topological space, the Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the space \\{0, 1\\}, where each copy carries the discrete topology. This is the space of all sequences in two digits \n2^\\mathbb{N}=\\{(x_n)\\mid x_n\\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\},\n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of 2-adic integers. The basis for the open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets; the homeomorphism maps these to the subspace topology that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the Cantor space as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via Tychonoff's theorem.\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the p-adic integers, and, if one point is removed from it, to the p-adic numbers.\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a metric space with respect to the ordinary distance metric; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the p-adic metric on 2^\\mathbb{N}: given two sequences (x_n),(y_n)\\in 2^\\mathbb{N}, the distance between them is d((x_n),(y_n)) = 1/k, where k is the smallest index such that x_k \\ne y_k; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same topology on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the category of compact metric spaces, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not universal in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in functional analysis, where it is sometimes known as the representation theorem for compact metric spaces.Stephen Willard, General Topology, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1968.\n\nFor any integer q ≥ 2, the topology on the group GZqω (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the Pontrjagin dual Γ is also Zqω, the topology of Γ is compact. One can see that Γ is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case q\n2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe geometric mean of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1889476/cantor-set-geometric-mean\n\nMeasure and probability\n\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the compact group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.[http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/  the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure]\n\nCantor numbers\n\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, thenFractals, Chaos, Power Laws, Manfred Schroeder, Dover, 1991, p.164-165.\n*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.\n*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.\n\nVariants \n\nSmith–Volterra–Cantor set\n\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle.  In the case where the middle 8/10 of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case—the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.\n\nBy removing progressively smaller percentages of the remaining pieces in every step, one can also construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure, while still being nowhere dense. See Smith–Volterra–Cantor set for an example.\n\nStochastic Cantor set\n\nNatural fractals do not appear in a blink of an eye rather through evolution in time accompanied by some randomness since nature likes to enjoy freedom of choice. One can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing\nrandomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals. In the case of stochastic triadic Cantor set the resulting process can be described by the following rate equationP. L. Krapivsky and E. Ben-Naim, Multiscaling in Stochastic Fractals Phys. Lett.

In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set the solution for c(x,t) exhibits dynamic scaling as its solution in the long-time limit is t^{-(1+d_f)}e^{-xt} where the fractal dimension of the stochastic dyadic Cantor set d_fp. In either case, like triadic Cantor set, the d_fth moment (\\int x^{d_f}c(x,t)dx\nconstant)) of stochastic triadic and dyadic Cantor set too are conserved quantities.\n\nCantor dust \n\nCantor dust is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, making it a Cantor space. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has zero measure.\n\nA different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the Sierpinski carpet, where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. The 3D analogue of this is the Menger sponge.\n\nHistorical remarks\n\nCantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept.\n\nThis set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a trigonometric series might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an abstract, general theory of infinite sets.\n\nA column capital from the Ancient Egyptian site of the island of Philae carries a pattern which resembles the Cantor set. Cantor may have seen the image, as his cousin was an Egyptologist. Cantor set. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=6172."
