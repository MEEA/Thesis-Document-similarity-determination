  "textBody" : "Michael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960 – 22 November 1997) was an Australian musician and actor. He was a founding member, lead singer and lyricist of rock band INXS from 1977 until his death in November 1997. He was a member of the short-lived pop rock group Max Q and recorded solo material which was released posthumously. He acted in feature films, including Dogs in Space (1986), Frankenstein Unbound (1990), and Limp (1997). According to rock-music historian Ian McFarlane, \"Hutchence was the archetypal rock showman. He exuded an overtly sexual, macho cool with his flowing locks, and lithe and exuberant stage movements.\" Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the 1991 BRIT Awards, with INXS winning the related group award.\n\nHis private life was often reported in the Australian and international press, with a string of love affairs with prominent actresses, models and singers. Hutchence's relationship with UK television presenter Paula Yates began while she was married to musician and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Geldof and Yates divorced in 1996.  During July of the same year, Hutchence and Yates had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.\n\nOn the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in his hotel room in Sydney. His death was reported by the New South Wales Coroner to be the result of suicide. \n\nEarly life and education\n\nMichael Kelland John Hutchence was born on 22 January 1960, the son of Sydney businessman Kelland (\"Kell\") Hutchence, and make-up artist, Patricia (née Kennedy). Hutchence was of Irish ancestry from his mother's side, Patricia's father was from County Cork in Ireland. Following Kell's business interests, the Hutchence family moved to Brisbane where younger brother Rhett was born, and subsequently relocated to Hong Kong as a result of their father taking a job at an Australian trading company. During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended Beacon Hill School in Kowloon Tong. While in Hong Kong, Michael showed a lot of promise in a possible swimming career before breaking his arm badly. He then began to show interest in poetry and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial, before attending King George V School during his early teens.\n\nThe family returned to Sydney in 1972, buying a house in Belrose near the Northern Beaches when Michael was 12 years old. Michael attended Davidson High School, where he met Andrew Farriss and they became good friends. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss spent a lot of time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside two classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. From nearby Forest High School, bass guitarist Garry Beers and Geoff Kennelly on drums filled out the line-up. The boys transferred to Davidson High School where they became serious about the idea of starting a proper band. Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; in 1976 for a short time, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in California. Hutchence later returned to Sydney with his mother.\n\nIn 1977, a new band, The Farriss Brothers, was formed with Tim Farriss on lead guitar, his younger brother Andrew as keyboardist, and youngest brother Jon on drums. Andrew brought Hutchence on board as lead vocalist and Beers on bass guitar, and Tim brought his former bandmate Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at Whale Beach, 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney.\n\nIn 1978, the parents of the Farriss boys moved to Perth, Western Australia, taking Jon, who was still at high school. After Hutchence and Andrew finished their secondary schooling, the rest of the group followed.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\n\nHutchence, the Farriss brothers, Kerny, Sanders, Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing \"We Are the Vegetables\". Ten months later, they returned to Sydney, where they recorded a set of demos. The Farriss Brothers regularly supported hard rockers Midnight Oil on the pub rock circuit, and were renamed as INXS in 1979. Their first performance under the new name was on 1 September at the Oceanview Hotel in Toukley. In May 1980, the group released their first single, \"Simple Simon\"/\"We Are the Vegetables\" which was followed by the debut album, INXS, in October. Their first Top 40 Australian hit on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart, \"Just Keep Walking\", was released in September. During the 1980s, Hutchence resided at the apartment block at the end of Kirketon Road, Darlinghurst, Sydney.\n\nHutchence became the main spokesperson for the band. He co-wrote almost all of INXS's songs with Andrew Farriss, who has attributed his own success as a songwriter to Hutchence's \"genius\".\n\nAccording to Hutchence, \"Most of the songs on Underneath the Colours were written in a relatively short space of time. Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents\". Soon after recording sessions for Underneath the Colours – produced by Richard Clapton – had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded \"Speed Kills\", written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the Freedom (1982) film soundtrack, directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982.\n\nStardom and acting career\n\nIn March 1985, after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album The Swing (1984), WEA released the Australian version of Dekadance, as a limited edition cassette only EP of six tracks including remixes from the album. The cassette also included a cover version of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's hit \"Jackson\", which Hutchence sang as a duet with Jenny Morris, a backing singer for The Swing sessions. The EP reached No 2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Hutchence provided vocals for new wave band Beargarden's 1985 single release.\n\nOn 19 May, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 Countdown Music and Video Awards ceremony, including 'Best Songwriter' for Hutchence and Andrew, and 'Most Popular Male' for Hutchence. They performed \"Burn for You\", dressed in Akubras (a brand of hats) and Drizabones (a brand of outdoor coats/oilskin jackets) followed by Hutchence and Morris singing \"Jackson\" to close. INXS performed five songs for the July Oz for Africa concert, in conjunction with the Live Aid benefit organised by Irish musician, Bob Geldof. Two of their songs, \"What You Need\" and \"Don't Change\", were also in the BBC broadcast and are contained on Live Aid's four DVD boxed set released in 2004.\n\nIn 1986, Hutchence played Sam, the lead male role, in the Australian film Dogs in Space, directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein. Sam's girlfriend, Anna, was portrayed by Saskia Post as a \"fragile peroxide blonde in op-shop clothes\". Some events in the film are based on Lowenstein's life when sharing a home in a Melbourne inner suburb with friend Sam Sejavka (Beargarden) when Sam was in the band The Ears,[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490031/ We're Livin' on Dog Food (2009)], documentary by Ghost Pictures in the late 1970s. Hutchence provided four songs on the film's soundtrack.  A cover version of \"Rooms for the Memory\", a song by Whirlywirld (a post-punk band that included Ollie Olsen), was released as a solo single. It peaked at No. 11 in February 1987. Back in 1979, both INXS and Whirlywirld had played at the Crystal Ballroom, in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, which featured in the film. \n\nLate in 1986, before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break, the band's management decided to stage the Australian Made tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country. The roster featured INXS, Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel), Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, The Triffids and I'm Talking. To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on The Easybeats cover \"Good Times\" and \"Laying Down the Law\", which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. \"Good Times\" was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the U.S. on 1 August 1987. Divinyls' lead singer Chrissie Amphlett enjoyed the tour and reconnected with Hutchence, stating that \"[he] was a sweet man, who said in one interview that he wanted me to have his baby.\"\n\nIn 1987, Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton's album Glory Road, which was produced by Jon Farriss.\n\nINXS released Kick in October 1987, and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity. Kick peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 U.S. singles, \"New Sensation\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Devil Inside\" and No. 1 \"Need You Tonight\". \"Need You Tonight\" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. According to 1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them, Need You Tonight is not lyrically complex; it is Hutchence's performance where \"he sings in kittenish whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night\" that makes the song \"as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been\". INXS toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track \"Mediate\" (which played after the video for \"Need You Tonight\") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\" winning in five categories.\n\nIn 1989, Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the Max Q project, and was joined by members of Olsen's previous groups including Whirlywirld, No and Orchestra of Skin and Bone. They released a self-titled album and three singles, \"Way of the World\", \"Sometimes\" and \"Monday Night by Satellite\". Max Q disbanded in 1990. Max Q showed Hutchence exploring the darker side of his music and, with Olsen, he created \"one of the most innovative dance music albums of the decade\". Hutchence wrote most of the music and provided \"an extraordinary performance ... it was one of the most significant statements Hutchence was to make\". In 1990, Hutchence portrayed nineteenth-century Romantic poet Percy Shelley in Roger Corman's film version of Frankenstein Unbound, which was based on a science fiction time travel story of the same name written by Brian Aldiss.\n\nIn 1990, INXS released X, which spawned more international hits such as \"Suicide Blonde\" and \"Disappear\" (both Top 10 in the US). \"Suicide Blonde\" peaked at No. 2 in Australia and No. 11 in the UK. Hutchence, with Andrew Farriss, wrote the song after Hutchence's then-girlfriend, Kylie Minogue, used the phrase \"suicide blonde\" to describe her look during  her 1989 film, The Delinquents; the film depicted Minogue in a platinum blonde wig. Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the 1991 BRIT Awards with INXS winning the related group award. Hutchence provided vocals for pub rockers Noiseworks' album, Love Versus Money (1991).\n\nWelcome to Wherever You Are was released in August 1992, but INXS did not tour to support the album. It received good critical reviews and went to No. 1 in the UK and in Sweden, No. 2 in Australia and Switzerland, and No. 3 in Norway, but had less chart success in the U.S.; there, it peaked at No. 16.\n\nLater career\n\nHutchence and INXS faced reduced commercial success with Full Moon, Dirty Hearts, especially in the U.S. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through his romances. He commenced work on a self-titled solo album in the mid-1990s. \n\nAfter a period of inactivity and releases that received lukewarm reviews, INXS recorded the band's 10th official album, Elegantly Wasted, in 1996, produced by Bruce Fairbairn and Andrew Farriss.\n\nArtistry\n\nIn 2013, News.com.au ranked Hutchence fourth in a list of the 15 greatest Australian singers of all time. Billboard has described Hutchence as \"charismatic,\" with a \"seductive purr and [a] lithe, magnetic stage presence.\" Paul Donoughue of ABC.net.au has written that Hutchence had \"a phenomenal voice — moody, sexual, and dynamic, able to shift effortlessly from fragile to cocksure.\" Reviewing an INXS concert, Dave Simpson of The Guardian wrote, \"Watching Hutchence, hair flailing, crotch thrusting, a mischievous smile forever creeping across his leathery face, I realised that here was a man born to be onstage, living and loving every minute, an explosion of sexual energy. Hutchence biographer Toby Creswell has written that \"Hutchence was, without question, one of the truly great frontmen — he expressed the music in a dynamic way that few others could.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nAccording to People, Hutchence's “public brawls and onetime open drug use led London [tabloids] to dub him the ‘wild man of rock.’”http://people.com/archive/inx-plicable-vol-48-no-23/\n\nHutchence was romantically linked to Kylie Minogue, Belinda Carlisle,http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/carlisle-opens-up-about-hutchence/news-story/9b5053f804807ab6709f6ac676b74e06 Helena Christensen, and Kym Wilson.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/kym-wilson-on-the-death-of-michael-hutchence-and-the-turning-point-in-my-life/news-story/25f1d831a7b14aa0ca91ef8be2dbb566\n\nIn August 1992, Helena Christensen and Hutchence were walking after drinking heavily when he refused to move for a taxi. The taxi driver then assaulted him, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the roadway. Hutchence suffered a fractured skull in the altercation. Hutchence did not immediately seek medical assistance for the injury, instead waiting several days before seeing a doctor. As a result, Hutchence's fractured skull left him with an almost complete loss of the sense of smell and significant loss of taste. This led to periods of depression and increased levels of aggression; he had not fully recovered after two weeks in a Copenhagen hospital. According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence pulled a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of Full Moon, Dirty Hearts on the isle of Capri. \"Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band. Suicide blonde, right?\"\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hutchence became romantically involved with Paula Yates. He had met Yates in 1985, during an interview for her program, The Tube. Yates interviewed Hutchence again in 1994 for her Big Breakfast show, and their affair was soon uncovered by the British press. At the time, Yates was married to The Boomtown Rats' lead singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Media scrutiny was intense, and Hutchence assaulted a photographer who had followed the couple. Yates' separation from Geldof in February 1995 sparked a public and at times bitter custody battle over their daughters. Yates and Geldof divorced in May 1996. \n\nOn 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to Hutchence's only child, their daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, who Yates claimed was delivered in their bathroom. Like her half-sisters, she was christened with an unusual name. Pixie chose Heavenly, Hutchence picked Hiraani, and Yates provided Tiger Lily; she was called Tiger and Hutchence described her as \"just what we ordered\". \n\nIn September 1996, Yates and Hutchence made headlines again when they were arrested for suspicion of drug possession after the family nanny reportedly found a small amount of opium in a shoebox under their bed. The case was later dropped for lack of evidence.\n\nDeath\n\nHutchence and INXS went on a world tour to support the April 1997 release of Elegantly Wasted. The final leg of their 20th anniversary tour was to occur in Australia in November and December. During the tour, Yates planned to visit Hutchence with his daughter and Yates's three children, but Geldof had taken legal action to prevent the visit. On the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence, aged 37, was found dead in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay, Sydney.\n\nGeldof and Yates each gave police statements on the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence on the morning of his death; however, they did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of Tiger's custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not bring her to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence \"was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby... [he] was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'\". Yates indicated that Hutchence said he was going to phone Geldof \"to let Tiger come to Australia\". Geldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence, who was \"hectoring and abusive and threatening\" during their phone conversation. The occupant in the room next to Hutchence's heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5 AM; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.\n\nHutchence's former girlfriend Kym Wilson and her then-boyfriend, Andrew Reyment, were the last people to see Hutchence alive; when they left him at 4:50 AM on the day of his death, he was still awaiting a phone call from Yates. Hutchence's second-to-last outgoing phone call was made to his personal manager, Martha Troup; in a voice-mail message, he said, \"Marth, Michael here. I've fucking had enough.\" When Troup returned the call, there was no answer. At 9:54 AM, Hutchence spoke with a former longtime girlfriend, Michèle Bennett, who stated that he was crying, sounded upset, and told her he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his door at about 10:40 AM, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50 AM. Police reported that Hutchence was found \"in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snake skin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure at the top of the door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken.\"\n\nOn 6 February 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report. The report ruled that Hutchence's death was a suicide while depressed and under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. \"An analysis report of Hutchence's blood [indicated] the presence of alcohol, cocaine, Prozac and prescription drugs.\" In a 1999 interview on 60 Minutes (and in a documentary film on Channel 4), Yates claimed that Hutchence's death may have resulted from autoerotic asphyxiation; this claim contradicted her previous statements to police investigators and the coroner. In producing his coroner's report, Hand had specifically considered the suggestions of accidental death (coupled with the fact that Hutchence left no suicide note), but had discounted them based on substantial evidence presented to the contrary. Despite the official coroner's report, fans and relatives considered his death accidental. In 2000, Patricia Glassop (Hutchence's mother, who had remarried) and Tina Schorr (his sister), gave an interview on This Morning, asserting that Yates had on more than one occasion threatened to harm herself or Tiger if Hutchence did not marry her; they believed that Yates had made similar statements to Hutchence on the morning of his death, directly precipitating his suicide.\n\nOn 27 November, Hutchence's funeral was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. His casket was carried out of the cathedral by members of INXS and by his younger brother, Rhett; \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. Nick Cave, a friend of Hutchence, performed his 1997 song \"Into My Arms\" during the funeral and requested that television cameras be switched off. Rhett claimed in his 2004 book, Total XS, that on the previous day at the funeral parlour, Yates had put a gram of heroin into Hutchence's pocket. He was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney,[http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page\ncem&FScemeteryid=639480 find-a-grave]; Retrieved 7 August 2013 and his ashes were scattered on Sydney Harbour in Rose Bay on 22 January 1998.\n\nLater developments\n\nINXS decided to continue without Hutchence, replacing him in November 1998 with Jimmy Barnes, then in June 1999 with Terence Trent D'Arby. Jon Stevens covered vocals during 2000–2002, but in 2005, INXS took their search for a lead singer to Rock Star: INXS, a reality TV show on CBS. The winner was Canadian singer J.D. Fortune.\n\nHutchence's solo album, Michael Hutchence, was finally released in October 1999. He had started on the album in 1995, recording songs in between INXS sessions and had last worked on it three days prior to his death. The last song he recorded was \"Possibilities\". The album was co-written and co-produced by Hutchence and various collaborators – Andy Gill (Gang of Four), Bernard Fowler (The Rolling Stones backing singer), Tim Simenon (Bomb the Bass), and Danny Saber (Black Grape). It has a duet with U2's Bono, \"Slide Away\", with Bono's vocals recorded after Hutchence's death. \n\nThe 1999 movie, Limp includes a cameo by Hutchence, playing a record company A&R man; he had filmed his scene in 1996 on a day off from working on INXS's Elegantly Wasted.\n\nOn 18 June 2000, Patricia Glassop and Tina Schorr released their book, Just a Man: The Real Michael Hutchence, which has been described as \"an odd biography ... [that] combines the basic facts of Hutchence's early life ... with an almost too-intimate view of the authors' feelings\". \n\nPaula Yates died on 17 September of an accidental heroin overdose; she was discovered by four-year-old Tiger. Geldof filed for custody of Tiger the next day. Although Geldof was not biologically related to Tiger, he wanted her to be raised with her half-sisters. Hutchence's family members were not given Geldof's permission to join the custody hearings; Patricia and Tina initiated legal proceedings to pursue custody. Geldof legally adopted Tiger, against the wishes of Patricia and Tina, who disagreed with Geldof changing her surname to Hutchence-Geldof. \n\nOn 12 December 2002, Hutchence's father, Kelland, died of cancer in Sydney. Kelland had helped create and maintain a memorial website for his son from 1999.\n\nOn 20 August 2005, Melbourne's The Age reported on the disposition of Hutchence's estate and assets, estimated at between $10 to $20 million but containing virtually nothing. The remainder of his estate had been sold off and swallowed in legal fees..\n\nPatricia Glassop died on 21 September 2010. In July 2009, Patricia had protested that Geldof had prevented access to her granddaughter for three years, \"It's totally cruel and unnecessary. I've lost my husband and now I have a granddaughter who doesn't even know her beloved Grandpa Ross [Glassop] has died. We have been completely cut out of her life by Bob Geldof.\"  Tiger was not in attendance at her grandmother's funeral due to Geldof's fear of the attention that would be generated. Her uncle Rhett indicated that Geldof had sent condolences, that he had spoken to Tiger and agreed it was advisable to keep the 14-year-old out of the media.\n\nDiscography \n\nSolo \n\n;Albums\n* Michael Hutchence (1999)\n\n;Singles\n* \"Speed Kills\" (1981)\n* \"Rooms for the Memory\" (1986)\n* \"A Strait Line\" (1999)\n\nWith Max Q\n\n* Max Q (1989), (see Max Q)\n\nWith INXS\n\nCollaborations and soundtracks \n\n* Freedom Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1982) – \"Speed Kills\", \"Forest Theme\" (with Don Walker of Cold Chisel)\n* Flame Fortune (1985) – \"Sex Symbol\", \"Jungle Boy\"\n*  Dogs in Space Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1987) – \"Dogs in Space\", \"Golf Course\", \"The Green Dragon\", \"Rooms for the Memory\"\n* Symphonic Music of the Rolling Stones (1994) – \"Under My Thumb\"\n* It's Now or Never: The Tribute The Elvis (1994) – \"Baby Let's Play House\"\n* Batman Forever Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1995) – \"The Passenger\"\n* Barb Wire Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1996) – \"Spill the Wine\"\n* One Voice: The Songs of Chage & Aska (1996) – \"Red Hill\"\n* No Talking, Just Head (1996) – \"The King Is Gone\" (The Heads with Michael Hutchence)\n\nTributes and dedications \n\n* Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, a friend of Hutchence and Yates, and Geldof's best man, wrote \"Michael\". It was recorded in 1996 and released on Medazzaland a month before Hutchence's death. Its lyrics include:\n:\"Trust you to get caught up in somebody's war; you'll come out of it all intact, I'm sure.\n:Just remember what friends were put here for;\n:Michael, you've got a lot to answer for, and I know that you're gonna call ... if you need me.\"\nDuran Duran was touring to support the album when Hutchence died and Le Bon found the song too difficult to perform at Lakewood Civic Auditorium, Lakewood (Cleveland), Ohio, United States. Le Bon was in tears through part of this show and the song was cut from the set list for the remainder of the tour. During subsequent tours it was reincluded, with Le Bon introducing the song by saying that he wanted to remember Hutchence for the way he lived instead of the way he died.\n* Nick Cave sang \"Into My Arms\" at the funeral on 27 November 1997, which was broadcast live on Australian TV. Out of respect, Cave requested the song not be televised.\n* Kylie Minogue recorded a tribute song to Hutchence for her 2000 album Light Years titled \"Bittersweet Goodbye\" and later covered \"Need You Tonight\" on her 2014 Kiss Me Once world tour. \n* Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins wrote \"Shame\" on their 1998 album Adore.\n* Powderfinger's \"Private Man\" on their 1998 album Internationalist.\n* The Church's \"This is It\" on their 1998 album Hologram of Baal.\n* Terri Nunn of Berlin and Corgan collaborated on \"Sacred and Profane\" for Berlin's 2000 album Live: Sacred & Profane. Nunn said, \"He was a very big inspiration for both Billy and me. The song is about my first experience seeing him because that changed my life. He influenced me probably more than anyone else as a performer. I became 12 years old in five minutes wanting to have sex with him. That's all I wanted! Oh my God. Everybody did! You just wanted him. He was the epitome of rock star.\"\n* U2 and Bono have made several tributes:\n** Bono, a close friend of Hutchence, wrote \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" on the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which he tries to convince Hutchence of its foolishness. Bono characterised it as a good old row between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence in real life. In a 2005 interview, Bono regretted that he had not spent more time with Hutchence. Bono's wife, Alison Hewson, had seen Hutchence prior to his death and noted \"he looked a bit shaky to [her].\"\n** Bono dedicated \"One\" to Hutchence on the live video PopMart: Live from Mexico City. During the intro he refers to Hutchence as \"a great mate, a great singer\".\n** On both PopMart and Elevation Tours, Bono dedicated \"Gone\"  to Hutchence by yelling \"Hutch!\" at its beginning.\n** On U2's Vertigo Tour, on 13 November 2006 in Sydney, Bono said \"Blow a kiss to Heaven to Michael Hutchence\" before playing \"With or Without You\".\n** On 24 November 2007, U2 played a secret gig at the Little Noise Sessions in Islington, London. During their performance of \"Desire\", Bono changed the lyrics of a verse to include a line from INXS' \"Need You Tonight\", \"I've got to let you know / You're one of my kind.\"\n* INXS dedicated many performances to Hutchence, including:\n** \"Never Tear Us Apart\", which was dedicated to Hutchence when performed on the 2002 Just For Kicks tour. During performances of the song, a screen showed pictures of Hutchence throughout his life.\n** \"God's Top Ten\", from the band's 2005 Switch album, is dedicated to Hutchence and his daughter, Tiger\n** \"Afterglow\", also from the band's Switch album, is dedicated to Hutchence alone.\n* At a 2007 show in Adelaide supporting INXS, Simple Minds's vocalist Jim Kerr dedicated \"Gloria\" to Hutchence, saying \"it's about a woman, but it'd have to be with Michael\". At a New Zealand show two months later, he rededicated \"Gloria\".\n* Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed \"Don't Change\" during their High Hopes Tour on the show of 19 February 2014 in Sydney, Australia, and played it for the first time in the United States in Albany, New York, on 13 May 2014.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Michael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960 – 22 November 1997) was an Australian musician and actor. He was a founding member, lead singer and lyricist of rock band INXS from 1977 until his death in November 1997. He was a member of the short-lived pop rock group Max Q and recorded solo material which was released posthumously. He acted in feature films, including Dogs in Space (1986), Frankenstein Unbound (1990), and Limp (1997). According to rock-music historian Ian McFarlane, \"Hutchence was the archetypal rock showman. He exuded an overtly sexual, macho cool with his flowing locks, and lithe and exuberant stage movements.\" Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the 1991 BRIT Awards, with INXS winning the related group award.\n\nHis private life was often reported in the Australian and international press, with a string of love affairs with prominent actresses, models and singers. Hutchence's relationship with UK television presenter Paula Yates began while she was married to musician and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Geldof and Yates divorced in 1996.  During July of the same year, Hutchence and Yates had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.\n\nOn the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in his hotel room in Sydney. His death was reported by the New South Wales Coroner to be the result of suicide. \n\nEarly life and education\n\nMichael Kelland John Hutchence was born on 22 January 1960, the son of Sydney businessman Kelland (\"Kell\") Hutchence, and make-up artist, Patricia (née Kennedy). Hutchence was of Irish ancestry from his mother's side, Patricia's father was from County Cork in Ireland. Following Kell's business interests, the Hutchence family moved to Brisbane where younger brother Rhett was born, and subsequently relocated to Hong Kong as a result of their father taking a job at an Australian trading company. During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended Beacon Hill School in Kowloon Tong. While in Hong Kong, Michael showed a lot of promise in a possible swimming career before breaking his arm badly. He then began to show interest in poetry and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial, before attending King George V School during his early teens.\n\nThe family returned to Sydney in 1972, buying a house in Belrose near the Northern Beaches when Michael was 12 years old. Michael attended Davidson High School, where he met Andrew Farriss and they became good friends. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss spent a lot of time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside two classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. From nearby Forest High School, bass guitarist Garry Beers and Geoff Kennelly on drums filled out the line-up. The boys transferred to Davidson High School where they became serious about the idea of starting a proper band. Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; in 1976 for a short time, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in California. Hutchence later returned to Sydney with his mother.\n\nIn 1977, a new band, The Farriss Brothers, was formed with Tim Farriss on lead guitar, his younger brother Andrew as keyboardist, and youngest brother Jon on drums. Andrew brought Hutchence on board as lead vocalist and Beers on bass guitar, and Tim brought his former bandmate Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at Whale Beach, 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney.\n\nIn 1978, the parents of the Farriss boys moved to Perth, Western Australia, taking Jon, who was still at high school. After Hutchence and Andrew finished their secondary schooling, the rest of the group followed.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\n\nHutchence, the Farriss brothers, Kerny, Sanders, Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing \"We Are the Vegetables\". Ten months later, they returned to Sydney, where they recorded a set of demos. The Farriss Brothers regularly supported hard rockers Midnight Oil on the pub rock circuit, and were renamed as INXS in 1979. Their first performance under the new name was on 1 September at the Oceanview Hotel in Toukley. In May 1980, the group released their first single, \"Simple Simon\"/\"We Are the Vegetables\" which was followed by the debut album, INXS, in October. Their first Top 40 Australian hit on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart, \"Just Keep Walking\", was released in September. During the 1980s, Hutchence resided at the apartment block at the end of Kirketon Road, Darlinghurst, Sydney.\n\nHutchence became the main spokesperson for the band. He co-wrote almost all of INXS's songs with Andrew Farriss, who has attributed his own success as a songwriter to Hutchence's \"genius\".\n\nAccording to Hutchence, \"Most of the songs on Underneath the Colours were written in a relatively short space of time. Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents\". Soon after recording sessions for Underneath the Colours – produced by Richard Clapton – had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded \"Speed Kills\", written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the Freedom (1982) film soundtrack, directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982.\n\nStardom and acting career\n\nIn March 1985, after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album The Swing (1984), WEA released the Australian version of Dekadance, as a limited edition cassette only EP of six tracks including remixes from the album. The cassette also included a cover version of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's hit \"Jackson\", which Hutchence sang as a duet with Jenny Morris, a backing singer for The Swing sessions. The EP reached No 2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Hutchence provided vocals for new wave band Beargarden's 1985 single release.\n\nOn 19 May, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 Countdown Music and Video Awards ceremony, including 'Best Songwriter' for Hutchence and Andrew, and 'Most Popular Male' for Hutchence. They performed \"Burn for You\", dressed in Akubras (a brand of hats) and Drizabones (a brand of outdoor coats/oilskin jackets) followed by Hutchence and Morris singing \"Jackson\" to close. INXS performed five songs for the July Oz for Africa concert, in conjunction with the Live Aid benefit organised by Irish musician, Bob Geldof. Two of their songs, \"What You Need\" and \"Don't Change\", were also in the BBC broadcast and are contained on Live Aid's four DVD boxed set released in 2004.\n\nIn 1986, Hutchence played Sam, the lead male role, in the Australian film Dogs in Space, directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein. Sam's girlfriend, Anna, was portrayed by Saskia Post as a \"fragile peroxide blonde in op-shop clothes\". Some events in the film are based on Lowenstein's life when sharing a home in a Melbourne inner suburb with friend Sam Sejavka (Beargarden) when Sam was in the band The Ears,[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490031/ We're Livin' on Dog Food (2009)], documentary by Ghost Pictures in the late 1970s. Hutchence provided four songs on the film's soundtrack.  A cover version of \"Rooms for the Memory\", a song by Whirlywirld (a post-punk band that included Ollie Olsen), was released as a solo single. It peaked at No. 11 in February 1987. Back in 1979, both INXS and Whirlywirld had played at the Crystal Ballroom, in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, which featured in the film. \n\nLate in 1986, before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break, the band's management decided to stage the Australian Made tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country. The roster featured INXS, Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel), Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, The Triffids and I'm Talking. To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on The Easybeats cover \"Good Times\" and \"Laying Down the Law\", which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. \"Good Times\" was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the U.S. on 1 August 1987. Divinyls' lead singer Chrissie Amphlett enjoyed the tour and reconnected with Hutchence, stating that \"[he] was a sweet man, who said in one interview that he wanted me to have his baby.\"\n\nIn 1987, Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton's album Glory Road, which was produced by Jon Farriss.\n\nINXS released Kick in October 1987, and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity. Kick peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 U.S. singles, \"New Sensation\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Devil Inside\" and No. 1 \"Need You Tonight\". \"Need You Tonight\" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. According to 1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them, Need You Tonight is not lyrically complex; it is Hutchence's performance where \"he sings in kittenish whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night\" that makes the song \"as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been\". INXS toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track \"Mediate\" (which played after the video for \"Need You Tonight\") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\" winning in five categories.\n\nIn 1989, Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the Max Q project, and was joined by members of Olsen's previous groups including Whirlywirld, No and Orchestra of Skin and Bone. They released a self-titled album and three singles, \"Way of the World\", \"Sometimes\" and \"Monday Night by Satellite\". Max Q disbanded in 1990. Max Q showed Hutchence exploring the darker side of his music and, with Olsen, he created \"one of the most innovative dance music albums of the decade\". Hutchence wrote most of the music and provided \"an extraordinary performance ... it was one of the most significant statements Hutchence was to make\". In 1990, Hutchence portrayed nineteenth-century Romantic poet Percy Shelley in Roger Corman's film version of Frankenstein Unbound, which was based on a science fiction time travel story of the same name written by Brian Aldiss.\n\nIn 1990, INXS released X, which spawned more international hits such as \"Suicide Blonde\" and \"Disappear\" (both Top 10 in the US). \"Suicide Blonde\" peaked at No. 2 in Australia and No. 11 in the UK. Hutchence, with Andrew Farriss, wrote the song after Hutchence's then-girlfriend, Kylie Minogue, used the phrase \"suicide blonde\" to describe her look during  her 1989 film, The Delinquents; the film depicted Minogue in a platinum blonde wig. Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the 1991 BRIT Awards with INXS winning the related group award. Hutchence provided vocals for pub rockers Noiseworks' album, Love Versus Money (1991).\n\nWelcome to Wherever You Are was released in August 1992, but INXS did not tour to support the album. It received good critical reviews and went to No. 1 in the UK and in Sweden, No. 2 in Australia and Switzerland, and No. 3 in Norway, but had less chart success in the U.S.; there, it peaked at No. 16.\n\nLater career\n\nHutchence and INXS faced reduced commercial success with Full Moon, Dirty Hearts, especially in the U.S. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through his romances. He commenced work on a self-titled solo album in the mid-1990s. \n\nAfter a period of inactivity and releases that received lukewarm reviews, INXS recorded the band's 10th official album, Elegantly Wasted, in 1996, produced by Bruce Fairbairn and Andrew Farriss.\n\nArtistry\n\nIn 2013, News.com.au ranked Hutchence fourth in a list of the 15 greatest Australian singers of all time. Billboard has described Hutchence as \"charismatic,\" with a \"seductive purr and [a] lithe, magnetic stage presence.\" Paul Donoughue of ABC.net.au has written that Hutchence had \"a phenomenal voice — moody, sexual, and dynamic, able to shift effortlessly from fragile to cocksure.\" Reviewing an INXS concert, Dave Simpson of The Guardian wrote, \"Watching Hutchence, hair flailing, crotch thrusting, a mischievous smile forever creeping across his leathery face, I realised that here was a man born to be onstage, living and loving every minute, an explosion of sexual energy. Hutchence biographer Toby Creswell has written that \"Hutchence was, without question, one of the truly great frontmen — he expressed the music in a dynamic way that few others could.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nAccording to People, Hutchence's “public brawls and onetime open drug use led London [tabloids] to dub him the ‘wild man of rock.’”http://people.com/archive/inx-plicable-vol-48-no-23/\n\nHutchence was romantically linked to Kylie Minogue, Belinda Carlisle,http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/carlisle-opens-up-about-hutchence/news-story/9b5053f804807ab6709f6ac676b74e06 Helena Christensen, and Kym Wilson.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/kym-wilson-on-the-death-of-michael-hutchence-and-the-turning-point-in-my-life/news-story/25f1d831a7b14aa0ca91ef8be2dbb566\n\nIn August 1992, Helena Christensen and Hutchence were walking after drinking heavily when he refused to move for a taxi. The taxi driver then assaulted him, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the roadway. Hutchence suffered a fractured skull in the altercation. Hutchence did not immediately seek medical assistance for the injury, instead waiting several days before seeing a doctor. As a result, Hutchence's fractured skull left him with an almost complete loss of the sense of smell and significant loss of taste. This led to periods of depression and increased levels of aggression; he had not fully recovered after two weeks in a Copenhagen hospital. According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence pulled a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of Full Moon, Dirty Hearts on the isle of Capri. \"Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band. Suicide blonde, right?\"\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hutchence became romantically involved with Paula Yates. He had met Yates in 1985, during an interview for her program, The Tube. Yates interviewed Hutchence again in 1994 for her Big Breakfast show, and their affair was soon uncovered by the British press. At the time, Yates was married to The Boomtown Rats' lead singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Media scrutiny was intense, and Hutchence assaulted a photographer who had followed the couple. Yates' separation from Geldof in February 1995 sparked a public and at times bitter custody battle over their daughters. Yates and Geldof divorced in May 1996. \n\nOn 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to Hutchence's only child, their daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, who Yates claimed was delivered in their bathroom. Like her half-sisters, she was christened with an unusual name. Pixie chose Heavenly, Hutchence picked Hiraani, and Yates provided Tiger Lily; she was called Tiger and Hutchence described her as \"just what we ordered\". \n\nIn September 1996, Yates and Hutchence made headlines again when they were arrested for suspicion of drug possession after the family nanny reportedly found a small amount of opium in a shoebox under their bed. The case was later dropped for lack of evidence.\n\nDeath\n\nHutchence and INXS went on a world tour to support the April 1997 release of Elegantly Wasted. The final leg of their 20th anniversary tour was to occur in Australia in November and December. During the tour, Yates planned to visit Hutchence with his daughter and Yates's three children, but Geldof had taken legal action to prevent the visit. On the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence, aged 37, was found dead in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay, Sydney.\n\nGeldof and Yates each gave police statements on the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence on the morning of his death; however, they did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of Tiger's custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not bring her to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence \"was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby... [he] was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'\". Yates indicated that Hutchence said he was going to phone Geldof \"to let Tiger come to Australia\". Geldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence, who was \"hectoring and abusive and threatening\" during their phone conversation. The occupant in the room next to Hutchence's heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5 AM; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.\n\nHutchence's former girlfriend Kym Wilson and her then-boyfriend, Andrew Reyment, were the last people to see Hutchence alive; when they left him at 4:50 AM on the day of his death, he was still awaiting a phone call from Yates. Hutchence's second-to-last outgoing phone call was made to his personal manager, Martha Troup; in a voice-mail message, he said, \"Marth, Michael here. I've fucking had enough.\" When Troup returned the call, there was no answer. At 9:54 AM, Hutchence spoke with a former longtime girlfriend, Michèle Bennett, who stated that he was crying, sounded upset, and told her he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his door at about 10:40 AM, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50 AM. Police reported that Hutchence was found \"in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snake skin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure at the top of the door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken.\"\n\nOn 6 February 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report. The report ruled that Hutchence's death was a suicide while depressed and under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. \"An analysis report of Hutchence's blood [indicated] the presence of alcohol, cocaine, Prozac and prescription drugs.\" In a 1999 interview on 60 Minutes (and in a documentary film on Channel 4), Yates claimed that Hutchence's death may have resulted from autoerotic asphyxiation; this claim contradicted her previous statements to police investigators and the coroner. In producing his coroner's report, Hand had specifically considered the suggestions of accidental death (coupled with the fact that Hutchence left no suicide note), but had discounted them based on substantial evidence presented to the contrary. Despite the official coroner's report, fans and relatives considered his death accidental. In 2000, Patricia Glassop (Hutchence's mother, who had remarried) and Tina Schorr (his sister), gave an interview on This Morning, asserting that Yates had on more than one occasion threatened to harm herself or Tiger if Hutchence did not marry her; they believed that Yates had made similar statements to Hutchence on the morning of his death, directly precipitating his suicide.\n\nOn 27 November, Hutchence's funeral was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. His casket was carried out of the cathedral by members of INXS and by his younger brother, Rhett; \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. Nick Cave, a friend of Hutchence, performed his 1997 song \"Into My Arms\" during the funeral and requested that television cameras be switched off. Rhett claimed in his 2004 book, Total XS, that on the previous day at the funeral parlour, Yates had put a gram of heroin into Hutchence's pocket. He was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney,[http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page\ncem&FScemeteryid=639480 find-a-grave]; Retrieved 7 August 2013 and his ashes were scattered on Sydney Harbour in Rose Bay on 22 January 1998.\n\nLater developments\n\nINXS decided to continue without Hutchence, replacing him in November 1998 with Jimmy Barnes, then in June 1999 with Terence Trent D'Arby. Jon Stevens covered vocals during 2000–2002, but in 2005, INXS took their search for a lead singer to Rock Star: INXS, a reality TV show on CBS. The winner was Canadian singer J.D. Fortune.\n\nHutchence's solo album, Michael Hutchence, was finally released in October 1999. He had started on the album in 1995, recording songs in between INXS sessions and had last worked on it three days prior to his death. The last song he recorded was \"Possibilities\". The album was co-written and co-produced by Hutchence and various collaborators – Andy Gill (Gang of Four), Bernard Fowler (The Rolling Stones backing singer), Tim Simenon (Bomb the Bass), and Danny Saber (Black Grape). It has a duet with U2's Bono, \"Slide Away\", with Bono's vocals recorded after Hutchence's death. \n\nThe 1999 movie, Limp includes a cameo by Hutchence, playing a record company A&R man; he had filmed his scene in 1996 on a day off from working on INXS's Elegantly Wasted.\n\nOn 18 June 2000, Patricia Glassop and Tina Schorr released their book, Just a Man: The Real Michael Hutchence, which has been described as \"an odd biography ... [that] combines the basic facts of Hutchence's early life ... with an almost too-intimate view of the authors' feelings\". \n\nPaula Yates died on 17 September of an accidental heroin overdose; she was discovered by four-year-old Tiger. Geldof filed for custody of Tiger the next day. Although Geldof was not biologically related to Tiger, he wanted her to be raised with her half-sisters. Hutchence's family members were not given Geldof's permission to join the custody hearings; Patricia and Tina initiated legal proceedings to pursue custody. Geldof legally adopted Tiger, against the wishes of Patricia and Tina, who disagreed with Geldof changing her surname to Hutchence-Geldof. \n\nOn 12 December 2002, Hutchence's father, Kelland, died of cancer in Sydney. Kelland had helped create and maintain a memorial website for his son from 1999.\n\nOn 20 August 2005, Melbourne's The Age reported on the disposition of Hutchence's estate and assets, estimated at between $10 to $20 million but containing virtually nothing. The remainder of his estate had been sold off and swallowed in legal fees..\n\nPatricia Glassop died on 21 September 2010. In July 2009, Patricia had protested that Geldof had prevented access to her granddaughter for three years, \"It's totally cruel and unnecessary. I've lost my husband and now I have a granddaughter who doesn't even know her beloved Grandpa Ross [Glassop] has died. We have been completely cut out of her life by Bob Geldof.\"  Tiger was not in attendance at her grandmother's funeral due to Geldof's fear of the attention that would be generated. Her uncle Rhett indicated that Geldof had sent condolences, that he had spoken to Tiger and agreed it was advisable to keep the 14-year-old out of the media.\n\nDiscography \n\nSolo \n\n;Albums\n* Michael Hutchence (1999)\n\n;Singles\n* \"Speed Kills\" (1981)\n* \"Rooms for the Memory\" (1986)\n* \"A Strait Line\" (1999)\n\nWith Max Q\n\n* Max Q (1989), (see Max Q)\n\nWith INXS\n\nCollaborations and soundtracks \n\n* Freedom Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1982) – \"Speed Kills\", \"Forest Theme\" (with Don Walker of Cold Chisel)\n* Flame Fortune (1985) – \"Sex Symbol\", \"Jungle Boy\"\n*  Dogs in Space Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1987) – \"Dogs in Space\", \"Golf Course\", \"The Green Dragon\", \"Rooms for the Memory\"\n* Symphonic Music of the Rolling Stones (1994) – \"Under My Thumb\"\n* It's Now or Never: The Tribute The Elvis (1994) – \"Baby Let's Play House\"\n* Batman Forever Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1995) – \"The Passenger\"\n* Barb Wire Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1996) – \"Spill the Wine\"\n* One Voice: The Songs of Chage & Aska (1996) – \"Red Hill\"\n* No Talking, Just Head (1996) – \"The King Is Gone\" (The Heads with Michael Hutchence)\n\nTributes and dedications \n\n* Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, a friend of Hutchence and Yates, and Geldof's best man, wrote \"Michael\". It was recorded in 1996 and released on Medazzaland a month before Hutchence's death. Its lyrics include:\n:\"Trust you to get caught up in somebody's war; you'll come out of it all intact, I'm sure.\n:Just remember what friends were put here for;\n:Michael, you've got a lot to answer for, and I know that you're gonna call ... if you need me.\"\nDuran Duran was touring to support the album when Hutchence died and Le Bon found the song too difficult to perform at Lakewood Civic Auditorium, Lakewood (Cleveland), Ohio, United States. Le Bon was in tears through part of this show and the song was cut from the set list for the remainder of the tour. During subsequent tours it was reincluded, with Le Bon introducing the song by saying that he wanted to remember Hutchence for the way he lived instead of the way he died.\n* Nick Cave sang \"Into My Arms\" at the funeral on 27 November 1997, which was broadcast live on Australian TV. Out of respect, Cave requested the song not be televised.\n* Kylie Minogue recorded a tribute song to Hutchence for her 2000 album Light Years titled \"Bittersweet Goodbye\" and later covered \"Need You Tonight\" on her 2014 Kiss Me Once world tour. \n* Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins wrote \"Shame\" on their 1998 album Adore.\n* Powderfinger's \"Private Man\" on their 1998 album Internationalist.\n* The Church's \"This is It\" on their 1998 album Hologram of Baal.\n* Terri Nunn of Berlin and Corgan collaborated on \"Sacred and Profane\" for Berlin's 2000 album Live: Sacred & Profane. Nunn said, \"He was a very big inspiration for both Billy and me. The song is about my first experience seeing him because that changed my life. He influenced me probably more than anyone else as a performer. I became 12 years old in five minutes wanting to have sex with him. That's all I wanted! Oh my God. Everybody did! You just wanted him. He was the epitome of rock star.\"\n* U2 and Bono have made several tributes:\n** Bono, a close friend of Hutchence, wrote \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" on the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which he tries to convince Hutchence of its foolishness. Bono characterised it as a good old row between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence in real life. In a 2005 interview, Bono regretted that he had not spent more time with Hutchence. Bono's wife, Alison Hewson, had seen Hutchence prior to his death and noted \"he looked a bit shaky to [her].\"\n** Bono dedicated \"One\" to Hutchence on the live video PopMart: Live from Mexico City. During the intro he refers to Hutchence as \"a great mate, a great singer\".\n** On both PopMart and Elevation Tours, Bono dedicated \"Gone\"  to Hutchence by yelling \"Hutch!\" at its beginning.\n** On U2's Vertigo Tour, on 13 November 2006 in Sydney, Bono said \"Blow a kiss to Heaven to Michael Hutchence\" before playing \"With or Without You\".\n** On 24 November 2007, U2 played a secret gig at the Little Noise Sessions in Islington, London. During their performance of \"Desire\", Bono changed the lyrics of a verse to include a line from INXS' \"Need You Tonight\", \"I've got to let you know / You're one of my kind.\"\n* INXS dedicated many performances to Hutchence, including:\n** \"Never Tear Us Apart\", which was dedicated to Hutchence when performed on the 2002 Just For Kicks tour. During performances of the song, a screen showed pictures of Hutchence throughout his life.\n** \"God's Top Ten\", from the band's 2005 Switch album, is dedicated to Hutchence and his daughter, Tiger\n** \"Afterglow\", also from the band's Switch album, is dedicated to Hutchence alone.\n* At a 2007 show in Adelaide supporting INXS, Simple Minds's vocalist Jim Kerr dedicated \"Gloria\" to Hutchence, saying \"it's about a woman, but it'd have to be with Michael\". At a New Zealand show two months later, he rededicated \"Gloria\".\n* Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed \"Don't Change\" during their High Hopes Tour on the show of 19 February 2014 in Sydney, Australia, and played it for the first time in the United States in Albany, New York, on 13 May 2014.
