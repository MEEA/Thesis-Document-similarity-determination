  "textBody" : "This article is about the demographic features of the population of Morocco, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nThe population of Morocco in 2014 is 33,848,242. The overwhelming majority of Moroccans are of Berber descent. Those who identify as Arab-Berbers are genetically nearly identical to non-Arab Berbers, suggesting that the processes of 'Arabization' were almost entirely cultural rather than genetic. Bosch, Elena et al. \"Genetic structure of north-west Africa revealed by STR analysis.\" European Journal of Human Genetics (2000) 8, 360–366. Pg. 365 Some Moroccans identify themselves as Berbers through the spoken language, through a mix of family/tribal/territorial ties or through both. Other Moroccans identify themselves as Arabised Berbers, mostly based on them speaking Arabic or being coerced to speak Arabic and/or not being able to speak Berber. However, due to Arabisation and its policies, some of them believe they have Arab descent from the Arabian Peninsula or the Levant. Some Moroccans believe themselves to be of mixed Arab-Berber descent or of Arab-Berber-Andalusian ancestry. There are no official figures about the exact ethnic origins of all Moroccans, but the implicitly accepted idea inside and outside Morocco is that Moroccans are essentially mixed Arab-Berbers. However, a recent study by the National Geographic showed the majority of North Africa are predominantly of non-Arab ancestry, thus Amazigh.\n\nMorocco has been inhabited by Berbers (Imazighen) since at least 5,000 years ago. Some estimate the presence of Berbers to be 8,000+ years old. The oldest known sovereign state in Morocco is the Berber Kingdom of Mauretaina established in 110 BC. Part of the northern areas of Morocco was for limited periods under the rule of Romans and Byzantine principalities, sometimes in alliance with the indigenous Berbers, such as the one of Julian, count of Ceuta. There was probably a high occurrence of intermarriage and interbreeding between some Berbers and European settlers, laying the foundation for the emergence of Moorish and Romano-Berber cultures. Since around 710 AD, many Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula and Arabised Levantine people conquered the territory or migrated to it during the Umayyad conquest, though historical scholars argue that the amount of the population that remained Arab is minimal. The deep and mountainous areas of ancient Morocco always remained under Berber control. A small minority of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnaoua, dark-skinned sedentary agriculturalists of the southern oases that speak either Tamazight or Darija.\n\nAbout 95% of Moroccans are considered to be Sunni Muslims religiously or culturally. The numbers of the Jewish minority has decreased significantly since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Today there are fewer than 5,000 Moroccan Jews inside the country. Thousands of Moroccan Jews living in Europe, Israel and North America visit the country regularly. There is a small but apparently growing minority of Moroccan Christians made of local Moroccan converts (not Europeans). Estimates of Moroccan Christians vary wildly between 30,000 and 300,000. In 2014, most of the 86,206 foreign residents are French people, Spaniards, Algerians and sub-Saharan African students. There is a small community of Shia Muslim converts in northwestern Morocco of unknown numbers. Both Christian and Shia Muslim Moroccans and their religious activities are under surveillance and restrictions from Moroccan authorities as they are seen as a threat to the dominance of Sunni Islam and the monarch's religious authority. The number of non-believers and non-religious Moroccans is unknown but could be in the 100,000s. Secular, non-religious and Western life styles are visible in all major Moroccan cities among many rich or educated Moroccans. For example, Moroccans consume every year hundreds of millions of litres of locally and legally produced wine and beer. As alcohol beverages are banned by Islam, their consumption in Morocco is usually considered as a strong indicator of non-religiosity or of a secular life style that departs from traditional life style in general.\n\nPopulation\n\nSource: Haut-Commissariat au Plan (HCP)\n\nFertility rate (The Demographic Health Survey) \n\nFigures from The Demographic Health Survey\n\nFertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and CBR (Crude Birth Rate):\n\nStructure of the population \n\nStructure of the population (Census 2004):\n\nAccording to 2004 census\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates based on the results of the 2004 Population Census) :\n\nStructure of the population (Census 2014) :\n\nAccording to 2014 census\n\nLanguages\n\nModern Standard Arabic and the Berber (Tamazight) are Morocco's two official languages. The spoken languages in daily life are: (Moroccan Arabic (Darija), Tamazight (Riffian, Tamazight, Tashelhit), Hassaniya Arabic (in the extreme south only), and Berber languages.\n\nAround 30-33 million Moroccans speak Moroccan Arabic (which has also regional varieties) as a first language, including Hilalian dialects and Hassaniya Arabic in the extreme south of the country.\n\nAround 12-15 million Moroccans speak Berber languages in three varieties (Rif-Berber, Shilha, and Central Atlas Tamazight) as a first language.\n\nFrench is an implicitly \"official language\" of government and big business, and is taught throughout school and still serves as Morocco's primary language of business, economics, and scientific university education. French is also widely used in the media. Morocco is a member of La Francophonie. Berber activists have struggled since the 1960s for the recognition of their language as an official language of Morocco, which was achieved in July 2011 following the February 20th 2011 uprising.\n\nAbout 20,000 Moroccans in the northern part of the country speak some Spanish.\n\nEnglish, while still far behind French in terms of the number of proficient speakers, is rapidly becoming a foreign language of choice among educated youth and business people. It has been taught to Moroccan students after the fourth year of elementary school since the education reforms of 2002.\n\nStatus of women\n\nThe literacy rate is 51 percent for males and 42.5 percent for females. 26 percent of the non-agricultural labor is female. The ratio of boys to girls in primary and secondary schools is 87 to 9. In the past 20 years, the government has taken initiatives to improve the status of women in society. For instance, the Moudawana 2003 code of law has greatly improved the family status code. It has given women the right to make decisions on marriage, divorce, and custody of children in the case of remarriage/divorce. Nevertheless, gender bias is still commonplace in education, employment and the law.\n\nMain populated areas\n\nMost Moroccans live west and north of the Atlas Mountains, a range that insulates the country from the Sahara Desert. Casablanca is the largest city and the centre of business and industry, and has the leading seaport and airport. Rabat is the seat of government. Tangier and Nador are the two major northern seaports on the Mediterranean. Fez is a cultural, religious and industrial centre. Marrakesh and Agadir are the two major tourist centres. Oujda is the largest city of eastern Morocco. Meknes houses the military academy. Kenitra has the largest military airbase. Mohammedia has the largest oil refineries and other major industrial installations.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school (age 15). Nevertheless, many children—particularly girls in rural areas—still do not attend school. The country's illiteracy rate is usually around 50 percent for most of the country, but reaches as high as 90 percent among girls in rural regions. In July 2006, Prime minister Driss Jettou announced that illiteracy rate has declined by 39 percent, while two million people had attended literacy courses during the past four years.[http://www.moroccotimes.com/News/article.asp?id=15968]  \n\nMorocco has about 660,000 students enrolled in 14 public universities. The oldest and among the most prestigious is Mohammed V in Rabat, with faculties of law, sciences, liberal arts, and medicine. University of Karueein, in Fez, has been a centre for Islamic studies for more than 1,000 years. Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, founded in 1993 by King Hassan II and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, is an English-medium, American-style university comprising about 1,700 students.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nNationality\nnoun: Moroccan(s)\nadjective: Moroccan\n\nVital Statistics\n\nPopulation\n33 million (2014)\n\nAge structure\n0-14 years: 27.8% (male 4,514,623/female 4,382,487)\n15-64 years: 66.1% (male 10,335,931/female 10,785,380)\n65 years and over: 6.1% (male 881,622/female 1,068,318) (2011 est.)\n\nMedian age\ntotal: 26.9 years\nmale: 26.3 years\nfemale: 27.4 years (2011 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate\n1.054% (2012 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate\n2.50 children born/woman (2004)\n2.59 children born/woman (2011)\n\nBirth rate\n18.97 births/1,000 population (2012 est.)\n\nDeath rate\n4.76 deaths/1,000 population (July 2012 est.)\n\nNet migration rate\n-3.67 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2012 est.)\n\nUrbanization\nurban population: 58% of total population (2010)\nrate of urbanization: 2.1% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)\n\nSex ratio\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years: 1.03 male(s)/female\n15-64 years: 0.96 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.82 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 0.97 male(s)/female (2012 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate\ntotal: 26.49 deaths/1,000 live births\nmale: 31.16 deaths/1,000 live births\nfemale: 21.59 deaths/1,000 live births (2012 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\ntotal population: 76.11 years\nmale: 73.04 years\nfemale: 79.32 years (2012 est.)\n\nEthnic groups\n\n \n*Arabs and Berbers 99%\n*Other 1%\n\nLanguages \n\n*Arabic (official)\n*Berber (Tamazight (official), Tachelhit, Tarifit)\n*French (often the language of business, government, and diplomacy)\n*Spanish (spoken in northern region)\n\nReligions\n\n*Sunni Islam 99% (official) (0.1% Shia)\n*Other 1% (includes Christian, Jewish, and Baha'i )\n\nLiteracy\n\nDefinition: age 10 and over can read and write\n\nTotal population: 73.55% (2012)\n:Category:Education in Morocco",
