Individual cultures have their own names, in their respective Indigenous languages, for the spiritual healers and ceremonial leaders in their particular cultures. \n\nThe medicine man and woman in North America\n\nCultural context\n\nIn the ceremonial context of Indigenous North American communities, \"medicine\" usually refers to spiritual healing. Medicine men/women should not be confused with those who employ Native American ethnobotany, a practice that is very common in a large number of Native American and First Nations households.Alcoze, Dr Thomas M.  \"[https://www.bgci.org/resources/article/0429/ Ethnobotany from a Native American Perspective: Restoring Our Relationship with the Earth]\" in Botanic Gardens Conservation International Volume 1 Number 19 - December 1999Moerman, Daniel E. \"[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378874179900023 Symbols and selectivity: A statistical analysis of native american medical ethnobotany]\" in Journal of Ethnopharmacology Volume 1, Issue 2, April 1979, Pages 111-119Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, \"[http://na.fs.fed.us/stewardship/pubs/biodiversity/sustaining-lives-natural-world.pdf Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Sustaining Our Lives and the Natural World]\" at United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. Newtown Square, PA. December 2011\n\nThe terms \"medicine people\" or \"ceremonial people\" are sometimes used in Native American and First Nations communities, for example, when Arwen Nuttall (Cherokee) of the National Museum of the American Indian writes, \"The knowledge possessed by medicine people is privileged, and it often remains in particular families.\"National Museum of the American Indian. Do All Indians Live in Tipis? Washington DC: Smithsonian Institution, 2007. .\n\nNative Americans tend to be quite reluctant to discuss issues about medicine or medicine people with non-Indians. In some cultures, the people will not even discuss these matters with Indians from other tribes. In most tribes, medicine elders are prohibited from advertising or introducing themselves as such. As Nuttall writes, \"An inquiry to a Native person about religious beliefs or ceremonies is often viewed with suspicion.\" One example of this is the Apache medicine cord or Izze-kloth whose purpose and use by Apache medicine elders was a mystery to nineteenth century ethnologists because \"the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or talk about them.\"\n \nThe 1954 version of Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language reflects the poorly-grounded perceptions of the people whose use of the term effectively defined it for the people of that time: \"a man supposed to have supernatural powers of curing disease and controlling spirits.\" In effect, such definitions were not explanations of what these \"medicine people\" are to their own communities but instead reported on the consensus of socially and psychologically remote observers when they tried to categorize the individuals. The term \"medicine man/woman,\" like the term \"shaman,\" has been criticized by Native Americans, as well as other specialists in the fields of religion and anthropology.\n\nWhile non-Native anthropologists sometimes use the term \"shaman\" for Indigenous healers worldwide, including the Americas, \"shaman\" is the specific name for a spiritual mediator from the Tungusic peoples of SiberiaSmith, C. R. [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/shaman.html \"Shamanism.\"] Cabrillo College.

The Cherokee people were among the first Native Americans to formalize a written language. Some of the  information in the Cherokee ledgers is written in code to prevent other people from trying to misuse or exploit their medicine ways. As in all Native American cultures, Cherokee medicine people had to practice in secret from the post-contact era until 1978, when the American Indian Religious Freedom Act was passed.  \n\nTraining a Cherokee medicine person takes many years due to the vast amount of knowledge needed to practice. Modern-day Cherokee medicine people must be born and raised in the Cherokee community and culture, and raised with the language. The skills of gifted and well-trained medicine people are still very important to the Cherokee people, though genocide and oppression have resulted in there being fewer now than pre-contact. There are many fraudulent healers and scam artists who pose as Cherokee \"shamans\", and the Cherokee Nation has had to speak out against these people, even forming a task force to handle the issue.
