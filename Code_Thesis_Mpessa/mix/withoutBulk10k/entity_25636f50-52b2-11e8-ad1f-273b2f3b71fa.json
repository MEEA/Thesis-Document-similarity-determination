  "textBody" : "John DowlandWhile orthographic evidence from Dowland's time strongly suggests a pronunciation of for the last name, there is no consensus on the correct pronunciation. By analogy with the name Cowper and the Restoration poet Abraham Cowley, the pronunciation is suggested. (1563 – buried 20 February 1626) was an English Renaissance composer, lutenist, and singer. He is best known today for his melancholy songs such as \"Come, heavy sleep\" (the basis of Benjamin Britten's 1963 composition for guitar solo, Nocturnal after John Dowland), \"Come again\", \"Flow my tears\", \"I saw my Lady weepe\" and \"In darkness let me dwell\", but his instrumental music has undergone a major revival, and with the 20th century's early music revival, has been a continuing source of repertoire for lutenists and classical guitarists.\n\nCareer and compositions\n\nVery little is known of John Dowland's early life, but it is generally thought he was born in London. Irish historian W. H. Grattan Flood claimed that he was born in Dalkey, near Dublin,W. H. Grattan Flood, The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 301 (1906), pp. 287–91. See Diana Poulton, John Dowland, University of California Press (1982), pp. 21ff. for a full discussion of this claim. [https://books.google.com/books?idgM4ikvRR4Z0C] but no corroborating evidence has ever been found either for that statement or for Thomas Fuller's claim that he was born in Westminster.Peter Holman/Paul O'Dette: \"John Dowland\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed 10 July 2007), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)] There is however one very clear piece of evidence pointing to Dublin as his place of origin: he dedicated the song \"From Silent Night\" to 'my loving countryman Mr. John Forster the younger, merchant of Dublin in Ireland'. The Forsters were a prominent Dublin family at the time, providing several Lord Mayors to the city.See A. L. Rowse, Discoveries and Reviews from Renaissance to Restoration (London, Macmillan, 1975), p.194: \"'Countryman', in Elizabethan usage, refers to one's own county or locality. When Dowland refers to himself as 'born under her Highness', I think that phrase is more likely to imply birth in Ireland than in England.\" Dublin and the area around it were effectively governed from London, in contrast with the rest of Ireland which was nominally governed by England in a rule that was contested where applied. However, the English-speaking inhabitants of Dublin, pace Diana Poulton p.25, did commonly call themselves English, right up to the time of the Duke of Wellington. In 1580 Dowland went to Paris, where he was in service to Sir Henry Cobham, the ambassador to the French court, and his successor, Sir Edward Stafford.Douglas Alton Smith, A History of the Lute from Antiquity to the Renaissance (The Lute Society of America, Inc., 2002), p.275 He became a Roman Catholic at this time.Peter Warlock, The English Ayre (Greenwood Press, Publishers, 1970), 24.  Excerpt from Dowland's letter of 1595 to Sir Robert Cecil. In 1584, Dowland moved back to England where he was married. In 1588 he was admitted Mus. Bac. from Christ Church, Oxford.Diana Poulton, John Dowland (Faber & Faber, 1982), 28. In 1594 a vacancy for a lutenist came up at the English court, but Dowland's application was unsuccessful – he claimed his religion led to his not being offered a post at Elizabeth I's Protestant court. However, his conversion was not publicised, and being Catholic did not prevent some other important musicians (such as William Byrd) from having a court career in England.\n\nFrom 1598 Dowland worked at the court of Christian IV of Denmark,Warlock 1970, p.32 though he continued to publish in London.Warlock 1970, p.34 King Christian was very interested in musicWarlock 1970, p.33 and paid Dowland astronomical sums; his salary was 500 daler a year, making him one of the highest-paid servants of the Danish court.Smith 2002, p.276 Though Dowland was highly regarded by King Christian, he was not the ideal servant, often overstaying his leave when he went to England on publishing business or for other reasons. Dowland was dismissed in 1606 and returned to England; in early 1612 he secured a post as one of James I's lutenists.Matthew Spring, The Lute in Britain: a History of the Instrument and its Music (Oxford University Press, 2001), p.108 There are few compositions dating from the moment of his royal appointment until his death in London in 1626.Spring 2001, p.109 While the date of his death is not known, \"Dowland's last payment from the court was on 20 January 1626, and he was buried at St Ann's, Blackfriars, London, on 20 February 1626.\"David Greer, \"John Dowland\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online.\n\nTwo major influences on Dowland's music were the popular consort songs, and the dance music of the day.Abraham 1968, p.204-5 Most of Dowland's music is for his own instrument, the lute.Abraham 1968, p.201 It includes several books of solo lute works, lute songs (for one voice and lute), part-songs with lute accompaniment, and several pieces for viol consort with lute.Smith 2002, pp.274–83 The poet Richard Barnfield wrote that Dowland's \"heavenly touch upon the lute doth ravish human sense.\"\n\nOne of his better known works is the lute song \"Flow my tears\", the first verse of which runs:\n\nHe later wrote what is probably his best known instrumental work, Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares, Figured in Seaven Passionate Pavans, a set of seven pavanes for five viols and lute, each based on the theme derived from the lute song \"Flow my tears\".Smith 2002, p.276-7 It became one of the best known collections of consort music in his time. His pavane, \"Lachrymae antiquae\", was also popular in the seventeenth century, and was arranged and used as a theme for variations by many composers. He wrote a lute version of the popular ballad \"My Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home\".\n\nDowland's music often displays the melancholia that was so fashionable in music at that time.Anthony Rooley, \"New Light on John Dowland's Songs of Darkness,\" Early Music 11.1 (January 1983): p.6 He wrote a consort piece with the punning title \"Semper Dowland, semper dolens\" (always Dowland, always doleful), which may be said to sum up much of his work.http://www.goldbergweb.com/en/magazine/composers/2005/2/38613_print.php\n\nDowland's song, \"Come Heavy Sleepe, the Image of True Death\", was the inspiration for Benjamin Britten's Nocturnal after John Dowland, written in 1963 for the guitarist Julian Bream. This work consists of eight variations, all based on musical themes drawn from the song or its lute accompaniment, finally resolving into a guitar setting of the song itself.Smith 2002, p.289\n\nRichard Barnfield, Dowland's contemporary, refers to him in poem VIII of The Passionate Pilgrim (1598), a Shakespearean sonnet:\n\nPublished works\n\nThere is no complete catalogue of Dowland's works. The fullest list is that compiled by Diana Poulton in her The collected Lute Music of John Dowland. P numbers are therefore sometimes used to designate individual pieces.\n\nWhole Book of Psalms (1592) \n\nPublished by Thomas Est in 1592, The Whole Booke of Psalmes contained works by 10 composers, including 6 pieces by Dowland.\n# Put me not to rebuke, O Lord (Psalm 38)\n# All people that on earth do dwell (Psalm 100)\n# My soul praise the Lord (Psalm 104)\n# Lord to thee I make my moan (Psalm 130)\n# Behold and have regard (Psalm 134)\n# A Prayer for the Queens most excellent Maiestie\n\nNew Book of Tablature (1596) \n\nThe New Booke of Tabliture was published by William Barley in 1596. It contains seven solo lute pieces by Dowland.\n\nLamentatio Henrici Noel (1596) \n\nWritten for the professional choir of Westminster Abbey.[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/geistliches_e.html]\n# The Lamentation of a sinner\n# Domine ne in furore (Psalm 6)\n# Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51)\n# The humble sute of a sinner\n# The humble complaint of a sinner\n# De profundis (Psalm 130)\n# Domine exaudi (Psalm 143)\n\nOf uncertain attribution are:\n# Ye righteous in the Lord\n# An heart that's broken\n# I shame at my unworthiness\n\nFirst Book of Songs (1597) \n\nDowland published his The First Booke of Songes or Ayres in London in 1597.  It was one of the most influential and important musical publications of the history of the lute. This collection of lute-songs was set out in a way that allows performance by a soloist with lute accompaniment or various combinations of singers and instrumentalists.Gerald Abraham. ed. The New Oxford History of Music, Volume IV: The Age of Humanism 1540–1630 (London: Oxford University Press, 1968), p. 203\n\nThe 21 songs are:[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/first_e.html]\n# Vnquiet thoughts\n# Who euer thinks or hopes of loue for loue\n# My thoughts are wingd with hopes\n# If my complaints could passions moue\n# Can she excuse my wrongs with vertues cloake\n# Now, O now I needs must part\n# Deare if you change ile neuer chuse againe\n# Burst forth my teares\n# Go Cristall teares\n# Thinkst thou then by thy faining\n# Come away, come sweet loue\n# Rest awhile you cruell cares\n# Sleepe wayward thoughts\n# All ye whom loue of fortune hath betraide\n# Wilt though vnkind thus reaue me of my hart\n# Would my conceit that first enforst my woe\n# Come again: sweet loue doth now enuite\n# His goulden locks time hath to siluer turnd\n# Awake sweet loue thou art returned\n# Come heauy sleepe\n# Awaie with these selfe louing lads\n\nSecond Book of Songs (1600) \n\nDowland published The Second Booke of Songs or Ayres, in 1600.\n\nThe songs are:[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/second_e.html]\n# I saw my Lady weepe\n# Flow my teares fall from your springs\n# Sorow sorow stay, lend true repentant teares\n# Dye not before thy day\n# Mourne, mourne, day is with darknesse fled\n# Tymes eldest sonne, old age the heire of ease, First part\n# Then sit thee downe, and say thy Nunc demittis, Second Part\n# When others sings Venite exultemus, Third part\n# Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceipt\n# O sweet woods, the delight of solitarienesse\n# If fluds of teares could clense my follies past\n# Fine knacks for Ladies, cheap, choise, braue and new\n# Now cease my wandring eyes\n# Come ye heavie states of night\n# White as Lillies was hir face\n# Wofull heart with griefe oppressed\n# A Sheperd in a shade his plaining made\n# Faction that euer dwells in court\n# Shall I sue, shall I seeke for grace\n# Finding in fields my Siluia all alone (Toss not my soul)\n# Cleare or Cloudie sweet as Aprill showring\n# Humor say what makst thou heere\n# Dowland's Adieu for Master Oliver Cromwell\n\nThird Book of Songs (1603) \n\nThe Third and Last Booke of Songs or Aires was published in 1603.\n\nThe 21 songs are:\n# Farewell too faire\n# Time stands still\n# Behold the wonder heere\n# Daphne wast not so chaste as she was changing\n# Me me and none but me\n# When Phoebus first did Daphne loue\n# Say loue if euer thou didst finde\n# Flow not so fast ye fountaines\n# What if I neuer speede\n# Loue stood amaz'd at sweet beauties paine\n# Lend your eares to my sorrow good people\n# By a fountaine where I lay\n# Oh what hath ouerwrought my all amazed thought\n# Farewell vnkind farewell\n# Weepe you no more sad fountaines\n# Fie on this faining, is loue without desire\n# I must complaine, yet doe enioy\n# It was a time when silly Bees could speake\n# The lowest trees haue tops\n# What poore Astronomers are they\n# Come when I call, or tarrie till I come\n\nLachrimae (1604) \n\nThe Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares was published in 1604. It contains the seven pavans of Lachrimae itself and 14 others, including the famous Semper Dowland semper Dolens.\n# Lachrimae Antiquae\n# Lachrimae Antiquae Nouae\n# Lachrimae Gementes\n# Lachrimae Tristes\n# Lachrimae Coactae\n# Lachrimae Amantis\n# Lachrimae Verae\n# Semper Dowland semper Dolens (P.9)\n# Sir Henry Vmptons Funeral\n# M.

George Whitehead his Almand\n\nMicrologus (1609) \n\nDowland published  a translation of the Micrologus of Andreas Ornithoparcus in 1609, originally printed in Leipzig in 1517, described as \"a rather stiff and medieval treatise, but nonetheless occasionally entertaining\".Warlock 1970, p.39\n\nVarietie of Lute-Lessons (1610)\n\nThe Varietie of Lute-Lessons  was published by Dowland's son, Robert Dowland, in 1610. It contains solo lute works by Dowland.\n\nMusicall Banquet (1611) \n\nA Musicall Banquet was published by Dowland's son, Robert Dowland, in 1610. It contains three songs by John Dowland.\n# Farre from triumphing Court\n# Lady if you so spight me\n# In darknesse let me dwell\n\nA Pilgrimes Solace (1612) \n\nDowland's last work A Pilgrimes Solace, was published in 1612,Warlock 1970, p.41 and seems to have been conceived more as a collection of contrapuntal music than as solo works.Abraham 1968, p.207\n\n# Disdaine me still, that I may euer loue\n# Sweete stay a while, why will you?\n# To aske for all thy loue\n# Loue those beames that breede\n# Shall I striue with wordes to moue\n# Were euery thought an eye\n# Stay time a while thy flying\n# Tell me true Loue\n# Goe nightly cares, the enemy to rest\n# From silent night, true register of moanes\n# Lasso vita mia, mi fa morire\n# In this trembling shadow\n# If that a Sinners sighes be Angels food\n# Thou mighty God\n# When Dauids life by Saul\n# When the poore Criple\n# Where Sinne sore wounding\n# My heart and tongue were twinnes\n# Vp merry Mates, to Neptunes praise\n# Welcome black night\n# Cease these false sports\n# A Galliard to Lachrimae\n\nUnpublished works \n\nMany of Dowland's works only survive in manuscript form.\n\nSuspicions of treason\n\nDowland performed a number of espionage assignments for Sir Robert Cecil in France and Denmark; despite his high rate of pay, Dowland seems to have been only a court musician. However, we have in his own words the fact that he was for a time embroiled in treasonous Catholic intrigue in Italy,Warlock 1970 – entire letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil\nwhither he had travelled in the hopes of meeting and studying with Luca Marenzio, a famed madrigal composer. Whatever his religion, however, he was still intensely loyal to the Queen, though he seems to have had something of a grudge against her for her remark that he, Dowland, \"was a man to serve any prince in the world, but [he] was an obstinate Papist.\"Warlock 1970, p.25 But in spite of this, and though the plotters offered him a large sum of money from the Pope, as well as safe passage for his wife and children to come to him from England,Warlock 1970, p.26 in the end he declined to have anything further to do with their plans and begged pardon from Sir Robert Cecil and from the Queen.Warlock 1970, p.26-7\n\nPrivate life\n\nJohn Dowland was married and had children, as referenced in his letter to Sir Robert Cecil.Warlock 1970, pp. 25, 26 However, he had long periods of separation from his family, as his wife stayed in England while he worked on the Continent.Gerald M. Cooper, \"John Dowland,\" The Musical Times, Vol. 68, No. 1013 (1 July 1927), p.642\n\nHis son Robert Dowland was also a musician, working for some time in the service of the first Earl of Devonshire, and taking over his father's position of lutenist at court when John died.Diana Poulton, \"John Dowland,\" The Musical Times Vol. 105 No. 1451 (January 1964): p. 25.\n\nDowland's melancholic lyrics and music have often been described as his attempts to develop an \"artistic persona\" though he was actually a cheerful person,Rooley 1983, p.6 but many of his own personal complaints, and the tone of bitterness in many of his comments, suggest that much of his music and his melancholy truly did come from his own personality and frustration.Diana Poulton, \"Dowland's Darkness,\" Early Music, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October 1983) p.519\n\nModern interpretations\n\nOne of the first 20th-century musicians who successfully helped reclaim Dowland from the history books was the singer-songwriter Frederick Keel.'Mr J Frederick Keel' (unsigned obituary). The Times, 16 August 1954, p 8. Keel included fifteen Dowland pieces in his two sets of Elizabethan love songs published in 1909 and 1913,Keel, Frederick (1909, 1913). Elizabethan love songs, sets I and II. London: Boosey & Hawkes. which achieved popularity in their day. These free arrangements for piano and low or high voice were intended to fit the tastes and musical practices associated with art songs of the time.\n\nIn 1935, Australian-born composer Percy Grainger, who also had a deep interest in music made before Bach, arranged Dowland's Now, O now I needs must part for piano. Some years later, in 1953, Grainger wrote a work titled Bell Piece (Ramble on John Dowland's 'Now, O now I needs must part'), which was a version scored for voice and wind band, based on his previously mentioned transcription.\n\nIn 1951 Alfred Deller, the famous counter-tenor (1912–1979), recorded songs by Dowland, Thomas Campion, and Philip Rosseter with the label HMV (His Master's Voice) HMV C.4178 and another HMV C.4236 of Dowland's \"Flow my Tears\". In 1977, Harmonia Mundi also published two records of Deller singing Dowland's Lute songs (HM 244&245-H244/246).[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/performers/deller.html Alfred Deller (1912–1979) – A discography]\n\nDowland's music became part of the repertoire of the early music revival with lutenist Julian Bream and tenor Peter Pears, and later with Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s and later with the Academy of Ancient Music from the early 1970s.\n\nJan Akkerman, guitarist of the Dutch progressive rock band Focus, recorded \"Tabernakel\" in 1973 (though released in 1974), an album of John Dowland songs and some original material, performed on lute.\n\nThe complete works of John Dowland were recorded by the Consort of Musicke, and released on the L'Oiseau Lyre label, though they recorded some of the songs as vocal consort music; the Third Book of Songs and A Pilgrim's Solace have yet to be recorded in their entirety as collections of solo songs.\n\nThe 1999 ECM New Series recording In Darkness Let Me Dwell features new interpretations of Dowland songs performed by tenor John Potter, lutenist Stephen Stubbs, and baroque violinist Maya Homburger in collaboration with English jazz musicians John Surman and Barry Guy.\n\nNigel North recorded Dowland's complete works for solo lute on four CDs between 2004 and 2007, on Naxos records.\n\nElvis Costello included a recording (with Fretwork and the Composers Ensemble) of Dowland's \"Can she excuse my wrongs\" as a bonus track on the 2006 re-release of his The Juliet Letters.\n\nIn October 2006, Sting, who says he has been fascinated by the music of John Dowland for 25 years,[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1791189,00.html Gift of a lute makes Sting party like it's 1599, June 6, 2006, The Guardian] released an album featuring Dowland's songs titled Songs from the Labyrinth, on Deutsche Grammophon, in collaboration with Edin Karamazov on lute and archlute. They described their treatment of Dowland's work in a Great Performances appearance. To give some idea of the tone and intrigues of life in late Elizabethan England, Sting also recites throughout the album portions of a 1593 letter written by Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil. The letter describes Dowland's travels to various points of Western Europe, then breaks into a detailed account of his activities in Italy, along with a heartfelt denial of the charges of treason whispered against him by unknown persons. Dowland most likely was suspected of this for travelling to the courts of various Catholic monarchs and accepting payment from them greater than what a musician of the time would normally have received for performing.\n\nScores\n\nThe Collected Lute Music of John Dowland, with lute tablature and keyboard notation, was transcribed and edited by Diana Poulton and Basil Lam, Faber Music Limited, London 1974.\n\nJohn Dowland: Complete Solo Galliards for Renaissance Lute or Guitar was transcribed and edited with performance suggestions, new divisions (or variations) and transposition for 6-stringed instruments by Ben Salfield, Peacock Press, UK, 2014.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* \"Flow My Tears\" and two other Dowland works from The Second Book of Songs are referenced in the Philip K.

He wrote a lute version of the popular ballad \"My Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home\".\n\nDowland's music often displays the melancholia that was so fashionable in music at that time.Anthony Rooley, \"New Light on John Dowland's Songs of Darkness,\" Early Music 11.1 (January 1983): p.6 He wrote a consort piece with the punning title \"Semper Dowland, semper dolens\" (always Dowland, always doleful), which may be said to sum up much of his work.http://www.goldbergweb.com/en/magazine/composers/2005/2/38613_print.php\n\nDowland's song, \"Come Heavy Sleepe, the Image of True Death\", was the inspiration for Benjamin Britten's Nocturnal after John Dowland, written in 1963 for the guitarist Julian Bream. This work consists of eight variations, all based on musical themes drawn from the song or its lute accompaniment, finally resolving into a guitar setting of the song itself.Smith 2002, p.289\n\nRichard Barnfield, Dowland's contemporary, refers to him in poem VIII of The Passionate Pilgrim (1598), a Shakespearean sonnet:\n\nPublished works\n\nThere is no complete catalogue of Dowland's works. The fullest list is that compiled by Diana Poulton in her The collected Lute Music of John Dowland. P numbers are therefore sometimes used to designate individual pieces.\n\nWhole Book of Psalms (1592) \n\nPublished by Thomas Est in 1592, The Whole Booke of Psalmes contained works by 10 composers, including 6 pieces by Dowland.\n# Put me not to rebuke, O Lord (Psalm 38)\n# All people that on earth do dwell (Psalm 100)\n# My soul praise the Lord (Psalm 104)\n# Lord to thee I make my moan (Psalm 130)\n# Behold and have regard (Psalm 134)\n# A Prayer for the Queens most excellent Maiestie\n\nNew Book of Tablature (1596) \n\nThe New Booke of Tabliture was published by William Barley in 1596. It contains seven solo lute pieces by Dowland.\n\nLamentatio Henrici Noel (1596) \n\nWritten for the professional choir of Westminster Abbey.[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/geistliches_e.html]\n# The Lamentation of a sinner\n# Domine ne in furore (Psalm 6)\n# Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51)\n# The humble sute of a sinner\n# The humble complaint of a sinner\n# De profundis (Psalm 130)\n# Domine exaudi (Psalm 143)\n\nOf uncertain attribution are:\n# Ye righteous in the Lord\n# An heart that's broken\n# I shame at my unworthiness\n\nFirst Book of Songs (1597) \n\nDowland published his The First Booke of Songes or Ayres in London in 1597.  It was one of the most influential and important musical publications of the history of the lute. This collection of lute-songs was set out in a way that allows performance by a soloist with lute accompaniment or various combinations of singers and instrumentalists.Gerald Abraham. ed. The New Oxford History of Music, Volume IV: The Age of Humanism 1540–1630 (London: Oxford University Press, 1968), p. 203\n\nThe 21 songs are:[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/first_e.html]\n# Vnquiet thoughts\n# Who euer thinks or hopes of loue for loue\n# My thoughts are wingd with hopes\n# If my complaints could passions moue\n# Can she excuse my wrongs with vertues cloake\n# Now, O now I needs must part\n# Deare if you change ile neuer chuse againe\n# Burst forth my teares\n# Go Cristall teares\n# Thinkst thou then by thy faining\n# Come away, come sweet loue\n# Rest awhile you cruell cares\n# Sleepe wayward thoughts\n# All ye whom loue of fortune hath betraide\n# Wilt though vnkind thus reaue me of my hart\n# Would my conceit that first enforst my woe\n# Come again: sweet loue doth now enuite\n# His goulden locks time hath to siluer turnd\n# Awake sweet loue thou art returned\n# Come heauy sleepe\n# Awaie with these selfe louing lads\n\nSecond Book of Songs (1600) \n\nDowland published The Second Booke of Songs or Ayres, in 1600.\n\nThe songs are:[http://hephoz.de/_kunden/dowland/second_e.html]\n# I saw my Lady weepe\n# Flow my teares fall from your springs\n# Sorow sorow stay, lend true repentant teares\n# Dye not before thy day\n# Mourne, mourne, day is with darknesse fled\n# Tymes eldest sonne, old age the heire of ease, First part\n# Then sit thee downe, and say thy Nunc demittis, Second Part\n# When others sings Venite exultemus, Third part\n# Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceipt\n# O sweet woods, the delight of solitarienesse\n# If fluds of teares could clense my follies past\n# Fine knacks for Ladies, cheap, choise, braue and new\n# Now cease my wandring eyes\n# Come ye heavie states of night\n# White as Lillies was hir face\n# Wofull heart with griefe oppressed\n# A Sheperd in a shade his plaining made\n# Faction that euer dwells in court\n# Shall I sue, shall I seeke for grace\n# Finding in fields my Siluia all alone (Toss not my soul)\n# Cleare or Cloudie sweet as Aprill showring\n# Humor say what makst thou heere\n# Dowland's Adieu for Master Oliver Cromwell\n\nThird Book of Songs (1603) \n\nThe Third and Last Booke of Songs or Aires was published in 1603.\n\nThe 21 songs are:\n# Farewell too faire\n# Time stands still\n# Behold the wonder heere\n# Daphne wast not so chaste as she was changing\n# Me me and none but me\n# When Phoebus first did Daphne loue\n# Say loue if euer thou didst finde\n# Flow not so fast ye fountaines\n# What if I neuer speede\n# Loue stood amaz'd at sweet beauties paine\n# Lend your eares to my sorrow good people\n# By a fountaine where I lay\n# Oh what hath ouerwrought my all amazed thought\n# Farewell vnkind farewell\n# Weepe you no more sad fountaines\n# Fie on this faining, is loue without desire\n# I must complaine, yet doe enioy\n# It was a time when silly Bees could speake\n# The lowest trees haue tops\n# What poore Astronomers are they\n# Come when I call, or tarrie till I come\n\nLachrimae (1604) \n\nThe Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares was published in 1604. It contains the seven pavans of Lachrimae itself and 14 others, including the famous Semper Dowland semper Dolens.\n# Lachrimae Antiquae\n# Lachrimae Antiquae Nouae\n# Lachrimae Gementes\n# Lachrimae Tristes\n# Lachrimae Coactae\n# Lachrimae Amantis\n# Lachrimae Verae\n# Semper Dowland semper Dolens (P.9)\n# Sir Henry Vmptons Funeral\n# M.

George Whitehead his Almand\n\nMicrologus (1609) \n\nDowland published  a translation of the Micrologus of Andreas Ornithoparcus in 1609, originally printed in Leipzig in 1517, described as \"a rather stiff and medieval treatise, but nonetheless occasionally entertaining\".Warlock 1970, p.39\n\nVarietie of Lute-Lessons (1610)\n\nThe Varietie of Lute-Lessons  was published by Dowland's son, Robert Dowland, in 1610. It contains solo lute works by Dowland.\n\nMusicall Banquet (1611) \n\nA Musicall Banquet was published by Dowland's son, Robert Dowland, in 1610. It contains three songs by John Dowland.\n# Farre from triumphing Court\n# Lady if you so spight me\n# In darknesse let me dwell\n\nA Pilgrimes Solace (1612) \n\nDowland's last work A Pilgrimes Solace, was published in 1612,Warlock 1970, p.41 and seems to have been conceived more as a collection of contrapuntal music than as solo works.Abraham 1968, p.207\n\n# Disdaine me still, that I may euer loue\n# Sweete stay a while, why will you?\n# To aske for all thy loue\n# Loue those beames that breede\n# Shall I striue with wordes to moue\n# Were euery thought an eye\n# Stay time a while thy flying\n# Tell me true Loue\n# Goe nightly cares, the enemy to rest\n# From silent night, true register of moanes\n# Lasso vita mia, mi fa morire\n# In this trembling shadow\n# If that a Sinners sighes be Angels food\n# Thou mighty God\n# When Dauids life by Saul\n# When the poore Criple\n# Where Sinne sore wounding\n# My heart and tongue were twinnes\n# Vp merry Mates, to Neptunes praise\n# Welcome black night\n# Cease these false sports\n# A Galliard to Lachrimae\n\nUnpublished works \n\nMany of Dowland's works only survive in manuscript form.\n\nSuspicions of treason\n\nDowland performed a number of espionage assignments for Sir Robert Cecil in France and Denmark; despite his high rate of pay, Dowland seems to have been only a court musician. However, we have in his own words the fact that he was for a time embroiled in treasonous Catholic intrigue in Italy,Warlock 1970 – entire letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil\nwhither he had travelled in the hopes of meeting and studying with Luca Marenzio, a famed madrigal composer. Whatever his religion, however, he was still intensely loyal to the Queen, though he seems to have had something of a grudge against her for her remark that he, Dowland, \"was a man to serve any prince in the world, but [he] was an obstinate Papist.\"Warlock 1970, p.25 But in spite of this, and though the plotters offered him a large sum of money from the Pope, as well as safe passage for his wife and children to come to him from England,Warlock 1970, p.26 in the end he declined to have anything further to do with their plans and begged pardon from Sir Robert Cecil and from the Queen.Warlock 1970, p.26-7\n\nPrivate life\n\nJohn Dowland was married and had children, as referenced in his letter to Sir Robert Cecil.Warlock 1970, pp. 25, 26 However, he had long periods of separation from his family, as his wife stayed in England while he worked on the Continent.Gerald M. Cooper, \"John Dowland,\" The Musical Times, Vol. 68, No. 1013 (1 July 1927), p.642\n\nHis son Robert Dowland was also a musician, working for some time in the service of the first Earl of Devonshire, and taking over his father's position of lutenist at court when John died.Diana Poulton, \"John Dowland,\" The Musical Times Vol. 105 No. 1451 (January 1964): p. 25.\n\nDowland's melancholic lyrics and music have often been described as his attempts to develop an \"artistic persona\" though he was actually a cheerful person,Rooley 1983, p.6 but many of his own personal complaints, and the tone of bitterness in many of his comments, suggest that much of his music and his melancholy truly did come from his own personality and frustration.Diana Poulton, \"Dowland's Darkness,\" Early Music, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October 1983) p.519\n\nModern interpretations\n\nOne of the first 20th-century musicians who successfully helped reclaim Dowland from the history books was the singer-songwriter Frederick Keel.'Mr J Frederick Keel' (unsigned obituary). The Times, 16 August 1954, p 8. Keel included fifteen Dowland pieces in his two sets of Elizabethan love songs published in 1909 and 1913,Keel, Frederick (1909, 1913). Elizabethan love songs, sets I and II. London: Boosey & Hawkes. which achieved popularity in their day. These free arrangements for piano and low or high voice were intended to fit the tastes and musical practices associated with art songs of the time.\n\nIn 1935, Australian-born composer Percy Grainger, who also had a deep interest in music made before Bach, arranged Dowland's Now, O now I needs must part for piano. Some years later, in 1953, Grainger wrote a work titled Bell Piece (Ramble on John Dowland's 'Now, O now I needs must part'), which was a version scored for voice and wind band, based on his previously mentioned transcription.\n\nIn 1951 Alfred Deller, the famous counter-tenor (1912–1979), recorded songs by Dowland, Thomas Campion, and Philip Rosseter with the label HMV (His Master's Voice) HMV C.4178 and another HMV C.4236 of Dowland's \"Flow my Tears\". In 1977, Harmonia Mundi also published two records of Deller singing Dowland's Lute songs (HM 244&245-H244/246).[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/performers/deller.html Alfred Deller (1912–1979) – A discography]\n\nDowland's music became part of the repertoire of the early music revival with lutenist Julian Bream and tenor Peter Pears, and later with Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s and later with the Academy of Ancient Music from the early 1970s.\n\nJan Akkerman, guitarist of the Dutch progressive rock band Focus, recorded \"Tabernakel\" in 1973 (though released in 1974), an album of John Dowland songs and some original material, performed on lute.\n\nThe complete works of John Dowland were recorded by the Consort of Musicke, and released on the L'Oiseau Lyre label, though they recorded some of the songs as vocal consort music; the Third Book of Songs and A Pilgrim's Solace have yet to be recorded in their entirety as collections of solo songs.\n\nThe 1999 ECM New Series recording In Darkness Let Me Dwell features new interpretations of Dowland songs performed by tenor John Potter, lutenist Stephen Stubbs, and baroque violinist Maya Homburger in collaboration with English jazz musicians John Surman and Barry Guy.\n\nNigel North recorded Dowland's complete works for solo lute on four CDs between 2004 and 2007, on Naxos records.\n\nElvis Costello included a recording (with Fretwork and the Composers Ensemble) of Dowland's \"Can she excuse my wrongs\" as a bonus track on the 2006 re-release of his The Juliet Letters.\n\nIn October 2006, Sting, who says he has been fascinated by the music of John Dowland for 25 years,[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1791189,00.html Gift of a lute makes Sting party like it's 1599, June 6, 2006, The Guardian] released an album featuring Dowland's songs titled Songs from the Labyrinth, on Deutsche Grammophon, in collaboration with Edin Karamazov on lute and archlute. They described their treatment of Dowland's work in a Great Performances appearance. To give some idea of the tone and intrigues of life in late Elizabethan England, Sting also recites throughout the album portions of a 1593 letter written by Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil. The letter describes Dowland's travels to various points of Western Europe, then breaks into a detailed account of his activities in Italy, along with a heartfelt denial of the charges of treason whispered against him by unknown persons. Dowland most likely was suspected of this for travelling to the courts of various Catholic monarchs and accepting payment from them greater than what a musician of the time would normally have received for performing.\n\nScores\n\nThe Collected Lute Music of John Dowland, with lute tablature and keyboard notation, was transcribed and edited by Diana Poulton and Basil Lam, Faber Music Limited, London 1974.\n\nJohn Dowland: Complete Solo Galliards for Renaissance Lute or Guitar was transcribed and edited with performance suggestions, new divisions (or variations) and transposition for 6-stringed instruments by Ben Salfield, Peacock Press, UK, 2014.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* \"Flow My Tears\" and two other Dowland works from The Second Book of Songs are referenced in the Philip K.
