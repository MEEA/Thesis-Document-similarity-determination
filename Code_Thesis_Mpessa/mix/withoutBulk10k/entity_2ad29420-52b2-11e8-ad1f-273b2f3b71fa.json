  "textBody" : "KISS is an acronym for \"Keep it simple, stupid\" as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson (1910–1990). The term \"KISS principle\" was in popular use by 1970. Variations on the phrase include: \"Keep it simple, silly\", \"keep it short and simple\", \"keep it simple and straightforward\", \"keep it small and simple\" and \"keep it stupid, simple\".\n\nOrigin\n\nThe acronym was reportedly coined by Kelly Johnson, lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works (creators of the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, among many others).\n\nWhile popular usage has transcribed it for decades as \"Keep it simple, stupid\", Johnson transcribed it as \"Keep it simple stupid\" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.Ram B. Misra (2004), \"Global IT Outsourcing: Metrics for Success of All Parties\", Journal of Information Technology Cases and Applications, volume 6 issue 3, page 21.

There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.\n\nThe principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the \"stupid\" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.\n\nThe acronym has been used by many in the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Navy and United States Air Force, and in the field of software development.\n\nVariants\n\nThe principle most likely finds its origins in similar minimalist concepts, such as Occam's razor, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\", Mies Van Der Rohe's \"Less is more\", Bjarne Stroustrup's \"Make Simple Tasks Simple!\", or Antoine de Saint Exupéry's \"It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away\". Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars, urged his designers to \"Simplify, then add lightness\".
