Zephaniah means \"Yahweh has hidden/protected,\" or \"Yahweh hides,\".\n\nAuthorship and date \n\nThe book's superscription attributes its authorship to \"Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah\" (1:1, NRSV). All that is known of Zephaniah comes from the text.\n\nThe name \"Cushi,\" Zephaniah's father, means \"Cushite\" or \"Ethiopian,\" and the text of Zephaniah mentions the sin and restoration of Ethiopians.,  While some have concluded from this that Zephaniah was a black Jew, Ehud Ben Zvi maintains that, based on the context, \"Cushi\" must be understood as a personal name rather than an indicator of nationality. Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the name Hezekiah in the superscription as King Hezekiah of Judah, though that is not a claim advanced in the text of Zephaniah.\n\nAs with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of King Josiah (640–609 BCE) before his reforms of 622 BCE took full effect, in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of Manasseh (698/687–642 BCE). Others agree that some portion of the book is postmonarchic, that is, dating to later than 586 BCE when the Kingdom of Judah fell in the Siege of Jerusalem. Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of Isaiah because of the two books' similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah.\n\nPurpose \n\nIf Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, then its composition was occasioned by Judah's refusal to obey its covenant obligations toward Yahweh despite having seen Israel's exile a generation or two previously—an exile that the Judahite literary tradition attributed to Yahweh's anger against Israel's disobedience to his covenant. In this historical context, Zephaniah urges Judah to obedience to Yahweh, saying that \"perhaps\" he will forgive them if they do.\n\nThemes \n\nThe HarperCollins Study Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:\n\nMore consistently than any other prophetic book, Zephaniah focuses on \"the day of the Lord,\" developing this tradition from its first appearance in Amos.
