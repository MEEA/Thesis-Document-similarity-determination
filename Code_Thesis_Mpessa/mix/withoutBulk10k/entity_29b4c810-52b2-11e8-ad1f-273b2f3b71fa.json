  "textBody" : "Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree of the order Malvales and the family Malvaceae (previously separated in the family Bombacaceae), native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, northern South America, and (as the variety C. pentandra var. guineensis) to tropical west Africa. A somewhat smaller variety is found throughout southern Asia and the East Indies. Kapok is the most used common name for the tree and may also refer to the cotton-like fluff obtained from its seed pods. The tree is cultivated for the seed fibre, particularly in south-east Asia, and is also known as the Java cotton, Java kapok, silk-cotton, samauma, or ceiba.\n\nCommon names\n\n*English – Kapok, ceiba, white silk-cotton tree\n*Haitian Creole – Mapou\n*Spanish – Ceiba, lupuna (Peru)\n*Portuguese – Sumaúma (Portugal), samaúma (Brazil), mafumeira (Brazil), ocá (São Tomé and Príncipe), poilão (Guinea-Bissau and Portugal).\n*French – Fromager\n*Surinamese – Kankantrie\n*Hindi – Safed semal सफ़ेद सेमल \n*Manipuri – মোৰেহ তেৰা Moreh tera \n*Malayalam – Pannimaram \n*Tamil – Ilavam இலவம்\n*Telugu – Tellaburaga \n*Tagalog/Filipino – Bulak or bulac\n*Marathi – Samali \n*Kannada – Dudi \n*Sanskrit – Kutashalmali \n*Bengali – শ্ৱেত সিমল Shwet simul\n*Assamese – শিমলু Simolu\n*Samoan – Vavae \n*Sinhala – Kotta\n*Ashante, Twi and Fanteen – Onyãã, or onyinaF.R.

It becomes rancid quickly when exposed to air. Kapok oil is produced in India, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Kapok oil has some potential as a biofuel and in paint preparation.\n\nReligion and folklore\n\nThe kapok is a sacred symbol in Maya mythology.\n\nAccording to the folklore of Trinidad and Tobago, the Castle of the Devil is a huge kapok growing deep in the forest in which Bazil the demon of death was imprisoned by a carpenter.
