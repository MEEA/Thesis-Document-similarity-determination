  "textBody" : "The group velocity of a wave is the velocity with which the overall shape of the waves' amplitudes—known as the modulation or envelope of the wave—propagates through space.\n\nFor example, if a stone is thrown into the middle of a very still pond, a circular pattern of waves with a quiescent center appears in the water, also known as a Capillary wave. The expanding ring of waves is the wave group, within which one can discern individual wavelets of differing wavelengths traveling at different speeds. The shorter waves travel faster than the group as a whole, but their amplitudes diminish as they approach the leading edge. The longer waves travel more slowly, and their amplitudes diminish as they emerge from the trailing boundary of the group.\n\nDefinition and interpretation \n\nDefinition \n\nThe group velocity  is defined by the equation:\nv_g \\ \\equiv\\  \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k}\\,\n\nwhere  is the wave's angular frequency (usually expressed in radians per second), and  is the angular wavenumber (usually expressed in radians per meter). The phase velocity is: .\n\nThe function , which gives  as a function of , is known as the dispersion relation.\n\n* If   is directly proportional to  , then the group velocity is exactly equal to the phase velocity. A wave of any shape will travel undistorted at this velocity.\n* If ω is a linear function of k, but not directly proportional , then the group velocity and phase velocity are different. The envelope of a wave packet (see figure on right) will travel at the group velocity, while the individual peaks and troughs within the envelope will move at the phase velocity.\n* If  is not a linear function of , the envelope of a wave packet will become distorted as it travels. Since a wave packet contains a range of different frequencies (and hence different values of ), the group velocity  will be different for different values of . Therefore, the envelope does not move at a single velocity, but its wavenumber components () move at different velocities, distorting the envelope. If the wavepacket has a narrow range of frequencies, and  is approximately linear over that narrow range, the pulse distortion will be small, in relation to the small nonlinearity. See further discussion below. For example, for deep water gravity waves, , and hence . This underlies the Kelvin wake pattern for the bow wave of all ships and swimming objects.  Regardless of how fast they are moving, as long as their velocity is constant, on each side the wake forms an angle of 19.47° = arcsin(1/3) with the line of travel.G.B. Whitham (1974). Linear and Nonlinear Waves (John Wiley & Sons Inc., 1974) pp 409–410 [https://archive.org/details/LinearAndNonlinearWaves Online scan]            \n\nDerivation\n\nOne derivation of the formula for group velocity is as follows.\n\nConsider a wave packet as a function of position  and time .\n\nLet  be its Fourier transform at time ,\n \\alpha(x, 0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dk \\, A(k) e^{ikx}.\n\nBy the superposition principle, the wavepacket at any time   is\n \\alpha(x, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dk \\, A(k) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)},\nwhere   is implicitly a function of  .\n\nAssume that the wave packet   is almost monochromatic, so that   is sharply peaked around a central wavenumber  .\n\nThen, linearization gives\n\\omega(k) \\approx \\omega_0 + \\left(k - k_0\\right)\\omega'_0\nwhere \n\\omega_0 \\omega(k_0) and \\omega'_0 \n \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\omega(k)}{\\partial k}\\right|_{k=k_0} \n(see next section for discussion of this step). Then, after some algebra,\n \\alpha(x,t) = e^{i\\left(k_0 x - \\omega_0 t\\right)}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dk \\, A(k) e^{i(k - k_0)\\left(x - \\omega'_0 t\\right)}.\n\nThere are two factors in this expression. The first factor, e^{i\\left(k_0 x - \\omega_0 t\\right)}, describes a perfect monochromatic wave with wavevector  , with peaks and troughs moving at the phase velocity \\omega_0/k_0  within the envelope of the wavepacket.\n\nThe other factor, \n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dk \\, A(k) e^{i(k - k_0)\\left(x - \\omega'_0 t\\right)}, \ngives the envelope of the wavepacket. This envelope function depends on position and time only through the combination (x - \\omega'_0 t).\n\nTherefore, the envelope of the wavepacket travels at velocity \n\\omega'_0 \\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{dk}\\right|_{k\nk_0}~, \nwhich explains the group velocity formula.\n\nHigher-order terms in dispersion\n\nPart of the previous derivation is the Taylor series approximation that:\n\\omega(k) \\approx \\omega_0 + (k - k_0)\\omega'_0(k_0)\n\nIf the wavepacket has a relatively large frequency spread, or if the dispersion  has sharp variations (such as due to a resonance), or if the packet travels over very long distances, this assumption is not valid, and higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion become important.\n\nAs a result, the envelope of the wave packet not only moves, but also distorts, in a manner that can be described by the material's group velocity dispersion. Loosely speaking, different frequency-components of the wavepacket travel at different speeds, with the faster components moving towards the front of the wavepacket and the slower moving towards the back. Eventually, the wave packet gets stretched out. This is an important effect in the propagation of signals through optical fibers and in the design of high-power, short-pulse lasers.\n\nHistory \n\nThe idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave's phase velocity was first proposed by W.R. Hamilton in 1839, and the first full treatment was by Rayleigh in his \"Theory of Sound\" in 1877.\n\nOther expressions \n\nFor light, the refractive index , vacuum wavelength  , and wavelength in the medium  , are related by\n\\lambda_0 \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega}, \\;\\; \\lambda \n \\frac{2\\pi}{k} \\frac{2\\pi v_p}{\\omega}, \\;\\; n \n \\frac{c}{v_p} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda},\nwith   the phase velocity.\n\nThe group velocity, therefore, can be calculated by any of the following formulas,\n \\begin{align}\n  v_g &= \\frac{c}{n + \\omega \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\omega}}\n       = \\frac{c}{n - \\lambda_0 \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\lambda_0}}\\\\\n      &= v_p \\left(1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\lambda}\\right)\n       v_p - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial v_p}{\\partial \\lambda} \n v_p + k \\frac{\\partial v_p}{\\partial k}.\n\\end{align}\n\nIn three dimensions\n\nFor waves traveling through three dimensions, such as light waves, sound waves, and matter waves, the formulas for phase and group velocity are generalized in a straightforward way:[https://books.google.com/books?idcC0Kye7nHEEC&pg\nPA239 Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics: fundamentals and large-scale circulation, by Geoffrey K. Vallis, p239]\nOne dimension: v_p \\omega/k, \\quad v_g \n \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k}, \\,\nThree dimensions: \\mathbf{v}_p \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{\\omega}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_g \n \\vec{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{k}} \\, \\omega \\,\nwhere \n\\vec{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{k}} \\, \\omega \nmeans the gradient of the angular frequency     as a function of the wave vector \\mathbf{k}, and \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} is the unit vector in direction k.\n\nIf the waves are propagating through an anisotropic (i.e., not rotationally symmetric) medium, for example a crystal, then the phase velocity vector and group velocity vector may point in different directions.\n\nIn lossy or gainful media \n\nThe group velocity is often thought of as the velocity at which energy or information is conveyed along a wave. In most cases this is accurate, and the group velocity can be thought of as the signal velocity of the waveform. However, if the wave is travelling through an absorptive or gainful medium, this does not always hold. In these cases the group velocity may not be a well-defined quantity, or may not be a meaningful quantity.\n\nIn his text “Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures”, Brillouin argued that in a dissipative medium the group velocity ceases to have a clear physical meaning. An example concerning the transmission of electromagnetic waves through an atomic gas is given by Loudon. Another example is mechanical waves in the solar photosphere: The waves are damped (by radiative heat flow from the peaks to the troughs), and related to that, the energy velocity is often substantially lower than the waves' group velocity.\n\nDespite this ambiguity, a common way to extend the concept of group velocity to complex media is to consider spatially damped plane wave solutions inside the medium, which are characterized by a complex-valued wavevector. Then, the imaginary part of the wavevector is arbitrarily discarded and the usual formula for group velocity is applied to the real part of wavevector, i.e.,\nv_g = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\operatorname{Re} k)}{\\partial \\omega}\\right)^{-1} .\n\nOr, equivalently, in terms of the real part of complex refractive index,  , one has\n\\frac{c}{v_g} = n + \\omega \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\omega} .\n\nIt can be shown that this generalization of group velocity continues to be related to the apparent speed of the peak of a wavepacket. The above definition is not universal, however: alternatively one may consider the time damping of standing waves (real , complex ), or, allow group velocity to be a complex-valued quantity. Different considerations yield distinct velocities, yet all definitions agree for the case of a lossless, gainless medium.\n\nThe above generalization of group velocity for complex media can behave strangely, and the example of anomalous dispersion serves as a good illustration.\nAt the edges of a region of anomalous dispersion, v_g becomes infinite (surpassing even the speed of light in vacuum), and v_g may easily become negative \n(its sign opposes Re) inside the band of anomalous dispersion.\n\nSuperluminal group velocities \n\nSince the 1980s, various experiments have verified that it is possible for the group velocity (as defined above) of laser light pulses sent through lossy materials, or gainful materials, to significantly exceed the speed of light in vacuum . The peaks of wavepackets were also seen to move faster than .\n\nIn all these cases, however, there is no possibility that signals could be carried faster than the speed of light in vacuum, since the high value of  does not help to speed up the true motion of the sharp wavefront that would occur at the start of any real signal.",
