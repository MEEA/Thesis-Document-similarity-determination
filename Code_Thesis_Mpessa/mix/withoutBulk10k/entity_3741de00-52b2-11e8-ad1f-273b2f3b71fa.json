  "textBody" : "A municipality is usually a single urban or administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets.\n\nThe term municipality may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district.\n\nThe term is derived from French municipalité and Latin municipalis. The English word municipality derives from the Latin social contract municipium (derived from a word meaning \"duty holders\"), referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).\n\nA municipality can be any political jurisdiction from a sovereign state, such as the Principality of Monaco, to a small village, such as West Hampton Dunes, New York.\n\nThe territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass\n* only one populated place such as a city, town, or village\n* several of such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the U.S. state of New Jersey (1798–1899) as townships governing several villages, Municipalities of Mexico)\n* only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.\n\nPolitical powers\n\nPowers of municipalities range from virtual autonomy to complete subordination to the state. Municipalities may have the right to tax individuals and corporations with income tax, property tax, and corporate income tax, but may also receive substantial funding from the state.\n\nIn various countries\n\nIn various countries, municipalities are usually referred to as \"\", notably in Romance languages (derived from Latin) such as French ' (France, French-speaking areas of Belgium and Switzerland, French-speaking countries of Africa, e.g. Benin), Italian ', Romanian ', and Spanish ' (Chile), and in Germanic languages such as German ' (in political parlance, the official term being '), Swedish ', Faroese ', and Norwegian, Danish '. However, in Moldova and Romania exists both municipalities (municipiu; urban administrative units) and communes (comună; rural units), and a commune may be part of a municipality (see more: communes of Moldova, communes of Romania).\n\nSimilar terms include Spanish ', also called ' (cognate to \"municipality\"), Polish ', Dutch/Flemish ' and Luxembourgish '.\n\nEnglish-speaking\n\n*In Australia, the term local government area (LGA) is used in place of the generic municipality.

Types of municipalities within Canada include cities, district municipalities, municipal districts, municipalities, parishes, rural municipalities, towns, townships, villages, and villes among others. The Province of Ontario has different tiers of municipalities, including lower, upper, and single tiers. Types of upper tier municipalities in Ontario include counties and regional municipalities. Nova Scotia also has regional municipalities, which include cities, counties, districts, or towns as municipal units.\n*In India, a Municipality or Nagar Palika  is an urban local body that administers a city of population 100,000 or more.
