  "textBody" : "John Winslow Irving (born John Wallace Blunt Jr. on March 2, 1942) is an American novelist and screenwriter.\n\nIrving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of The World According to Garp in 1978. Many of Irving's novels, including The Cider House Rules (1985), A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), and A Widow for One Year (1998) have been bestsellers. Moreover, he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in the 72nd Academy Awards (1999) for his script of The Cider House Rules.[http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/072-22/ \"John Irving 1999 Acceptance Speech on Winning the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay\"], oscars.org\n\nFive of his novels have been adapted into films (Garp, Hotel, Meany, Cider, Widow). Several of Irving's books (Garp, Meany, Widow) and short stories have been set in and around Phillips Exeter Academy in the town of Exeter, New Hampshire.\n\nEarly life\n\nIrving was born John Wallace Blunt, Jr. in Exeter, New Hampshire, the son of Helen Frances (née Winslow) and John Wallace Blunt, Sr., a writer and executive recruiter;[http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Irving__John.html Pabook.libraries.psu.edu][http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/london%20sunday%20times/904G-000-014.html Maryellenmark.com] but the couple separated during pregnancy.  Irving grew up in Exeter with a stepfather who was a Phillips Exeter Academy faculty member. His name was Colin Franklin Newell Irving. His uncle, Hammy Bissell, was also part of the faculty. John Irving was in the Phillips Exeter wrestling program as a student athlete and as an assistant coach, and wrestling features prominently in his books, stories, and life.\n\nIrving's biological father, whom he never met, had been a pilot in the Army Air Forces and, during World War II, was shot down over Burma in July 1943, but somehow survived. (The incident was incorporated into his novel The Cider House Rules.) Irving did not find out about his father's heroism until 1981, when he was almost 40 years old.\n\nCareer\n\nIrving's career began at the age of 26 with the publication of his first novel, Setting Free the Bears (1968). The novel was reasonably well reviewed but failed to gain a large readership. In the late 1960s, he studied with Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. His second and third novels, The Water-Method Man (1972) and The 158-Pound Marriage (1974), were similarly received. In 1975, Irving accepted a position as assistant professor of English at Mount Holyoke College.\n\nFrustrated at the lack of promotion his novels were receiving from his first publisher, Random House, Irving offered his fourth novel, The World According to Garp (1978), to Dutton, which promised him stronger commitment to marketing. The novel became an international bestseller and cultural phenomenon. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979 (eventually going to Tim O'Brien for Going After Cacciato)[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1979.html \"National Book Awards – 1979\"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved March 14, 2012. and its first paperback edition won the Award next year.[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1980.html \"National Book Awards – 1980\"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-14. (With essays by Deb Caletti and Craig Nova from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.Garp won the 1980 award for paperback general Fiction. From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Awards history there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and multiple fiction categories, especially in 1980. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one. Garp was later made into a film directed by George Roy Hill and starring Robin Williams in the title role and Glenn Close as his mother; it garnered several Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Close and John Lithgow. Irving makes a brief cameo in the film as an official in one of Garp's high school wrestling matches.\n The World According to Garp was among three books recommended to the Pulitzer Advisory Board for consideration for the 1979 Award in Fiction in the Pulitzer Jury Committee report, although the award was given to The Stories of John Cheever (1978).Heinz-D. and Erika J. Fischer, The Pulitzer Prize Archive: Vol 21:  Chronicles of the Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, K G Saur Munchen 2007, page 346\n\nGarp transformed Irving from an obscure, academic literary writer to a household name, and his subsequent books were bestsellers. The next was The Hotel New Hampshire (1981), which sold well despite mixed reviews from critics. Like Garp, the novel was quickly made into a film, this time directed by Tony Richardson and starring Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, and Beau Bridges. \"Interior Space\", a short story originally published in Fiction magazine in 1980, later appeared in the 1981 O. Henry Prize Stories collection.\n\nIn 1985, Irving published The Cider House Rules. An epic set in a Maine orphanage, the novel's central topic is abortion. Many drew parallels between the novel and Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (1838). Irving's next novel was A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), another New England family epic about religion set in a New England boarding school and in Toronto, Ontario. The novel was influenced by The Tin Drum (1959) by Günter Grass,See e.g., Irving's NYT article [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Irving.html A Soldier Once] about Grass' autobiograpFhy Peeling the Onion, July 8, 2007. and the plot contains further allusions to The Scarlet Letter (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne and the works of Dickens. In Owen Meany, Irving for the first time examined the consequences of the Vietnam War—particularly mandatory conscription, which Irving avoided because he was a married father when of age for the draft. Owen Meany became Irving's best selling book since Garp.\n\nIrving returned to Random House for his next book, A Son of the Circus (1995). Arguably his most complicated and difficult book, and a departure from many of the themes and location settings in his previous novels, it was dismissed by critics but became a national bestseller on the strength of Irving's reputation for fashioning literate, engrossing page-turners. Irving returned in 1998 with A Widow for One Year, which was named a New York Times Notable Book.\n\nIn 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film directed by Lasse Hallström, starring Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, and Delroy Lindo. Irving also made a cameo appearance as the disapproving stationmaster. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nSoon afterward, Irving wrote My Movie Business, a memoir about his involvement in creating the film version of The Cider House Rules. After its publication in 1999, Irving appeared on the CBC Television program Hot Type to promote the book. During the interview, Irving criticized bestselling American author Tom Wolfe, saying Wolfe \"can't write\", and that Wolfe's writing makes Irving gag. Wolfe appeared on Hot Type later that year, calling Irving, Norman Mailer, and John Updike his \"three stooges\" who were panicked by his newest novel, A Man in Full (1998).\n\nIrving's 10th book, The Fourth Hand (2001), also became a bestseller. In 2004, A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound, a children's picture book originally included in A Widow for One Year, was published with illustrations by Tatjana Hauptmann. Irving's 11th novel, Until I Find You, was released on July 12, 2005.\n\nOn June 28, 2005, The New York Times published an article revealing that Until I Find You (2005) contains two specifically personal elements about his life that he had never before discussed publicly: his sexual abuse at age 11 by an older woman, and the recent entrance in his life of his biological father's family.\n\nIn his 12th novel, Last Night in Twisted River, published in 2009, Irving's central character is a novelist with, as critic Boyd Tonkin puts it, \"a career that teasingly follows Irving's own\".\n\nIrving has had four novels reach number one on the bestseller list of The New York Times: The Hotel New Hampshire (September 27, 1981), which stayed number one for seven weeks, and was in the top 15 for over 27 weeks; The Cider House Rules (June 16, 1985); A Widow for One Year (June 14, 1998); and The Fourth Hand (July 29, 2001).\n\nOther projects\n\nSince the publication of Garp made him independently wealthy, Irving has sporadically accepted short-term teaching positions (including one at his alma mater, the Iowa Writers' Workshop) and served as an assistant coach on his sons' high school wrestling teams. (Irving was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an \"Outstanding American\" in 1992.) In addition to his novels, he has also published Trying to Save Piggy Sneed (1996), a collection of his writings including a brief memoir and unpublished short fiction, My Movie Business, an account of the protracted process of bringing The Cider House Rules to the big screen, and The Imaginary Girlfriend, a short memoir focusing on writing and wrestling. In 2010, Irving revealed that he and Tod \"Kip\" Williams, director and writer of The Door in the Floor (2004), were co-writing a screenplay for an adaptation of A Widow for One Year (1998).\n\nRecent\n\nIn recent years, his four most highly regarded novels, The World According to Garp, The Cider House Rules, A Prayer for Owen Meany, and A Widow for One Year, have been published in Modern Library editions. Owen Meany was adapted into the 1998 film Simon Birch (Irving required that the title and character names be changed because the screenplay's story was \"markedly different\" from that of the novel; Irving is on record as having enjoyed the film, however). In 2004, a portion of A Widow for One Year was adapted into The Door in the Floor, starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger.\n\nIn a New York Magazine interview in 2009, Irving stated that he had begun work on a new novel, his 13th, based in part on a speech from Shakespeare's Richard II. Simon & Schuster published the novel, titled In One Person (2012), taking over from Random House. In One Person has a first-person viewpoint, Irving's first such narrative since A Prayer for Owen Meany (Irving decided to change the first-person narrative of Until I Find You to third person less than a year before publication). In One Person features a 60-year-old, bisexual protagonist named William, looking back on his life in the 1950s and '60s. The novel shares a similar theme and concern with The World According to Garp, which was Irving says, in part about \"people who hate you for your sexual differences.\"\n\nHe won a Lambda Literary Award in 2013 in the Bisexual Fiction category for In One Person, and was also awarded the organization's Bridge Builder Award to honor him as an ally of the LGBT community.[http://lgbtweekly.com/2013/06/04/25th-annual-lambda-literary-award-winners-announced/ \"25th annual Lambda Literary Award winners announced\"]. LGBT Weekly, June 4, 2013.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, Irving announced his next novel, his 14th, titled Avenue of Mysteries, named after a street in Mexico City.\n In an interview the previous year, he had revealed the last line of the book: \"Not every collision course comes as a surprise.\"[http://www.nsnews.com/entertainment/books/Author+makes+rare+Canadian+stop+tour/6676941/story.html John Irving visits Cap U as part of tour for new novel In One Person]\n\nOn December 19, 2014, John Irving posted a message on the Facebook page devoted to him and his work that he had \"finished 'Avenue of Mysteries.' It is a shorter novel for me, comparable in length to 'In One Person.'\" Irving speculated that \"if everything remains on schedule, the English-language editions should be published in fall 2015.\" Simon & Schuster published the book in November, 2015.\n\nThe dust jacket copy for \"Avenue of Mysteries\" describes Mr. Irving's novel in this manner: John Irving returns to the themes that established him as one of our most admired and beloved authors in this absorbing novel of fate and memory.In Avenue of Mysteries, Juan Diego—a fourteen-year-old boy, who was born and grew up in Mexico—has a thirteen-year-old sister. Her name is Lupe, and she thinks she sees what's coming—specifically, her own future and her brother's. Lupe is a mind reader; she doesn't know what everyone is thinking, but she knows what most people are thinking. Regarding what has happened, as opposed to what will,Lupe is usually right about the past; without your telling her, she knows all the worst things that have happened to you.Lupe doesn't know the future as accurately. But consider what a terrible burden it is, if you believe you know the future—especially your own future, or, even worse, the future of someone you love. What might a thirteen-year-old girl be driven to do, if she thought she could change the future?As an older man, Juan Diego will take a trip to the Philippines, but what travels with him are his dreams and memories; he is most alive in his childhood and early adolescence in Mexico. As we grow older—most of all, in what we remember and what we dream—we live in the past. Sometimes, we live more vividly in the past than in the present.Avenue of Mysteries is the story of what happens to Juan Diego in the Philippines, where what happened to him in the past—in Mexico—collides with his future.On November 3, 2015, Irving revealed that he'd been approached by HBO and Warner Brothers to reconstruct The World According to Garp as a miniseries. He described the project as being in the early stages.\n\nAccording to the byline of a self-penned, February 20, 2017 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, John Irving completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on The World According to Garp, and he is currently working on his fifteenth novel.\n\nOn June 28, 2017, John Irving revealed in a long letter to fans on Facebook that his new novel will be, primarily, a ghost story. \"...I have a history of being interested in ghosts. And here come the ghosts again. In my new novel, my fifteenth, the ghosts are more prominent than before; the novel begins and ends with them. Like A Widow for One Year, this novel is constructed as a play in three acts. I'm calling Act I 'Early Signs.' I began writing it on New Year's Eve—not a bad night to start a ghost story.\"\n\nOn August 1, 2017, an update about John Irving's fifteenth, in-progress, novel, was posted to his Facebook page: \"It's been 45 years since John Irving published The Water-Method Man. While his second novel is regarded as a purely comic tale, and John's current project is a darker contemplation of life's disruptive forces, the two novels bear some resemblance to one another. John Irving is once again experimenting with framed narratives and writing about the evolution of a writer—like Bogus Trumper, one who writes screenplays. This time, we see the main character—Adam Brewster—mature, from childhood and early adolescence, to become a writer like Garp, or Ruth Cole, or Juan Diego, as if writing were an inevitability given the fateful circumstances of his life. And, along the way, despite the darkness, there are points of humor. John's work in progress may ultimately be his funniest novel since The Water-Method Man.\"\n\nIn an interview with Mike Kilen for The Des Moines Register, published on October 26, 2017, John Irving revealed that the title of his new novel-in-progress is Darkness As a Bride. The title comes from lines in Shakespeare's play, Measure for Measure: \"If I must die, / I will encounter darkness as a bride, / and hug it in mine arms.\"\n\nBibliography \n\n* Setting Free the Bears (1968)\n* The Water-Method Man (1972)\n* The 158-Pound Marriage (1974)\n* The World According to Garp (1978)\n* The Hotel New Hampshire (1981)\n* The Cider House Rules (1985)\n* A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989)\n* A Son of the Circus (1994)\n* The Imaginary Girlfriend (non-fiction, 1995)\n* Trying to Save Piggy Sneed (collection, 1996)\n* A Widow for One Year (1998)\n* My Movie Business (non-fiction, 1999)\n* The Cider House Rules: A Screenplay (1999)\n* The Fourth Hand (2001)\n* A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound (2004)\n* Until I Find You (2005)\n* Last Night in Twisted River (2009)\n* In One Person (2012)\n* Avenue of Mysteries (2015)\n* Darkness As a Bride (forthcoming)\n\nFilmography based on Irving's writings \n\n* The World According to Garp (1982) \n* The Hotel New Hampshire (1984)\n* Simon Birch (1998) (partly based on A Prayer for Owen Meany)\n* The Cider House Rules (1999)\n* The Door in the Floor (2004) (from A Widow for One Year)\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1964, Irving married Shyla Leary, whom he had met at Harvard in 1963 while taking a summer course in German, before traveling to Vienna, Austria with IES Abroad. They have two sons, Colin and Brendan. The couple divorced in the early 1980s. In 1987, he married Janet Turnbull, who had been his publisher at Bantam-Seal Books and is now one of his literary agents. They have a son, Everett. Irving has homes in Vermont, Toronto, and Pointe au Baril.\n\nIrving was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007 and subsequently had a radical prostatectomy.\n\nIn 2010, Irving confirmed that he is a second cousin of Amy Bishop, a former assistant professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who is serving a life sentence for shooting six colleagues, killing three, during a department meeting on February 12, 2010.",

Lupe is a mind reader; she doesn't know what everyone is thinking, but she knows what most people are thinking. Regarding what has happened, as opposed to what will,Lupe is usually right about the past; without your telling her, she knows all the worst things that have happened to you.Lupe doesn't know the future as accurately. But consider what a terrible burden it is, if you believe you know the future—especially your own future, or, even worse, the future of someone you love. What might a thirteen-year-old girl be driven to do, if she thought she could change the future?As an older man, Juan Diego will take a trip to the Philippines, but what travels with him are his dreams and memories; he is most alive in his childhood and early adolescence in Mexico. As we grow older—most of all, in what we remember and what we dream—we live in the past. Sometimes, we live more vividly in the past than in the present.Avenue of Mysteries is the story of what happens to Juan Diego in the Philippines, where what happened to him in the past—in Mexico—collides with his future.On November 3, 2015, Irving revealed that he'd been approached by HBO and Warner Brothers to reconstruct The World According to Garp as a miniseries. He described the project as being in the early stages.\n\nAccording to the byline of a self-penned, February 20, 2017 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, John Irving completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on The World According to Garp, and he is currently working on his fifteenth novel.\n\nOn June 28, 2017, John Irving revealed in a long letter to fans on Facebook that his new novel will be, primarily, a ghost story. \"...I have a history of being interested in ghosts. And here come the ghosts again. In my new novel, my fifteenth, the ghosts are more prominent than before; the novel begins and ends with them. Like A Widow for One Year, this novel is constructed as a play in three acts. I'm calling Act I 'Early Signs.' I began writing it on New Year's Eve—not a bad night to start a ghost story.\"\n\nOn August 1, 2017, an update about John Irving's fifteenth, in-progress, novel, was posted to his Facebook page: \"It's been 45 years since John Irving published The Water-Method Man. While his second novel is regarded as a purely comic tale, and John's current project is a darker contemplation of life's disruptive forces, the two novels bear some resemblance to one another. John Irving is once again experimenting with framed narratives and writing about the evolution of a writer—like Bogus Trumper, one who writes screenplays. This time, we see the main character—Adam Brewster—mature, from childhood and early adolescence, to become a writer like Garp, or Ruth Cole, or Juan Diego, as if writing were an inevitability given the fateful circumstances of his life. And, along the way, despite the darkness, there are points of humor. John's work in progress may ultimately be his funniest novel since The Water-Method Man.\"\n\nIn an interview with Mike Kilen for The Des Moines Register, published on October 26, 2017, John Irving revealed that the title of his new novel-in-progress is Darkness As a Bride. The title comes from lines in Shakespeare's play, Measure for Measure: \"If I must die, / I will encounter darkness as a bride, / and hug it in mine arms.\"\n\nBibliography \n\n* Setting Free the Bears (1968)\n* The Water-Method Man (1972)\n* The 158-Pound Marriage (1974)\n* The World According to Garp (1978)\n* The Hotel New Hampshire (1981)\n* The Cider House Rules (1985)\n* A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989)\n* A Son of the Circus (1994)\n* The Imaginary Girlfriend (non-fiction, 1995)\n* Trying to Save Piggy Sneed (collection, 1996)\n* A Widow for One Year (1998)\n* My Movie Business (non-fiction, 1999)\n* The Cider House Rules: A Screenplay (1999)\n* The Fourth Hand (2001)\n* A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound (2004)\n* Until I Find You (2005)\n* Last Night in Twisted River (2009)\n* In One Person (2012)\n* Avenue of Mysteries (2015)\n* Darkness As a Bride (forthcoming)\n\nFilmography based on Irving's writings \n\n* The World According to Garp (1982) \n* The Hotel New Hampshire (1984)\n* Simon Birch (1998) (partly based on A Prayer for Owen Meany)\n* The Cider House Rules (1999)\n* The Door in the Floor (2004) (from A Widow for One Year)\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1964, Irving married Shyla Leary, whom he had met at Harvard in 1963 while taking a summer course in German, before traveling to Vienna, Austria with IES Abroad.
