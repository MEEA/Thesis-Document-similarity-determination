  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a field  is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as when they are applied to rational and real numbers. \nA field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of rational numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also in many areas of science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Évariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\nDefinition \n\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation written as , and a multiplication operation written as , both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers, including the existence of an additive inverse  for all elements a, and of a multiplicative inverse b−1 for every nonzero element b. This allows us to consider also the so-called inverse operations of subtraction , and division , via defining:\n,\n.\n\nClassic definition\n\nFormally, a field is a set  together with two operations called addition and multiplication. An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of  and  is called the sum of  and  and denoted . Similarly, the result of the multiplication of  and  is called the product of  and , and denoted  or . These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as field axioms. In the following definitions,   and  are arbitrary elements of the field .\n\n* Associativity of addition and multiplication:   and  .\n* Commutativity of addition and multiplication:  and .\n* Additive and multiplicative identity: there exist two different elements  and  in  such that  and .\n* Additive inverses: for every  in , there exists an element in , denoted , called additive inverse of a, such that .\n* Multiplicative inverses: for every  in , there exists an element in , denoted by , ,  or , called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that .\n* Distributivity of multiplication over addition:  .\n\nAlternative definitions\n\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants  and ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. This approach avoids existential quantifiers, which is important in constructive mathematics and computing.. See also Heyting field.\n\nExamples\n\nRational numbers\n\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers which can be written as fractions\n, where  and  are integers, and . The additive inverse of such a fraction is , and the multiplicative inverse (provided that ) is , which can be seen as follows:\n\n \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  \\frac{ba}{ab} \n 1.\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n{} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) \n \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n{} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} \n \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n\nReal and complex numbers\n\nThe real numbers , with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The complex numbers  consist of expressions\nwhere  is the imaginary unit, i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying .\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that all field axioms hold for . For example, the distributive law enforces\n, which equals .\nThe complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the plane, and addition resp. multiplication of such numbers then corresponds to adding resp. rotating and scaling points. The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\nConstructible numbers\n\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of constructible numbers. Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field  of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within .\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that \\sqrt[3] 2 is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\nA field with four elements\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called , , , and . The notation is chosen such that  plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n, which equals , as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a finite field with four elements, and is denoted  or . The subset consisting of  and  (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the binary field  or . In the context of computer science and Boolean algebra,  and  are often denoted respectively by false and true, the addition is then denoted XOR (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted AND. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with bits.\n\nElementary notions\n\nIn this section,  denotes an arbitrary field and  and  are arbitrary elements of .\n\nConsequences of the definition\n\nOne has  and . In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows .\n\nIf  then  or  must be 0. Indeed, if a ≠ 0, then \n. This means that every field is an integral domain.\n\nThe additive and the multiplicative group of a field\n\nThe axioms of a field  imply that it is an abelian group under addition. This group is called the additive group of the field, and is sometimes denoted by  when denoting it simply as  could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the nonzero elements of  form an abelian group under multiplication, called the multiplicative group, and denoted by  or just } or . \n\nA field may thus be defined as set  equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that  is a group under addition, } is a group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is distributive over addition.Equivalently, a field is an algebraic structure  of type , such that  is not defined,  and \n are abelian groups, and \n· is distributive over +.  Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses  and  are uniquely determined by .\n\nThe requirement  follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0. Thus, the trivial ring, consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic (see ).\n\nCharacteristic\n\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of F, it is possible to define the product  of an arbitrary element  of  by a positive integer  to be the -fold sum\n(which is an element of  .)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n,\nthen  is said to have characteristic 0. For example,  has characteristic 0 since no positive integer  is zero. Otherwise, if there is a positive integer  satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number. It is usually denoted by  and the field is said to have characteristic  then.\nFor example, the field  has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) .\n\nIf  has characteristic , then  for all  in . This implies that \n,\nsince all other binomial coefficients appearing in the binomial formula are divisible by . Here,  ( factors) is the -th power, i.e., the -fold product of the element . Therefore, the Frobenius map\nis compatible with the addition in  (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism. The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic  quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\nSubfields and prime fields\n\nA subfield  of a field  is a subset of  that is a field with respect to the field operations of . Equivalently  is a subset of  that contains , and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that , that for all  both  and  are in , and that for all  in , both  and  are in .\n\nField homomorphisms are maps  between two fields such that , , and , where  and  are arbitrary elements of . All field homomorphisms are injective. If  is also surjective, it is called an isomorphism (or the fields  and  are called isomorphic).\n\nA field is called a prime field if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field  contains a prime field. If the characteristic of  is  (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field  introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to .\n\nFinite fields\n\nFinite fields (also called Galois fields) are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example  is a field with four elements. Its subfield  is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.\n\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic. For a fixed positive integer , arithmetic \"modulo \" means to work with the numbers\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set  of integers, dividing by  and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if  is a prime number. For example, taking the prime  results in the above-mentioned field . For  and more generally, for any composite number (i.e., any number  which can be expressed as a product  of two strictly smaller natural numbers),  is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since  in , which, as was explained above, prevents  from being a field. The field  with  elements ( being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  .\n\nEvery finite field  has  elements, where  is prime and . This statement holds since  may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field. The dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite, say , which implies the asserted statement.\n\nA field with  elements can be constructed as the splitting field of the polynomial \n.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of  in which the polynomial  has  zeros. This means  has as many zeros as possible since the degree of  is . For , it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of  satisfy the equation , so they are zeros of . By contrast, in ,  has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so  does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic. It is thus customary to speak of the finite field with  elements, denoted by  or .\n\nHistory\n\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who observed that permuting the zeros  of a cubic polynomial in the expression\n(with  being a third root of unity) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of Scipione del Ferro and François Viète, which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown  to an quadratic equation for . Together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4, Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups. Vandermonde, also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801), studied the equation\nfor a prime  and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic Galois group. Gauss deduced that a regular -gon can be constructed if . Building on Lagrange's work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5) can not be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Niels Henrik Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word Körper, which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by .[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)]\n\nIn 1881 Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a \"domain of rationality\", which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as  abstractly as the rational function field . Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since Joseph Liouville's work in 1844, until Charles Hermite (1873) and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882) proved the transcendence of  and , respectively.\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to .. See also . In particular, Heinrich Martin Weber's notion included the field Fp. Giuseppe Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led  to introduce the field of p-adic numbers.  synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions can be found in Steinitz's work.  linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.\n\nConstructing fields\n\nConstructing fields from rings\n\nA commutative ring is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses . For example, the integers  form a commutative ring, but not a field: the reciprocal of an integer  is not itself an integer, unless .\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as those commutative rings  in which every nonzero element is a unit (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are those commutative rings which have precisely two distinct ideals,  and . Fields are also precisely those commutative rings in which  is the only prime ideal.\n\nGiven a commutative ring , there are two ways to construct a field related to , i.e., two ways of modifying  such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of  is , the rationals, while the residue fields of  are the finite fields .\n\nField of fractions\n\nGiven an integral domain , its field of fractions  is built with the fractions of two elements of  exactly as Q is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of  are the fractions  where  and   are in , and  . Two fractions  and   are equal if and only if . The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.\n\nThe field  of the rational fractions over a field (or an integral domain)  is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring . The field  of Laurent series\n\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)\nover a field  is the field of fractions of the ring  of formal power series (in which ). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of  (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\nResidue fields\n\nIn addition the field of fractions, which embedds  injectively into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring  by means of a surjective map onto a field . Any field obtained in this way is a quotient , where  is a maximal ideal of . If  has only one maximal ideal , this field is called the residue field of .\n\nThe ideal generated by a single polynomial  in the polynomial ring  (over a field E) is maximal if and only if  is irreducible in , i.e., if  can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in  of smaller degree. This yields a field\nThis field  contains an element  (namely the residue class of ) which satisfies the equation\n.\nFor example,  is obtained from  by adjoining the imaginary unit symbol i which satisfies , where . Moreover,  is irreducible over , which implies that the map which sends a polynomial  to  yields an isomorphism\n\\mathbf R[X]/(X^2 + 1) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.\n\nConstructing fields within a bigger field\n\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field , and a field  containing  as a subfield. For any element  of , there is a smallest subfield of  containing  and , called the subfield of F generated by  and denoted . The passage from  to  is referred to by adjoining an element to E. More generally, for a subset , there is a minimal subfield of  containing  and , denoted by .\n\nThe compositum of two subfields  and  of some field  is the smallest subfield of  containing both  and  The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of  satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of  which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over .Further examples include the maximal unramified extension or the maximal abelian extension within .\n\nField extensions\n\nThe notion of a subfield  can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to  being a field extension (or just extension) of , denoted by\n(read \" over ).\nA basic datum of a field extension is its degree , i.e., the dimension of  as an -vector space. It satisfies the formula\n.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions  and  are of degree 2, whereas  is an infinite extension.\n\nAlgebraic extensions\n\nA pivotal notion in the abstract study of field extensions  are algebraic elements . These are roots (or zeros) of polynomials, i.e., they satisfy a polynomial equation\n,\nfor appropriate coefficients . For example,  is algebraic over  and even over  since it satisfies the equation\n.\nA field extension in which every element of  is algebraic over  is called an algebraic extension. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.\n\nThe subfield  generated by an element , as above, is an algebraic extension of  if and only if  is an algebraic element. That is to say, if  is algebraic, all other elements of  are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension , i.e., the dimension of  as an -vector space, equals the minimal degree  such that there is a polynomial equation involving , as above. If this degree is , then the elements of  have the form \n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.\n\nFor example, the field  of Gaussian rationals is the subfield of  consisting of all numbers of the form  where both  and  are rational numbers: summands of the form  (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since  can be simplified to .\n\nTranscendence bases\n\nThe above-mentioned field of rational fractions , where  is an indeterminate, is not an algebraic extension of  since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in  whose zero is . Elements, such as , which are not algebraic are called transcendental. Informally speaking, the indeterminate  and its powers do not interact with elements of . A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension  discussed above is a key example: if  is not algebraic (i.e.,  is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in ), then  is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is obtained by substituting  to  in rational fractions.\n\nA subset  of a field  is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over  and if  is an algebraic extension of . Any field extension  has a transcendence basis. Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form  (purely transcendental extensions) and algebraic extensions.\n\nClosure operations\n\nA field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any polynomial equation\n, with coefficients ,\nhas a solution . By the fundamental theorem of algebra,  is algebraically closed, i.e., any polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are not algebraically closed since the equation\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing  is called an algebraic closure of  if it is algebraic over  (roughly speaking, not too big compared to ) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above,  is an algebraic closure of . The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field  is quite special: by the Artin-Schreier theorem, the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and  is elementarily equivalent to . Such fields are also known as real closed fields.\n\nAny field  has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as the algebraic closure and denoted . For example, the algebraic closure  of  is called the field of algebraic numbers. The field  is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the ultrafilter lemma, a set-theoretic axiom which is weaker than the axiom of choice.. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post] In this regard, the algebraic closure of , is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing  (the ones of order ). For any algebraically closed field  of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field  of Laurent series is the field of Puiseux series, obtained by adjoining roots of .\n\nFields with additional structure\n\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, there are several refinements of the concept which are adapted to the needs of a particular mathematical area.\n\nOrdered fields\n\nA field F is called an ordered field if any two elements can be compared, so that  and  whenever  and . For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering ≥. The Artin-Schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field, which means that any quadratic equation\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0\nonly has the solution . The set of all possible orders on a fixed field F is isomorphic to the set of ring homomorphisms from the Witt ring W(F) of quadratic forms over F, to Z.\n\nAn Archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no infinitesimals (elements which are smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of .\n\nAn ordered field is Dedekind-complete if all upper bounds, lower bounds (see Dedekind cut) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each bounded subset of  is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean, since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence , every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps,  is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism. Several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe hyperreals  form an ordered field which is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of non-standard analysis.\n\nTopological fields\n\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a topological field, in which the set F is a topological space, such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps  and ) are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a metric, i.e., a function\nwhich measures a distance between any two elements of .\n\nThe completion of  is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field  are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a \"gap\" in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of  and  given by the absolute value  is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence, i.e., a sequence whose limit (for ) is zero.\n\nThe field  is used in number theory and -adic analysis. The algebraic closure  carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of complex p-adic numbers and is denoted by .\n\nLocal fields\n\nThe following topological fields are called local fields:Some authors also consider the fields  and  to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that  calls them \"completely anomalous\".\n* finite extensions of  (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of , the field of Laurent series over  (local fields of characteristic ).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements  and  (referred to as uniformizer) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in . (However, since the addition in  is done using carrying, which is not the case in , these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any first order statement which is true for almost all  is also true for almost all . An application of this is the Ax-Kochen theorem describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in .\n* Tamely ramified extensions of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary -power roots of  (in ), respectively of  (in ), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as perfectoid fields. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:\n\\operatorname {Gal}(\\mathbf Q_p(p^{1/p^\\infty})) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}(\\mathbf F_p((t))(t^{1/p^\\infty})).\n\nDifferential fields\n\nDifferential fields are fields equipped with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.\n\nGalois theory\n\nGalois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying the symmetry in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are finite Galois extensions  which are by definition those which are separable and normal. The primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple, i.e., of the form\n,\nwhere  is an irreducible polynomial (as above). For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of  are contained in  and that  has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if  has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the Galois group  is the group of field automorphisms of  that are trivial on  (i.e., the bijections  that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of  to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory which constructs an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of  and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension . By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not solvable (can not be built from abelian groups), then the zeros of  can not be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving \\sqrt[n]{\\ }. For example, the symmetric groups  is not solvable for . Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem:\n(and ),\n(where  is regarded as a polynomial in , for some indeterminates ,  is any field, and ).\n\nThe tensor product of fields is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension  of degree  is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of -algebras\n.\nThis fact is the beginning of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.. See also Étale fundamental group.\n\nInvariants of fields\n\nBasic invariants of a field  include the characteristic and the transcendence degree of  over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in  which are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields  and  are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree. This implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of the same cardinality and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example,  and  are isomorphic (but not isomorphic as topological fields).\n\nModel theory of fields\n\nIn model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two fields  and  are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement which is true for  is also true for  and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be first-order sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n= \"for any , any polynomial of degree  in  has a zero in \" (which amounts to saying that  is algebraically closed).\nThe Lefschetz principle states that  is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field  of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement  holds in  if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.\n\nIf  is an ultrafilter on a set , and  is a field for every  in , the ultraproduct of the  with respect to  is a field. It is denoted by\n,\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields : Łoś's theorem states that any first order statement which holds for all but finitely many , also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence , this shows that there is an isomorphismBoth  and  are algebraically closed by Łoś's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.\n\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.\nThe Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes )\n.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as real closed fields or exponential fields (which are equipped with an exponential function  ).\n\nThe absolute Galois group\n\nFor fields which are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the absolute Galois group  is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs all finite separable extensions of . By elementary means, the group  can be shown to be the Prüfer group, the profinite completion of . This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of  are the fields  for , and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of -adic number fields (finite extensions of ).\n\nRepresentations of Galois groups and of related groups such as the Weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the Langlands program. The cohomological study of such representations is done using Galois cohomology. For example, the Brauer group which is classically defined to be the group of central simple -algebras, can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n.\n\nK-theory\n\nMilnor K-theory is defined as\nK_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem, proved around 2000 by Vladimir Voevodsky, relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\nK_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).\nAlgebraic K-theory is related to the group of invertible matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F×. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\nApplications\n\nLinear algebra and commutative algebra\n\nIf , then the equation \nhas a unique solution  in , namely . This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any vector space has a basis. Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in linear algebra both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\nModules (the analogue of vector spaces) over most rings, including the ring  of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring  is a vector space over a field  in its own right. Such rings are called -algebras and are studied in depth in the area of commutative algebra. For example, Noether normalization asserts that any finitely generated -algebra is closely related to (more precisely, finitely generated as a module over) a polynomial ring .\n\nFinite fields: cryptography and coding theory\n\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n( factors, for an integer )\nin a (large) finite field  can be performed much more efficiently than the discrete logarithm, which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution  to an equation\n.\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an elliptic curve, i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n.\n\nFinite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics.\n\nGeometry: field of functions\n\nFunctions on a topological space  can be added and multiplied pointwise, i.e.,\n.\nIn order to have multiplicative inverses requires considering ratios of functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\nwhere . Such ratios form a field, called the function field of . This concept is of use when  is a complex manifold . In this case,  and  are holomorphic functions, i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios are referred to as meromorphic functions.\n\nThe function field of an algebraic variety  (a geometric object defined by polynomial equations) consists of ratios of regular functions, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions  and . The function field of the -dimensional space over a field  is , i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials  and  in  indeterminates. The function field of  is the same as the one of any open dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing  by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field captures important geometric information about  such as its dimension, which equals the transcendence degree of . For curves (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field  is very close to : if  is smooth and proper (the analogue of being compact),  can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from .More precisely, there is an equivalence of categories between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field  and finite field extensions of . In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about . The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry. The minimal model program attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\nNumber theory: global fields\n\nGlobal fields are in the limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.\nThey are, by definition, number fields (finite extensions of ) or function fields over  (finite extensions of ). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne).\n\nCyclotomic fields are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form , where  is a primitive -th root of unity, i.e., a complex number satisfying  and  for all . For  being a regular prime, Kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove Fermat's last theorem, which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. Ostrowski's theorem asserts that the only completions of , a global field, are the local fields  and . Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the local-global principle. For example, the Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in  and , whose solutions can easily be described.\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. Inverse Galois theory studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group  for some number field . Class field theory describes the abelian extensions, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the Kronecker–Weber theorem, describes the maximal abelian  extension of : it is the field\nobtained by adjoining all primitive -th roots of unity. Kronecker's Jugendtraum asks for a similarly explicit description of  of general number fields . For imaginary quadratic fields, F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d}), , the theory of complex multiplication describes  using elliptic curves. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\nRelated notions\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since 0 ≠ 1 in any field, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of field with one element which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields , as  tends to 1. In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as quasifields, near-fields and semifields.\n\nThere are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called Fields, with a capital F. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory form a Field.\n\nDivision rings\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a division ring or skew field.Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called commutative fields. The only division rings which are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are  itself,  (which is a field), the quaternions  (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the octonions  (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by Michel Kervaire, Raoul Bott, and John Milnor. The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the hairy ball theorem illustrated at the right.\n\nNotes",

    "aggregatedText" : "In mathematics, a field  is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as when they are applied to rational and real numbers. \nA field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of rational numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also in many areas of science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Évariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\nDefinition \n\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation written as , and a multiplication operation written as , both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers, including the existence of an additive inverse  for all elements a, and of a multiplicative inverse b−1 for every nonzero element b. This allows us to consider also the so-called inverse operations of subtraction , and division , via defining:\n,\n.\n\nClassic definition\n\nFormally, a field is a set  together with two operations called addition and multiplication. An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of  and  is called the sum of  and  and denoted . Similarly, the result of the multiplication of  and  is called the product of  and , and denoted  or . These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as field axioms. In the following definitions,   and  are arbitrary elements of the field .\n\n* Associativity of addition and multiplication:   and  .\n* Commutativity of addition and multiplication:  and .\n* Additive and multiplicative identity: there exist two different elements  and  in  such that  and .\n* Additive inverses: for every  in , there exists an element in , denoted , called additive inverse of a, such that .\n* Multiplicative inverses: for every  in , there exists an element in , denoted by , ,  or , called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that .\n* Distributivity of multiplication over addition:  .\n\nAlternative definitions\n\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants  and ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. This approach avoids existential quantifiers, which is important in constructive mathematics and computing.. See also Heyting field.\n\nExamples\n\nRational numbers\n\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers which can be written as fractions\n, where  and  are integers, and . The additive inverse of such a fraction is , and the multiplicative inverse (provided that ) is , which can be seen as follows:\n\n \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  \\frac{ba}{ab} \n 1.\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n{} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) \n \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n{} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} \n \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n\nReal and complex numbers\n\nThe real numbers , with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The complex numbers  consist of expressions\nwhere  is the imaginary unit, i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying .\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that all field axioms hold for . For example, the distributive law enforces\n, which equals .\nThe complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the plane, and addition resp. multiplication of such numbers then corresponds to adding resp. rotating and scaling points. The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\nConstructible numbers\n\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of constructible numbers. Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field  of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within .\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that \\sqrt[3] 2 is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\nA field with four elements\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called , , , and . The notation is chosen such that  plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n, which equals , as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a finite field with four elements, and is denoted  or . The subset consisting of  and  (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the binary field  or . In the context of computer science and Boolean algebra,  and  are often denoted respectively by false and true, the addition is then denoted XOR (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted AND. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with bits.\n\nElementary notions\n\nIn this section,  denotes an arbitrary field and  and  are arbitrary elements of .\n\nConsequences of the definition\n\nOne has  and . In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows .\n\nIf  then  or  must be 0. Indeed, if a ≠ 0, then \n. This means that every field is an integral domain.\n\nThe additive and the multiplicative group of a field\n\nThe axioms of a field  imply that it is an abelian group under addition. This group is called the additive group of the field, and is sometimes denoted by  when denoting it simply as  could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the nonzero elements of  form an abelian group under multiplication, called the multiplicative group, and denoted by  or just } or . \n\nA field may thus be defined as set  equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that  is a group under addition, } is a group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is distributive over addition.Equivalently, a field is an algebraic structure  of type , such that  is not defined,  and \n are abelian groups, and \n· is distributive over +.  Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses  and  are uniquely determined by .\n\nThe requirement  follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0. Thus, the trivial ring, consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic (see ).\n\nCharacteristic\n\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of F, it is possible to define the product  of an arbitrary element  of  by a positive integer  to be the -fold sum\n(which is an element of  .)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n,\nthen  is said to have characteristic 0. For example,  has characteristic 0 since no positive integer  is zero. Otherwise, if there is a positive integer  satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number. It is usually denoted by  and the field is said to have characteristic  then.\nFor example, the field  has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) .\n\nIf  has characteristic , then  for all  in . This implies that \n,\nsince all other binomial coefficients appearing in the binomial formula are divisible by . Here,  ( factors) is the -th power, i.e., the -fold product of the element . Therefore, the Frobenius map\nis compatible with the addition in  (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism. The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic  quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\nSubfields and prime fields\n\nA subfield  of a field  is a subset of  that is a field with respect to the field operations of . Equivalently  is a subset of  that contains , and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that , that for all  both  and  are in , and that for all  in , both  and  are in .\n\nField homomorphisms are maps  between two fields such that , , and , where  and  are arbitrary elements of . All field homomorphisms are injective. If  is also surjective, it is called an isomorphism (or the fields  and  are called isomorphic).\n\nA field is called a prime field if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field  contains a prime field. If the characteristic of  is  (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field  introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to .\n\nFinite fields\n\nFinite fields (also called Galois fields) are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example  is a field with four elements. Its subfield  is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.\n\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic. For a fixed positive integer , arithmetic \"modulo \" means to work with the numbers\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set  of integers, dividing by  and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if  is a prime number. For example, taking the prime  results in the above-mentioned field . For  and more generally, for any composite number (i.e., any number  which can be expressed as a product  of two strictly smaller natural numbers),  is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since  in , which, as was explained above, prevents  from being a field. The field  with  elements ( being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  .\n\nEvery finite field  has  elements, where  is prime and . This statement holds since  may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field. The dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite, say , which implies the asserted statement.\n\nA field with  elements can be constructed as the splitting field of the polynomial \n.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of  in which the polynomial  has  zeros. This means  has as many zeros as possible since the degree of  is . For , it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of  satisfy the equation , so they are zeros of . By contrast, in ,  has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so  does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic. It is thus customary to speak of the finite field with  elements, denoted by  or .\n\nHistory\n\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who observed that permuting the zeros  of a cubic polynomial in the expression\n(with  being a third root of unity) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of Scipione del Ferro and François Viète, which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown  to an quadratic equation for . Together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4, Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups. Vandermonde, also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801), studied the equation\nfor a prime  and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic Galois group. Gauss deduced that a regular -gon can be constructed if . Building on Lagrange's work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5) can not be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Niels Henrik Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word Körper, which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by .[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)]\n\nIn 1881 Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a \"domain of rationality\", which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as  abstractly as the rational function field . Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since Joseph Liouville's work in 1844, until Charles Hermite (1873) and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882) proved the transcendence of  and , respectively.\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to .. See also . In particular, Heinrich Martin Weber's notion included the field Fp. Giuseppe Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led  to introduce the field of p-adic numbers.  synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions can be found in Steinitz's work.  linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.\n\nConstructing fields\n\nConstructing fields from rings\n\nA commutative ring is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses . For example, the integers  form a commutative ring, but not a field: the reciprocal of an integer  is not itself an integer, unless .\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as those commutative rings  in which every nonzero element is a unit (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are those commutative rings which have precisely two distinct ideals,  and . Fields are also precisely those commutative rings in which  is the only prime ideal.\n\nGiven a commutative ring , there are two ways to construct a field related to , i.e., two ways of modifying  such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of  is , the rationals, while the residue fields of  are the finite fields .\n\nField of fractions\n\nGiven an integral domain , its field of fractions  is built with the fractions of two elements of  exactly as Q is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of  are the fractions  where  and   are in , and  . Two fractions  and   are equal if and only if . The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.\n\nThe field  of the rational fractions over a field (or an integral domain)  is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring . The field  of Laurent series\n\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)\nover a field  is the field of fractions of the ring  of formal power series (in which ). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of  (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\nResidue fields\n\nIn addition the field of fractions, which embedds  injectively into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring  by means of a surjective map onto a field . Any field obtained in this way is a quotient , where  is a maximal ideal of . If  has only one maximal ideal , this field is called the residue field of .\n\nThe ideal generated by a single polynomial  in the polynomial ring  (over a field E) is maximal if and only if  is irreducible in , i.e., if  can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in  of smaller degree. This yields a field\nThis field  contains an element  (namely the residue class of ) which satisfies the equation\n.\nFor example,  is obtained from  by adjoining the imaginary unit symbol i which satisfies , where . Moreover,  is irreducible over , which implies that the map which sends a polynomial  to  yields an isomorphism\n\\mathbf R[X]/(X^2 + 1) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.\n\nConstructing fields within a bigger field\n\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field , and a field  containing  as a subfield. For any element  of , there is a smallest subfield of  containing  and , called the subfield of F generated by  and denoted . The passage from  to  is referred to by adjoining an element to E. More generally, for a subset , there is a minimal subfield of  containing  and , denoted by .\n\nThe compositum of two subfields  and  of some field  is the smallest subfield of  containing both  and  The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of  satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of  which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over .Further examples include the maximal unramified extension or the maximal abelian extension within .\n\nField extensions\n\nThe notion of a subfield  can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to  being a field extension (or just extension) of , denoted by\n(read \" over ).\nA basic datum of a field extension is its degree , i.e., the dimension of  as an -vector space. It satisfies the formula\n.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions  and  are of degree 2, whereas  is an infinite extension.\n\nAlgebraic extensions\n\nA pivotal notion in the abstract study of field extensions  are algebraic elements . These are roots (or zeros) of polynomials, i.e., they satisfy a polynomial equation\n,\nfor appropriate coefficients . For example,  is algebraic over  and even over  since it satisfies the equation\n.\nA field extension in which every element of  is algebraic over  is called an algebraic extension. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.\n\nThe subfield  generated by an element , as above, is an algebraic extension of  if and only if  is an algebraic element. That is to say, if  is algebraic, all other elements of  are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension , i.e., the dimension of  as an -vector space, equals the minimal degree  such that there is a polynomial equation involving , as above. If this degree is , then the elements of  have the form \n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.\n\nFor example, the field  of Gaussian rationals is the subfield of  consisting of all numbers of the form  where both  and  are rational numbers: summands of the form  (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since  can be simplified to .\n\nTranscendence bases\n\nThe above-mentioned field of rational fractions , where  is an indeterminate, is not an algebraic extension of  since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in  whose zero is . Elements, such as , which are not algebraic are called transcendental. Informally speaking, the indeterminate  and its powers do not interact with elements of . A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension  discussed above is a key example: if  is not algebraic (i.e.,  is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in ), then  is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is obtained by substituting  to  in rational fractions.\n\nA subset  of a field  is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over  and if  is an algebraic extension of . Any field extension  has a transcendence basis. Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form  (purely transcendental extensions) and algebraic extensions.\n\nClosure operations\n\nA field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any polynomial equation\n, with coefficients ,\nhas a solution . By the fundamental theorem of algebra,  is algebraically closed, i.e., any polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are not algebraically closed since the equation\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing  is called an algebraic closure of  if it is algebraic over  (roughly speaking, not too big compared to ) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above,  is an algebraic closure of . The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field  is quite special: by the Artin-Schreier theorem, the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and  is elementarily equivalent to . Such fields are also known as real closed fields.\n\nAny field  has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as the algebraic closure and denoted . For example, the algebraic closure  of  is called the field of algebraic numbers. The field  is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the ultrafilter lemma, a set-theoretic axiom which is weaker than the axiom of choice.. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post] In this regard, the algebraic closure of , is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing  (the ones of order ). For any algebraically closed field  of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field  of Laurent series is the field of Puiseux series, obtained by adjoining roots of .\n\nFields with additional structure\n\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, there are several refinements of the concept which are adapted to the needs of a particular mathematical area.\n\nOrdered fields\n\nA field F is called an ordered field if any two elements can be compared, so that  and  whenever  and . For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering ≥. The Artin-Schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field, which means that any quadratic equation\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0\nonly has the solution . The set of all possible orders on a fixed field F is isomorphic to the set of ring homomorphisms from the Witt ring W(F) of quadratic forms over F, to Z.\n\nAn Archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no infinitesimals (elements which are smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of .\n\nAn ordered field is Dedekind-complete if all upper bounds, lower bounds (see Dedekind cut) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each bounded subset of  is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean, since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence , every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps,  is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism. Several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe hyperreals  form an ordered field which is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of non-standard analysis.\n\nTopological fields\n\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a topological field, in which the set F is a topological space, such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps  and ) are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a metric, i.e., a function\nwhich measures a distance between any two elements of .\n\nThe completion of  is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field  are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a \"gap\" in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of  and  given by the absolute value  is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence, i.e., a sequence whose limit (for ) is zero.\n\nThe field  is used in number theory and -adic analysis. The algebraic closure  carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of complex p-adic numbers and is denoted by .\n\nLocal fields\n\nThe following topological fields are called local fields:Some authors also consider the fields  and  to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that  calls them \"completely anomalous\".\n* finite extensions of  (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of , the field of Laurent series over  (local fields of characteristic ).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements  and  (referred to as uniformizer) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in . (However, since the addition in  is done using carrying, which is not the case in , these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any first order statement which is true for almost all  is also true for almost all . An application of this is the Ax-Kochen theorem describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in .\n* Tamely ramified extensions of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary -power roots of  (in ), respectively of  (in ), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as perfectoid fields. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:\n\\operatorname {Gal}(\\mathbf Q_p(p^{1/p^\\infty})) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}(\\mathbf F_p((t))(t^{1/p^\\infty})).\n\nDifferential fields\n\nDifferential fields are fields equipped with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.\n\nGalois theory\n\nGalois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying the symmetry in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are finite Galois extensions  which are by definition those which are separable and normal. The primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple, i.e., of the form\n,\nwhere  is an irreducible polynomial (as above). For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of  are contained in  and that  has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if  has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the Galois group  is the group of field automorphisms of  that are trivial on  (i.e., the bijections  that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of  to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory which constructs an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of  and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension . By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not solvable (can not be built from abelian groups), then the zeros of  can not be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving \\sqrt[n]{\\ }. For example, the symmetric groups  is not solvable for . Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem:\n(and ),\n(where  is regarded as a polynomial in , for some indeterminates ,  is any field, and ).\n\nThe tensor product of fields is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension  of degree  is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of -algebras\n.\nThis fact is the beginning of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.. See also Étale fundamental group.\n\nInvariants of fields\n\nBasic invariants of a field  include the characteristic and the transcendence degree of  over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in  which are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields  and  are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree. This implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of the same cardinality and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example,  and  are isomorphic (but not isomorphic as topological fields).\n\nModel theory of fields\n\nIn model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two fields  and  are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement which is true for  is also true for  and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be first-order sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n= \"for any , any polynomial of degree  in  has a zero in \" (which amounts to saying that  is algebraically closed).\nThe Lefschetz principle states that  is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field  of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement  holds in  if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.\n\nIf  is an ultrafilter on a set , and  is a field for every  in , the ultraproduct of the  with respect to  is a field. It is denoted by\n,\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields : Łoś's theorem states that any first order statement which holds for all but finitely many , also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence , this shows that there is an isomorphismBoth  and  are algebraically closed by Łoś's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.\n\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.\nThe Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes )\n.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as real closed fields or exponential fields (which are equipped with an exponential function  ).\n\nThe absolute Galois group\n\nFor fields which are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the absolute Galois group  is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs all finite separable extensions of . By elementary means, the group  can be shown to be the Prüfer group, the profinite completion of . This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of  are the fields  for , and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of -adic number fields (finite extensions of ).\n\nRepresentations of Galois groups and of related groups such as the Weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the Langlands program. The cohomological study of such representations is done using Galois cohomology. For example, the Brauer group which is classically defined to be the group of central simple -algebras, can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n.\n\nK-theory\n\nMilnor K-theory is defined as\nK_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem, proved around 2000 by Vladimir Voevodsky, relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\nK_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).\nAlgebraic K-theory is related to the group of invertible matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F×. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\nApplications\n\nLinear algebra and commutative algebra\n\nIf , then the equation \nhas a unique solution  in , namely . This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any vector space has a basis. Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in linear algebra both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\nModules (the analogue of vector spaces) over most rings, including the ring  of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring  is a vector space over a field  in its own right. Such rings are called -algebras and are studied in depth in the area of commutative algebra. For example, Noether normalization asserts that any finitely generated -algebra is closely related to (more precisely, finitely generated as a module over) a polynomial ring .\n\nFinite fields: cryptography and coding theory\n\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n( factors, for an integer )\nin a (large) finite field  can be performed much more efficiently than the discrete logarithm, which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution  to an equation\n.\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an elliptic curve, i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n.\n\nFinite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics.\n\nGeometry: field of functions\n\nFunctions on a topological space  can be added and multiplied pointwise, i.e.,\n.\nIn order to have multiplicative inverses requires considering ratios of functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\nwhere . Such ratios form a field, called the function field of . This concept is of use when  is a complex manifold . In this case,  and  are holomorphic functions, i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios are referred to as meromorphic functions.\n\nThe function field of an algebraic variety  (a geometric object defined by polynomial equations) consists of ratios of regular functions, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions  and . The function field of the -dimensional space over a field  is , i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials  and  in  indeterminates. The function field of  is the same as the one of any open dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing  by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field captures important geometric information about  such as its dimension, which equals the transcendence degree of . For curves (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field  is very close to : if  is smooth and proper (the analogue of being compact),  can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from .More precisely, there is an equivalence of categories between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field  and finite field extensions of . In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about . The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry. The minimal model program attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\nNumber theory: global fields\n\nGlobal fields are in the limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.\nThey are, by definition, number fields (finite extensions of ) or function fields over  (finite extensions of ). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne).\n\nCyclotomic fields are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form , where  is a primitive -th root of unity, i.e., a complex number satisfying  and  for all . For  being a regular prime, Kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove Fermat's last theorem, which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. Ostrowski's theorem asserts that the only completions of , a global field, are the local fields  and . Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the local-global principle. For example, the Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in  and , whose solutions can easily be described.\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. Inverse Galois theory studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group  for some number field . Class field theory describes the abelian extensions, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the Kronecker–Weber theorem, describes the maximal abelian  extension of : it is the field\nobtained by adjoining all primitive -th roots of unity. Kronecker's Jugendtraum asks for a similarly explicit description of  of general number fields . For imaginary quadratic fields, F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d}), , the theory of complex multiplication describes  using elliptic curves. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\nRelated notions\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since 0 ≠ 1 in any field, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of field with one element which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields , as  tends to 1. In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as quasifields, near-fields and semifields.\n\nThere are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called Fields, with a capital F. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory form a Field.\n\nDivision rings\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a division ring or skew field.Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called commutative fields. The only division rings which are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are  itself,  (which is a field), the quaternions  (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the octonions  (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by Michel Kervaire, Raoul Bott, and John Milnor. The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the hairy ball theorem illustrated at the right.\n\nNotes. Field (mathematics). http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=10603."
