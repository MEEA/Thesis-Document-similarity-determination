  "textBody" : "Latin declension is the patterns according to which Latin words are declined, or have their endings altered to show grammatical case and gender. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. For simple declension paradigms, visit the Wiktionary appendices:\nfirst declension, second declension, third declension, fourth declension, fifth declension. Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.\n\nAdjectives are of two kinds: those like  'good' belong to the first and second declensions, using first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as  belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives. \n\nPronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as  'I' and  'you ()', which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as  'this' and  'that' which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in -īus or -ius instead of -ī or -ae.\n\nThe cardinal numbers  'one',  'two', and  'three' also have their own declensions (ūnus has genitive -īus like a pronoun), and there are also numeral adjectives such as  'a pair, two each', which decline like ordinary adjectives.\n\nGrammatical cases \n\nA complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. However, the locative is limited to few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.\n\nThey are often abbreviated to the first three letters.\n\nThe Latin cases have usually been given in the order –––––(–) in Britain and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's Latin Primer (1866). This order reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings (see below). For a discussion of other sequences taught elsewhere, see below.\n\nHowever, some didactic approaches or schools teach it in the order ––––– or –––––, the order also used before the Latin Primer by Benjamin Hall Kennedy. This order is used in The School and University Eton Latin Grammar (1861),Mongan, James Roscoe (1861). The School and University Eton Latin Grammar, Explanatory and Critical. London 1861. with the ablative case always cited last, and a similar one is used in grammars of Ancient Greek (except without the ablative case, which does not occur in Greek), and has been retained by some modern didactic approaches to allow comparison of Latin and Greek.\n\nMeanings and functions of the various cases\n\n* The nominative case marks the subject of a statement and denotes the person or object that performs the action of the verb in the sentence. For example, \"Mary is going to the store\" or \"Mary is my sister\". It is also used for the predicate: \"Mary is my sister\". The nominative singular (for adjectives, masculine nominative singular) is used as the reference form of the word.\n* The vocative case is used to address someone or something in direct speech. In English, this function is expressed by intonation or punctuation: \"Mary, are you going to the store?\" or \"Mary!\" In most declensions, the vocative singular form is identical to the nominative singular form; for example,  to say \"sailor!\" the noun  has the vocative form nauta. There are a few exceptions. For the masculine singular second declension nouns, -us and -ius become -e and -ī, respectively. For example,  becomes Brute (English \"Brutus!\"). Similarly,  becomes Vergilī (English \"Virgil!\"). Finally, in Greek masculine first declension names  becomes Aenēā (English \"Aeneas!\"). In the plural the vocative is always identical to the nominative.\n* The accusative case marks the direct object of a verb. It also has various other functions, e.g., it is governed by some prepositions. It can be used to express motion towards something, with or without a preposition.\n* The genitive case expresses possession, measurement, or source. Many of its uses correspond in English to uses of the preposition 'of', and in some situations to the English possessive.\n* The dative case marks the recipient of an action, the indirect object of a verb. In English, the prepositions to and for frequently correspond to this case, though there are also many uses of these prepositions which do not correspond to the dative case.\n* The ablative case expresses separation, indirection, or the means by which an action is performed. In English, the prepositions by, with, from, in, and on are most commonly used to indicate these meanings.\n* The locative case expresses the place where an action is performed. In early Latin the locative case had extensive use, but in Classical Latin the locative case was very rarely used, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. For this purpose, the Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. In the first and second declension singular, the locative is identical to the genitive singular, and in the third declension singular it is identical to the dative singular. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative. The few fourth- and fifth-declension place names would also use the ablative form for the locative case. However, a few nouns use the locative instead of a preposition:  → bellī 'at war';  → domī 'at home';  → rūrī 'in the country';  → humī 'on the ground';  → mīlitiae 'in military service, in the field';  → focī 'at the hearth', 'at the center of the community'. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was interchangeable between the ablative and dative but, in the Augustan period, the use of the dative became fixed.\n\nSyncretism\n \nSyncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:\n\nGender-specific\n\n* For pure Latin neuter nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative singular are identical; and the nominative plural, vocative plural, and accusative plural all end in -a (both of these features are inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and so are not true syncretism as the case endings were never separate in the first place).\n\nCase-specific\n\n* The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension masculine nouns ending in -us and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension  is Aenēā.\n* The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension masculine and feminine pure Latin nouns.\n* The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.\n* The dative is always the same as the ablative in the plural, and in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full i-stems (i.e. neuter i-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.\n* The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.\n* The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declensions.\n\nHistory of cases \n\nOld Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.\n\nNouns \n\nThere are five declensions for Latin nouns:\n\n First declension (a stems) \n\nNouns of this declension usually end in -a in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g.   ('road') and   ('water'). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g.   ('poet'),   ('farmer') and   ('sailor').\n\nThe predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is a. The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending -a, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus -ae.\n\nThe locative endings for the first declension are -ae (singular) and -īs (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in mīlitiae 'in war' and Athēnīs 'at Athens'.Allen and Greenough. §43 c.\n\n First declension Greek nouns \n\nThe first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's Alpha Declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but are sometimes treated as if they were native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative  ('athlete') instead of the original athlētēs. Interestingly, archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: nephelēgeréta Zeus ('Zeus the cloud-gatherer') had in classical Greek become nephelēgerétēs.\n\nFor full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.\n\n Second declension (o stems) \n\nThe second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like  ('horse') and  ('boy') and neuter nouns like  ('fort'). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities.\n\nIn the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending -us, although some end in -er, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending -um. However, every second-declension noun has the ending -ī attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is o.\n\nThe locative singular ending for the second declension was -ī, like the genitive singular, as in  \"at Corinth\". The locative plural ending for the second declension was -īs, like the ablative plural, as in  \"at Philippi\".Allen and Greenough. §49 a.\n\nNouns ending in -ius and -ium have a genitive singular in -ī in earlier Latin, which was regularized to -iī in the later language. Masculine nouns in -ius have a vocative singular in -ī at all stages. These forms in -ī are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular Vergilī (from ) is pronounced, with stress on the penult, even though it is short.Gildersleeve & Lodge §15, Allen & Greenough §12, §49c\n\nThere is no contraction of -iī(s) in plural forms and in the locative.[http://avitus.alcuinus.net/schola_latina/declinatio_en.php SCHOLA LATINA EUROPÆA & UNIVERSALIS. Latiné loqui disce sine molestiá! Learn to speak Latin with ease! ¡Aprende a hablar latín sin esfuerzo! Apprenez à parler latin sans peine! Impara a parlare latino senza sforzo! Lernen Sie Latein zu sprechen ohne Mühe!]\n\nIn the older language, nouns ending with -vus, -quus and -vum take o rather than u in the nominative and accusative singular. For example,  ('slave') could be servos, accusative servom.\n\n Second-declension -r nouns \n\nSome masculine nouns of the second declension end in -er or -ir in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the e is dropped. For example,  ('father-in-law') keeps its e. However, the noun  ('teacher') drops its e in the genitive singular. Nouns with -ir in the nominative singular, such as , never drop the i.\n\nThe declension of second-declension -r nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, with the exception of the vocative singular, which is identical to the nominative rather than ending in -e.\n\nFor declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the corresponding Wiktionary appendix.\n\n Second-declension Greek nouns \n\nThe second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.\n\nSome Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example,  can appear as theātrum.\n\n Irregular forms \n\nThe inflection of  ('god') is irregular. The vocative singular of deus is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of Deus ('God') is Deus.\n\nIn poetry, -um may be substituted for -ōrum as the genitive plural ending.\n\n Third declension (i and consonant stems) \n\nThe third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in -a,-e, -ī, -ō, -y, -c, -l, -n, -r, -s, -t, or -x. This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns. Examples are   ('river'),   ('flower'), and   ('peace'). Each noun has the ending -is as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns each have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in -or (, 'love'). Many feminine nouns end in -īx (, 'phoenix'), and many neuter nouns end in -us with an r stem in the oblique cases ( 'burden';  'time').\n\nThe locative endings for the third declension were -ī or -e (singular) and -ibus (plural), as in  'in the country' and  'at Tralles'.Allen and Greenough. §80.\n\n Third declension i-stem nouns \n\nThe third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called i-stems. i-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure i-stems are indicated by the parisyllabic rule or special neuter endings. Mixed i-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule.\n;Masculine and feminine\nParisyllabic rule: Some masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive as they do in the nominative. For example:  ('stream'). The nominative ends in -is.\nDouble consonant rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have two consonants before the -is in the genitive singular. For example:  ('part').\n;Neuter\nSpecial neuter ending: Neuter third-declension i-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in -al, -ar or -e. For example:  ('animal');  ('spoon');  ('sea').\n\nPure i-stems may exhibit peculiar endings in both singular and plural. Mixed i-stems employ normal (consonant) 3rd declension endings in the singular but i-stem endings in the plural. Note the alternative i-stem endings indicated in parentheses.\n\nThe rules for determining i-stems from non-i-stems and mixed i-stems should be thought of more as guidelines than rules: even among the Romans themselves, the categorization of a third-declension word as an i-stem or non-i-stem was quite fluid. The result is that many words that should be i-stems according to the parisyllabic and consonant stem rules actually are not, such as  ('dog') or  ('youth'). By the parisyllabic rule, canis should be a masculine i-stem and thus differ from the non-i-stems by having an extra -i- in the plural genitive form: *canium. In reality, the plural genitive of canis is canum, the form of a non-i-stem. This fluidity even in Roman times results in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin, as scholars were trying to imitate what was fluid to begin with.\n\nPeculiarities \n\nIn the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.\n\n Fourth declension (u stems) \n\nThe fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words such as   ('wave') and   ('port') with a few feminine exceptions, including   ('hand'). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including   ('knee'). Each noun has the ending -ūs as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is u, but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension i stems.\n\nIn the dative and ablative plural, -ibus is sometimes replaced with -ubus. This is so for only a few nouns, such as  , ('limbs').\n\n ('home') is declined like a full fourth-declension noun, and also like a second-declension noun, except in the dative and ablative plural, which are always domibus. Its locative case is domī (plural, domibus)\n\n Fifth declension (e stems) \n\nThe fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine nouns like   ('affair, matter, thing') and diēs, diēī  ('day'; but  in names of days). Each noun has either the ending -ēī or -eī as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.\n\nNouns ending in -iēs have long ēī in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + -ēs have short eī in these cases.\n\nThe locative ending of the fifth declension was -ē (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in  ('today').\n\n Locative case \n\nThe locative case expresses the place where an action is performed. In early Latin the locative case had extensive use, but in Classical Latin the locative case was very rarely used, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. For this purpose, the Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. In the first and second declension singular, the locative is identical to the genitive singular, and in the third declension singular it is identical to the dative singular. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative. The few fourth- and fifth-declension place names would also use the ablative form for the locative case. However, a few nouns use the locative instead of a preposition:  → bellī 'at war';  → domī 'at home';  → rūrī 'in the country';  → humī 'on the ground';  → mīlitiae 'in military service, in the field';  → focī 'at the hearth', 'at the center of the community'. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was interchangeable between the ablative and dative but, in the Augustan period, the use of the dative became fixed.\n\nPronouns \n\nPersonal pronouns \n\nThe first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender.\n\nThe genitive forms , , , ,  are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas ,  are used with a partitive meaning ('[one] of us', '[one] of you'). To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , ,  are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. pater meus 'my father', māter mea 'my mother'. The vocative singular masculine of meus is mī: mī Attice 'my dear Atticus'.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum 6.1.20 etc.\n\nUsually, to show the ablative of accompaniment,  would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, -cum is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is:  'with me',  'with us',  'with you', ,  and  (sometimes ).\n\nFor the third person pronoun  'he', see below.\n\nReflexive pronoun (sē)\n\nThe third person reflexive pronoun  always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural:\n\nThis pronoun has a possessive adjective: , meaning 'his/her/its/their own': \n\nPatrem suum numquam vīderat. (Cicero)Cicero, Pro Rabirio Postumo 4\n\"He had never seen his [own] father.\"\n\nWhen 'his' or 'her' refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun  'of him' is used instead of suus:\nFit obviam Clodio ante fundum eius. (Cicero)Cicero, Pro Milone 29\n\"He met Clodius in front of the latter's farm.\"\n\nWhen one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, sē and suus can refer to either subject:\nPatres conscripti ... legatos in Bithyniam miserunt qui ab rege peterent, ne inimicissimum suum secum haberet sibique dederet. (Nepos)Cornelius Nepos, Hannibal 12.2\n\"The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep their greatest enemy with him but hand him over to them.\"\n\nDemonstrative pronouns and adjectives \n\nRelative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:\n* the nominatives are often irregular\n* the genitive singular ends in -īus rather than -ae or -ī.\n* the dative singular ends in -ī: rather than -ae or -ō.\n\nThese differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( 'whole',  'alone',  'one',  'no',  'another',  'another [of two]', etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.\n\nAll demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun,  'who?' and  'what?' are usually used for the pronominal form,  and  'which?' for the adjectival form.\n\nThird person pronoun\n\nThe weak demonstrative pronoun , ,  'that' also serves as the third person pronoun 'he, she, it':\n\nThis pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. is homo 'that man', ea pecunia 'that money'. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: pater eius 'his/her father'; pater eōrum 'their father'.\n\nDeclension of īdem \n\nThe pronoun or pronominal adjective  means 'the same'. It is derived from is with the suffix -dem. However, some forms have been assimilated.\n\nOther demonstrative pronouns\n\nSimilar in declension is  'another'.\n\nIntensive pronoun \n\nInterrogative pronouns \n\nThe interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.\n\nRelative pronouns \n\nCorrelatives\n\nCorrelatives are the corresponding demonstrative, relative, interrogative, and indefinite forms of pronouns, pronominal adjectives, and adverbs. These are shown below:Allen and Greenough. §152: correlatives.\n\nAdjectives \n\nFirst- and second-declension adjectives \n\nFirst- and second-declension adjective are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in -us (although some end in -er, see below), the feminine form ends in -a, and the neuter form ends in -um. Therefore, some adjectives are given like .\n\nFirst- and second-declension -r adjectives \n\nSome first- and second-declension adjectives' masculine form end in -er. As with second-declension -r nouns, some adjectives retain the e throughout inflection, and some omit it.  omits its e while  keeps it.\n\nFirst and second -īus genitive adjectives \n\nNine first and second declension adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym ūnus nauta. They are:\n\n* 'any'\n* 'no, none'\n* 'which [of two], either'\n* 'sole, alone'\n* 'neither\n* (genitive singular alīus often replaced by  'another'\n* 'one'\n* 'whole'\n* 'other [of two]'\n\nThird-declension adjectives \n\nThird-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension i-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have -ī rather than -e in the ablative singular (unlike i-stem nouns, in which only pure i-stems have -ī). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending  ('old, aged'), have -e in the ablative singular, -um in the genitive plural, and -a in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.\n\nThird-declension adjectives with one ending\n\nThese have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.\n\nNon-i-stem variant\n\nThird-declension adjectives with two endings \n\nThird-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is -is, and the ending for the neuter is -e. It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.\n\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings \n\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension -r nouns, the masculine ends in -er. The feminine ends in -ris, and the neuter ends in -re. The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.\n\nComparative and superlative forms of adjectives \n\nAs in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding -ior for the masculine and feminine, and -ius for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding -iōris. Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as i-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding -issimus, -issima, -issimum to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.\n\nGeneral pattern for comparatives\n\nComparatives and superlatives with normal endings\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -er adjectives \n\nAdjectives (in the first and second  as well as third declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in -er are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding -ior to the stem, but for the superlative, -rimus is added to the nominative masculine singular.\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -lis adjectives \n\nSome third declension adjectives with two endings in -lis in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -eus/-ius adjectives \n\nFirst and second declension adjectives that end in -eus or -ius are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead,  ('more') and  ('most'), the comparative and superlative degrees of  ('much, greatly'), respectively, are used.\n\nIrregular comparatives and superlatives \n\nAs in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.\n\nDeclension of numerals \n\nThere are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.\n\nCardinal numerals \n\nAll cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except  ('one'),  ('two'),  ('three'), plural hundreds  ('two hundred'),  ('three hundred') etc., and  ('thousand'), which have cases and genders like adjectives.  is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with -īus in the genitive, and -ī in the dative.  is declined irregularly,  is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, -centī ('hundred') numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and  is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension i-stem neuter noun in the plural:\n\nThe existence of plural endings for ūnus might seem unnecessary; however, they are used with pluralia tantum nouns, e. g. ūna castra (one [military] camp), ūnae scālae (one ladder).\n\nThe word  ('both'), is declined like duo except that its o is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number, otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.\n\nThe numeral  ('one hundred') is indeclinable, but all the other hundred numerals are declinable.\n\nThe word mīlle 'thousand' is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, mīlia, is a plural third-declension i-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase \"four thousand horses\" in Latin, the genitive is used: quattuor mīlia equōrum, literally, \"four thousands of horses\".\n\nThe rest of the numbers are indeclinable whether used as adjectives or as substantives.\n\nThe conjunction  between numerals can be omitted: vigintī ūnus, centum ūnus. Et is not used when there are more than two words in a compound numeral: centum trīgintā quattuor. The word order in the numerals from 21 to 99 may be inverted: ūnus et vigintī. Numbers ending in 8 or 9 are usually named in subtractive manner: duodētrīgintā, ūndēquadrāgintā.\n\nOrdinal numerals \n\nOrdinal numerals all decline like normal first- and second-declension adjectives. When declining two-word ordinals (thirteenth onwards), both words decline to match in gender, number and case.\n\n*  'first'\n*  'second'\n*  'third'\n* / 'twentieth'\n\nNote: secundus only means 'second' in the sense of 'following'. The adjective  meaning 'other [of two]' was more frequently used in many instances that English would use 'second'.\n\nOrdinal numbers, not cardinal numbers, are commonly used to represent dates, because they are in the format of \"in the tenth year of Caesar\", etc. which also carried over into the anno Domini system and Christian dating, e.g. annō post Christum nātum centēsimō for AD 100.\n\nNumerals for plurals with singular meaning \n\nCertain nouns in Latin were pluralia tantum, i.e. nouns that did not exist in the grammatical singular, for example  'letter',  'camp',  'set of chains',  'clothes',  'winter quarters',  'wedding',  'quadriga' etc. A special series of numeral adjectives was used for counting these, namely , , , , , , and so on. Thus Roman authors would write: ūnae litterae \"one letter\", trīnae litterae \"three letters\", quīna castra \"five camps\", etc.non dicimus biga una, quadrigae duae, nuptiae tres, sed pro eo unae bigae, binae quadrigae, trinae nuptiae \"we don't sayuna biga (one two-horse chariot), duae quadrigae (two four-horse chariots), tres nuptiae (three weddings) but instead unae bigae, binae quadrigae, trinae nuptiae\" (Varro).\n\nDistributive numerals \n\nAnother set of numeral adjectives, similar to the above but differing in the adjectives for 1, 3, and 4, were the distributive numerals: , , , , , , and so on. The meaning of these is 'one each', 'two each' (or 'in pairs') and so on, for example ibī turrīs cum ternīs tabulātīs ērigēbat \"there he began erecting towers with three storeys each\" (Julius Caesar); bīnī senātōrēs singulīs cohortibus praepositī \"a pair of senators was put in charge of each group of soldiers\" (Livy).\n\nAdverbial numerals \n\nAdverbial numerals are (as the name states) indeclinable adverbs, but because all of the other numeral constructions are adjectives, they are listed here with them. Adverbial numerals give how many times a thing happened.  'once',  'twice',  'thrice, three times',  'four times', and so on.\n\nThe suffix -iēns may also be spelled -iēs: , , etc.\n\nMultiplicative numerals \n\nMultiplicative numerals are declinable adjectives. They give how many times a thing is.  'single',  'double',  'treble',  'fourfold', and so on.\n\nProportional numerals \n\nProportional numerals are declinable adjectives.  'simple',  'twice as great',  'thrice as great',  'four times as great', and so on.\n\nTemporal numerals \n\nTemporal numerals are indeclinable adverbs.  'in [a period of] one year, of one year';  'in/of two years';  'in/of three years';  'in/of four years'; and so on.\n\nPartitive numerals \n\nPartitive are declinable adjectives.  'of one part',  'of two parts',  'of three parts',  'of four parts', and so on.\n\nAdverbs and their comparatives and superlatives \n\nAdverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.\n\nAdverbs from first- and second-declension adjectives \n\nFirst and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding -ē onto their bases.\n\nAdverbs from third declension adjectives \n\nTypically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding -iter to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add -er to the stem.\n\nComparative and superlative of adverbs \n\nAdverbs' comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs' superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending -ē to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in -eus or -ius use  and  as opposed to distinct endings.\n\nIrregular adverbs and their comparative and superlative forms \n\nAs with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.\n\nPeculiarities within declension \n\nIrregularity in number \n\nSome nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:\n* materials, such as  ('gold') and  ('copper, bronze')\n* abstract nouns, such as  ('speed') and  ('knowledge)\nSome nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum) such as:\n* many festivals, such as  ('Saturnalia')\n*  ('camp') and  ('arms')\n* a few geographical names are plural such as  ('Thebes', both the Greek and the Egyptian cities)\n\nIndeclinable nouns \n\nIndeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).\n*  ('fate, divine law')\n*  ('likeness')\n*  ('morning')\n*  ('sin, abomination')\n* / ('nothing, none')\n*  ('sex')\n\nHeterogeneous nouns \n\nHeterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.\n\n* A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.\n* Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.\n\nPlurals with alternative meanings \n\nOrder of the cases\n\nIn modern textbooks of Latin, there is no single international standard for the sequence of cases.\n\n–()–––––()\n\nThis order reflects the syncretic trends of different cases to share similar endings. Usually the vocative and locative cases are omitted because they appear in the paradigm of only a few word classes and are dealt with separately. This makes the paradigm appear normally in the format ––––, which is also roughly the order of how frequently the cases appear in Latin text, meaning that the cases are introduced in teaching in this order. This paradigm has been the usual order in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's Latin Primer (1866). It is the only method nowadays used in Hungary and Finland. It is also usual in France, Spain, and Portugal.\n\n––––()––()\n\nThis alternative sequence arose from Byzantine grammarians who were originally writing about Greek. It is standard in the United States, although modern texts increasingly move the vocative at the end to minimize disruption to the declensions in which it is identical to the nominative; some introductory texts such as Wheelock's Latin almost entirely ignore the vocative and locative except for a few brief notes, giving the format –––––(). This paradigm is also used in Poland, as it closely corresponds to the conventional case order in the Polish language, except for the latter's use of an instrumental case instead of an ablative. The same sequence is predominant in the Netherlands, although the modern Dutch language has largely lost its case system; instead, the rationale is that this general order is convenient for the consistent teaching of three different commonly studied declensional languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, and modern German. The order ––––()– is also used in Germany itself to echo the conventional order of German cases (–––), and also in Lithuania because the conventional order of Lithuanian noun cases is the same. The locative is dealt with separately as it is seldom used in Latin and might be considered to be on the verge of extinction in Classical Latin.\n\nThe order ––––– is the standard order used in Greece (both for the teaching of Ancient and Modern Greek as well as Latin) and Italy (with the vocative case before the ablative). Here again, the locative is dealt with separately.\n\nOthers\n\nBrazilian grammarian Napoleão Mendes used the unusual sequence –––––. The Latinum podcast uses –––––, as this facilitates memorisation. Latinum deals with the locative separately.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Latin declension is the patterns according to which Latin words are declined, or have their endings altered to show grammatical case and gender. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. For simple declension paradigms, visit the Wiktionary appendices:\nfirst declension, second declension, third declension, fourth declension, fifth declension. Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.\n\nAdjectives are of two kinds: those like  'good' belong to the first and second declensions, using first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as  belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives. \n\nPronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as  'I' and  'you ()', which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as  'this' and  'that' which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in -īus or -ius instead of -ī or -ae.\n\nThe cardinal numbers  'one',  'two', and  'three' also have their own declensions (ūnus has genitive -īus like a pronoun), and there are also numeral adjectives such as  'a pair, two each', which decline like ordinary adjectives.\n\nGrammatical cases \n\nA complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. However, the locative is limited to few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.\n\nThey are often abbreviated to the first three letters.\n\nThe Latin cases have usually been given in the order –––––(–) in Britain and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's Latin Primer (1866). This order reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings (see below). For a discussion of other sequences taught elsewhere, see below.\n\nHowever, some didactic approaches or schools teach it in the order ––––– or –––––, the order also used before the Latin Primer by Benjamin Hall Kennedy. This order is used in The School and University Eton Latin Grammar (1861),Mongan, James Roscoe (1861). The School and University Eton Latin Grammar, Explanatory and Critical. London 1861. with the ablative case always cited last, and a similar one is used in grammars of Ancient Greek (except without the ablative case, which does not occur in Greek), and has been retained by some modern didactic approaches to allow comparison of Latin and Greek.\n\nMeanings and functions of the various cases\n\n* The nominative case marks the subject of a statement and denotes the person or object that performs the action of the verb in the sentence. For example, \"Mary is going to the store\" or \"Mary is my sister\". It is also used for the predicate: \"Mary is my sister\". The nominative singular (for adjectives, masculine nominative singular) is used as the reference form of the word.\n* The vocative case is used to address someone or something in direct speech. In English, this function is expressed by intonation or punctuation: \"Mary, are you going to the store?\" or \"Mary!\" In most declensions, the vocative singular form is identical to the nominative singular form; for example,  to say \"sailor!\" the noun  has the vocative form nauta. There are a few exceptions. For the masculine singular second declension nouns, -us and -ius become -e and -ī, respectively. For example,  becomes Brute (English \"Brutus!\"). Similarly,  becomes Vergilī (English \"Virgil!\"). Finally, in Greek masculine first declension names  becomes Aenēā (English \"Aeneas!\"). In the plural the vocative is always identical to the nominative.\n* The accusative case marks the direct object of a verb. It also has various other functions, e.g., it is governed by some prepositions. It can be used to express motion towards something, with or without a preposition.\n* The genitive case expresses possession, measurement, or source. Many of its uses correspond in English to uses of the preposition 'of', and in some situations to the English possessive.\n* The dative case marks the recipient of an action, the indirect object of a verb. In English, the prepositions to and for frequently correspond to this case, though there are also many uses of these prepositions which do not correspond to the dative case.\n* The ablative case expresses separation, indirection, or the means by which an action is performed. In English, the prepositions by, with, from, in, and on are most commonly used to indicate these meanings.\n* The locative case expresses the place where an action is performed. In early Latin the locative case had extensive use, but in Classical Latin the locative case was very rarely used, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. For this purpose, the Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. In the first and second declension singular, the locative is identical to the genitive singular, and in the third declension singular it is identical to the dative singular. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative. The few fourth- and fifth-declension place names would also use the ablative form for the locative case. However, a few nouns use the locative instead of a preposition:  → bellī 'at war';  → domī 'at home';  → rūrī 'in the country';  → humī 'on the ground';  → mīlitiae 'in military service, in the field';  → focī 'at the hearth', 'at the center of the community'. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was interchangeable between the ablative and dative but, in the Augustan period, the use of the dative became fixed.\n\nSyncretism\n \nSyncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:\n\nGender-specific\n\n* For pure Latin neuter nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative singular are identical; and the nominative plural, vocative plural, and accusative plural all end in -a (both of these features are inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and so are not true syncretism as the case endings were never separate in the first place).\n\nCase-specific\n\n* The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension masculine nouns ending in -us and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension  is Aenēā.\n* The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension masculine and feminine pure Latin nouns.\n* The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.\n* The dative is always the same as the ablative in the plural, and in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full i-stems (i.e. neuter i-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.\n* The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.\n* The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declensions.\n\nHistory of cases \n\nOld Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.\n\nNouns \n\nThere are five declensions for Latin nouns:\n\n First declension (a stems) \n\nNouns of this declension usually end in -a in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g.   ('road') and   ('water'). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g.   ('poet'),   ('farmer') and   ('sailor').\n\nThe predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is a. The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending -a, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus -ae.\n\nThe locative endings for the first declension are -ae (singular) and -īs (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in mīlitiae 'in war' and Athēnīs 'at Athens'.Allen and Greenough. §43 c.\n\n First declension Greek nouns \n\nThe first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's Alpha Declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but are sometimes treated as if they were native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative  ('athlete') instead of the original athlētēs. Interestingly, archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: nephelēgeréta Zeus ('Zeus the cloud-gatherer') had in classical Greek become nephelēgerétēs.\n\nFor full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.\n\n Second declension (o stems) \n\nThe second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like  ('horse') and  ('boy') and neuter nouns like  ('fort'). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities.\n\nIn the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending -us, although some end in -er, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending -um. However, every second-declension noun has the ending -ī attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is o.\n\nThe locative singular ending for the second declension was -ī, like the genitive singular, as in  \"at Corinth\". The locative plural ending for the second declension was -īs, like the ablative plural, as in  \"at Philippi\".Allen and Greenough. §49 a.\n\nNouns ending in -ius and -ium have a genitive singular in -ī in earlier Latin, which was regularized to -iī in the later language. Masculine nouns in -ius have a vocative singular in -ī at all stages. These forms in -ī are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular Vergilī (from ) is pronounced, with stress on the penult, even though it is short.Gildersleeve & Lodge §15, Allen & Greenough §12, §49c\n\nThere is no contraction of -iī(s) in plural forms and in the locative.[http://avitus.alcuinus.net/schola_latina/declinatio_en.php SCHOLA LATINA EUROPÆA & UNIVERSALIS. Latiné loqui disce sine molestiá! Learn to speak Latin with ease! ¡Aprende a hablar latín sin esfuerzo! Apprenez à parler latin sans peine! Impara a parlare latino senza sforzo! Lernen Sie Latein zu sprechen ohne Mühe!]\n\nIn the older language, nouns ending with -vus, -quus and -vum take o rather than u in the nominative and accusative singular. For example,  ('slave') could be servos, accusative servom.\n\n Second-declension -r nouns \n\nSome masculine nouns of the second declension end in -er or -ir in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the e is dropped. For example,  ('father-in-law') keeps its e. However, the noun  ('teacher') drops its e in the genitive singular. Nouns with -ir in the nominative singular, such as , never drop the i.\n\nThe declension of second-declension -r nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, with the exception of the vocative singular, which is identical to the nominative rather than ending in -e.\n\nFor declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the corresponding Wiktionary appendix.\n\n Second-declension Greek nouns \n\nThe second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.\n\nSome Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example,  can appear as theātrum.\n\n Irregular forms \n\nThe inflection of  ('god') is irregular. The vocative singular of deus is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of Deus ('God') is Deus.\n\nIn poetry, -um may be substituted for -ōrum as the genitive plural ending.\n\n Third declension (i and consonant stems) \n\nThe third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in -a,-e, -ī, -ō, -y, -c, -l, -n, -r, -s, -t, or -x. This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns. Examples are   ('river'),   ('flower'), and   ('peace'). Each noun has the ending -is as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns each have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in -or (, 'love'). Many feminine nouns end in -īx (, 'phoenix'), and many neuter nouns end in -us with an r stem in the oblique cases ( 'burden';  'time').\n\nThe locative endings for the third declension were -ī or -e (singular) and -ibus (plural), as in  'in the country' and  'at Tralles'.Allen and Greenough. §80.\n\n Third declension i-stem nouns \n\nThe third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called i-stems. i-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure i-stems are indicated by the parisyllabic rule or special neuter endings. Mixed i-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule.\n;Masculine and feminine\nParisyllabic rule: Some masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive as they do in the nominative. For example:  ('stream'). The nominative ends in -is.\nDouble consonant rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have two consonants before the -is in the genitive singular. For example:  ('part').\n;Neuter\nSpecial neuter ending: Neuter third-declension i-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in -al, -ar or -e. For example:  ('animal');  ('spoon');  ('sea').\n\nPure i-stems may exhibit peculiar endings in both singular and plural. Mixed i-stems employ normal (consonant) 3rd declension endings in the singular but i-stem endings in the plural. Note the alternative i-stem endings indicated in parentheses.\n\nThe rules for determining i-stems from non-i-stems and mixed i-stems should be thought of more as guidelines than rules: even among the Romans themselves, the categorization of a third-declension word as an i-stem or non-i-stem was quite fluid. The result is that many words that should be i-stems according to the parisyllabic and consonant stem rules actually are not, such as  ('dog') or  ('youth'). By the parisyllabic rule, canis should be a masculine i-stem and thus differ from the non-i-stems by having an extra -i- in the plural genitive form: *canium. In reality, the plural genitive of canis is canum, the form of a non-i-stem. This fluidity even in Roman times results in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin, as scholars were trying to imitate what was fluid to begin with.\n\nPeculiarities \n\nIn the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.\n\n Fourth declension (u stems) \n\nThe fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words such as   ('wave') and   ('port') with a few feminine exceptions, including   ('hand'). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including   ('knee'). Each noun has the ending -ūs as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is u, but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension i stems.\n\nIn the dative and ablative plural, -ibus is sometimes replaced with -ubus. This is so for only a few nouns, such as  , ('limbs').\n\n ('home') is declined like a full fourth-declension noun, and also like a second-declension noun, except in the dative and ablative plural, which are always domibus. Its locative case is domī (plural, domibus)\n\n Fifth declension (e stems) \n\nThe fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine nouns like   ('affair, matter, thing') and diēs, diēī  ('day'; but  in names of days). Each noun has either the ending -ēī or -eī as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.\n\nNouns ending in -iēs have long ēī in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + -ēs have short eī in these cases.\n\nThe locative ending of the fifth declension was -ē (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in  ('today').\n\n Locative case \n\nThe locative case expresses the place where an action is performed. In early Latin the locative case had extensive use, but in Classical Latin the locative case was very rarely used, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. For this purpose, the Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. In the first and second declension singular, the locative is identical to the genitive singular, and in the third declension singular it is identical to the dative singular. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative. The few fourth- and fifth-declension place names would also use the ablative form for the locative case. However, a few nouns use the locative instead of a preposition:  → bellī 'at war';  → domī 'at home';  → rūrī 'in the country';  → humī 'on the ground';  → mīlitiae 'in military service, in the field';  → focī 'at the hearth', 'at the center of the community'. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was interchangeable between the ablative and dative but, in the Augustan period, the use of the dative became fixed.\n\nPronouns \n\nPersonal pronouns \n\nThe first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender.\n\nThe genitive forms , , , ,  are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas ,  are used with a partitive meaning ('[one] of us', '[one] of you'). To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , ,  are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. pater meus 'my father', māter mea 'my mother'. The vocative singular masculine of meus is mī: mī Attice 'my dear Atticus'.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum 6.1.20 etc.\n\nUsually, to show the ablative of accompaniment,  would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, -cum is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is:  'with me',  'with us',  'with you', ,  and  (sometimes ).\n\nFor the third person pronoun  'he', see below.\n\nReflexive pronoun (sē)\n\nThe third person reflexive pronoun  always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural:\n\nThis pronoun has a possessive adjective: , meaning 'his/her/its/their own': \n\nPatrem suum numquam vīderat. (Cicero)Cicero, Pro Rabirio Postumo 4\n\"He had never seen his [own] father.\"\n\nWhen 'his' or 'her' refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun  'of him' is used instead of suus:\nFit obviam Clodio ante fundum eius. (Cicero)Cicero, Pro Milone 29\n\"He met Clodius in front of the latter's farm.\"\n\nWhen one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, sē and suus can refer to either subject:\nPatres conscripti ... legatos in Bithyniam miserunt qui ab rege peterent, ne inimicissimum suum secum haberet sibique dederet. (Nepos)Cornelius Nepos, Hannibal 12.2\n\"The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep their greatest enemy with him but hand him over to them.\"\n\nDemonstrative pronouns and adjectives \n\nRelative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:\n* the nominatives are often irregular\n* the genitive singular ends in -īus rather than -ae or -ī.\n* the dative singular ends in -ī: rather than -ae or -ō.\n\nThese differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( 'whole',  'alone',  'one',  'no',  'another',  'another [of two]', etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.\n\nAll demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun,  'who?' and  'what?' are usually used for the pronominal form,  and  'which?' for the adjectival form.\n\nThird person pronoun\n\nThe weak demonstrative pronoun , ,  'that' also serves as the third person pronoun 'he, she, it':\n\nThis pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. is homo 'that man', ea pecunia 'that money'. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: pater eius 'his/her father'; pater eōrum 'their father'.\n\nDeclension of īdem \n\nThe pronoun or pronominal adjective  means 'the same'. It is derived from is with the suffix -dem. However, some forms have been assimilated.\n\nOther demonstrative pronouns\n\nSimilar in declension is  'another'.\n\nIntensive pronoun \n\nInterrogative pronouns \n\nThe interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.\n\nRelative pronouns \n\nCorrelatives\n\nCorrelatives are the corresponding demonstrative, relative, interrogative, and indefinite forms of pronouns, pronominal adjectives, and adverbs. These are shown below:Allen and Greenough. §152: correlatives.\n\nAdjectives \n\nFirst- and second-declension adjectives \n\nFirst- and second-declension adjective are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in -us (although some end in -er, see below), the feminine form ends in -a, and the neuter form ends in -um. Therefore, some adjectives are given like .\n\nFirst- and second-declension -r adjectives \n\nSome first- and second-declension adjectives' masculine form end in -er. As with second-declension -r nouns, some adjectives retain the e throughout inflection, and some omit it.  omits its e while  keeps it.\n\nFirst and second -īus genitive adjectives \n\nNine first and second declension adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym ūnus nauta. They are:\n\n* 'any'\n* 'no, none'\n* 'which [of two], either'\n* 'sole, alone'\n* 'neither\n* (genitive singular alīus often replaced by  'another'\n* 'one'\n* 'whole'\n* 'other [of two]'\n\nThird-declension adjectives \n\nThird-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension i-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have -ī rather than -e in the ablative singular (unlike i-stem nouns, in which only pure i-stems have -ī). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending  ('old, aged'), have -e in the ablative singular, -um in the genitive plural, and -a in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.\n\nThird-declension adjectives with one ending\n\nThese have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.\n\nNon-i-stem variant\n\nThird-declension adjectives with two endings \n\nThird-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is -is, and the ending for the neuter is -e. It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.\n\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings \n\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension -r nouns, the masculine ends in -er. The feminine ends in -ris, and the neuter ends in -re. The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.\n\nComparative and superlative forms of adjectives \n\nAs in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding -ior for the masculine and feminine, and -ius for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding -iōris. Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as i-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding -issimus, -issima, -issimum to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.\n\nGeneral pattern for comparatives\n\nComparatives and superlatives with normal endings\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -er adjectives \n\nAdjectives (in the first and second  as well as third declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in -er are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding -ior to the stem, but for the superlative, -rimus is added to the nominative masculine singular.\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -lis adjectives \n\nSome third declension adjectives with two endings in -lis in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.\n\nComparatives and superlatives of -eus/-ius adjectives \n\nFirst and second declension adjectives that end in -eus or -ius are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead,  ('more') and  ('most'), the comparative and superlative degrees of  ('much, greatly'), respectively, are used.\n\nIrregular comparatives and superlatives \n\nAs in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.\n\nDeclension of numerals \n\nThere are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.\n\nCardinal numerals \n\nAll cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except  ('one'),  ('two'),  ('three'), plural hundreds  ('two hundred'),  ('three hundred') etc., and  ('thousand'), which have cases and genders like adjectives.  is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with -īus in the genitive, and -ī in the dative.  is declined irregularly,  is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, -centī ('hundred') numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and  is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension i-stem neuter noun in the plural:\n\nThe existence of plural endings for ūnus might seem unnecessary; however, they are used with pluralia tantum nouns, e. g. ūna castra (one [military] camp), ūnae scālae (one ladder).\n\nThe word  ('both'), is declined like duo except that its o is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number, otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.\n\nThe numeral  ('one hundred') is indeclinable, but all the other hundred numerals are declinable.\n\nThe word mīlle 'thousand' is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, mīlia, is a plural third-declension i-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase \"four thousand horses\" in Latin, the genitive is used: quattuor mīlia equōrum, literally, \"four thousands of horses\".\n\nThe rest of the numbers are indeclinable whether used as adjectives or as substantives.\n\nThe conjunction  between numerals can be omitted: vigintī ūnus, centum ūnus. Et is not used when there are more than two words in a compound numeral: centum trīgintā quattuor. The word order in the numerals from 21 to 99 may be inverted: ūnus et vigintī. Numbers ending in 8 or 9 are usually named in subtractive manner: duodētrīgintā, ūndēquadrāgintā.\n\nOrdinal numerals \n\nOrdinal numerals all decline like normal first- and second-declension adjectives. When declining two-word ordinals (thirteenth onwards), both words decline to match in gender, number and case.\n\n*  'first'\n*  'second'\n*  'third'\n* / 'twentieth'\n\nNote: secundus only means 'second' in the sense of 'following'. The adjective  meaning 'other [of two]' was more frequently used in many instances that English would use 'second'.\n\nOrdinal numbers, not cardinal numbers, are commonly used to represent dates, because they are in the format of \"in the tenth year of Caesar\", etc. which also carried over into the anno Domini system and Christian dating, e.g. annō post Christum nātum centēsimō for AD 100.\n\nNumerals for plurals with singular meaning \n\nCertain nouns in Latin were pluralia tantum, i.e. nouns that did not exist in the grammatical singular, for example  'letter',  'camp',  'set of chains',  'clothes',  'winter quarters',  'wedding',  'quadriga' etc. A special series of numeral adjectives was used for counting these, namely , , , , , , and so on. Thus Roman authors would write: ūnae litterae \"one letter\", trīnae litterae \"three letters\", quīna castra \"five camps\", etc.non dicimus biga una, quadrigae duae, nuptiae tres, sed pro eo unae bigae, binae quadrigae, trinae nuptiae \"we don't sayuna biga (one two-horse chariot), duae quadrigae (two four-horse chariots), tres nuptiae (three weddings) but instead unae bigae, binae quadrigae, trinae nuptiae\" (Varro).\n\nDistributive numerals \n\nAnother set of numeral adjectives, similar to the above but differing in the adjectives for 1, 3, and 4, were the distributive numerals: , , , , , , and so on. The meaning of these is 'one each', 'two each' (or 'in pairs') and so on, for example ibī turrīs cum ternīs tabulātīs ērigēbat \"there he began erecting towers with three storeys each\" (Julius Caesar); bīnī senātōrēs singulīs cohortibus praepositī \"a pair of senators was put in charge of each group of soldiers\" (Livy).\n\nAdverbial numerals \n\nAdverbial numerals are (as the name states) indeclinable adverbs, but because all of the other numeral constructions are adjectives, they are listed here with them. Adverbial numerals give how many times a thing happened.  'once',  'twice',  'thrice, three times',  'four times', and so on.\n\nThe suffix -iēns may also be spelled -iēs: , , etc.\n\nMultiplicative numerals \n\nMultiplicative numerals are declinable adjectives. They give how many times a thing is.  'single',  'double',  'treble',  'fourfold', and so on.\n\nProportional numerals \n\nProportional numerals are declinable adjectives.  'simple',  'twice as great',  'thrice as great',  'four times as great', and so on.\n\nTemporal numerals \n\nTemporal numerals are indeclinable adverbs.  'in [a period of] one year, of one year';  'in/of two years';  'in/of three years';  'in/of four years'; and so on.\n\nPartitive numerals \n\nPartitive are declinable adjectives.  'of one part',  'of two parts',  'of three parts',  'of four parts', and so on.\n\nAdverbs and their comparatives and superlatives \n\nAdverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.\n\nAdverbs from first- and second-declension adjectives \n\nFirst and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding -ē onto their bases.\n\nAdverbs from third declension adjectives \n\nTypically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding -iter to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add -er to the stem.\n\nComparative and superlative of adverbs \n\nAdverbs' comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs' superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending -ē to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in -eus or -ius use  and  as opposed to distinct endings.\n\nIrregular adverbs and their comparative and superlative forms \n\nAs with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.\n\nPeculiarities within declension \n\nIrregularity in number \n\nSome nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:\n* materials, such as  ('gold') and  ('copper, bronze')\n* abstract nouns, such as  ('speed') and  ('knowledge)\nSome nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum) such as:\n* many festivals, such as  ('Saturnalia')\n*  ('camp') and  ('arms')\n* a few geographical names are plural such as  ('Thebes', both the Greek and the Egyptian cities)\n\nIndeclinable nouns \n\nIndeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).\n*  ('fate, divine law')\n*  ('likeness')\n*  ('morning')\n*  ('sin, abomination')\n* / ('nothing, none')\n*  ('sex')\n\nHeterogeneous nouns \n\nHeterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.\n\n* A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.\n* Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.\n\nPlurals with alternative meanings \n\nOrder of the cases\n\nIn modern textbooks of Latin, there is no single international standard for the sequence of cases.\n\n–()–––––()\n\nThis order reflects the syncretic trends of different cases to share similar endings. Usually the vocative and locative cases are omitted because they appear in the paradigm of only a few word classes and are dealt with separately. This makes the paradigm appear normally in the format ––––, which is also roughly the order of how frequently the cases appear in Latin text, meaning that the cases are introduced in teaching in this order. This paradigm has been the usual order in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's Latin Primer (1866). It is the only method nowadays used in Hungary and Finland. It is also usual in France, Spain, and Portugal.\n\n––––()––()\n\nThis alternative sequence arose from Byzantine grammarians who were originally writing about Greek. It is standard in the United States, although modern texts increasingly move the vocative at the end to minimize disruption to the declensions in which it is identical to the nominative; some introductory texts such as Wheelock's Latin almost entirely ignore the vocative and locative except for a few brief notes, giving the format –––––(). This paradigm is also used in Poland, as it closely corresponds to the conventional case order in the Polish language, except for the latter's use of an instrumental case instead of an ablative. The same sequence is predominant in the Netherlands, although the modern Dutch language has largely lost its case system; instead, the rationale is that this general order is convenient for the consistent teaching of three different commonly studied declensional languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, and modern German. The order ––––()– is also used in Germany itself to echo the conventional order of German cases (–––), and also in Lithuania because the conventional order of Lithuanian noun cases is the same. The locative is dealt with separately as it is seldom used in Latin and might be considered to be on the verge of extinction in Classical Latin.\n\nThe order ––––– is the standard order used in Greece (both for the teaching of Ancient and Modern Greek as well as Latin) and Italy (with the vocative case before the ablative). Here again, the locative is dealt with separately.\n\nOthers\n\nBrazilian grammarian Napoleão Mendes used the unusual sequence –––––. The Latinum podcast uses –––––, as this facilitates memorisation. Latinum deals with the locative separately. Latin declension. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=17997."
