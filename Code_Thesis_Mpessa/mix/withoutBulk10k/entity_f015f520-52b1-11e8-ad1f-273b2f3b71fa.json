  "textBody" : "European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) was a series of integrated programmes of information technology research and development projects and industrial technology transfer measures.

Springer Science & Business Media, 2013.\n* SUNDIAL (Speech UNderstanding DIALgue) started in September 1988 with Logica Ltd. as prime contractor, together with Erlangen University, CSELT, Daimler-Benz, Capgemini, Politecnico di Torino. Followed the Esprit P.26 to implement and evaluate dialogue systems to be used in telephone industry.Peckham, Jeremy. \"Speech Understanding and Dialogue over the telephone: an overview of the ESPRIT SUNDIAL project.\" HLT. 1991. The final results were 4 prototypes in 4 languages, involving speech and understanding technologies, and some criteria for evaluation were also reported.Alberto Ciaramella  (1993):  Prototype  performance evaluation report.

It is frequently cited as an example of digital obsolescence on account of the physical medium used for data storage.\n* CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) is a software library that aims to provide easy access to efficient and reliable algorithms in computational geometry. While primarily written in C++, Python bindings are also available. The original funding for the project came from the ESPRIT project.\n* Eurocoop & Eurocode:  ESPRIT III projects to develop systems for supporting distributed collaborative working.\n* Open Document Architecture, a free and open international standard document file format maintained by the ITU-T to replace all proprietary document file formats. In 1985 ESPRIT financed a pilot implementation of the ODA concept, involving, among others, Bull corporation, Olivetti, ICL and Siemens AG.\n* Paradise:  A sub-project of the ESPRIT I project, COSINE which established a pan-European computer-based network infrastructure that enabled research workers to communicate with each other using OSI.  Paradise implemented a distributed X.500 directory across the academic community.\n* Password: Part of the ESPRIT III VALUE project,  developed secure applications based on the X.509 standard for use in the academic community.\n* RAISE, Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering, was developed as part of the European ESPRIT II LaCoS project in the 1990s, led by Dines Bjørner.\n* REMORA methodology is an event-driven approach for designing information systems, developed by Colette Rolland.
