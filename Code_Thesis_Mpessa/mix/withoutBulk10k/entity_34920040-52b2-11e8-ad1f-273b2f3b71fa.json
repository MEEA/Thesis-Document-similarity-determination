  "textBody" : "Lleida (,; ) is a city in the west of Catalonia, Spain. It is the capital city of the province of Lleida.\n\nGeographically, it is located in the Catalan Central Depression. It is also the capital city of the Segrià comarca, as well as the largest city in the province. It had 137,387 inhabitants , including the contiguous municipalities of Raimat and Sucs.\n\nLleida is one of the oldest towns in Catalonia, with recorded settlements dating back to the Bronze Age period. Until the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the area served as a settlement for an Iberian people, the Ilergetes. The town became a municipality, named Ilerda, under the reign of Augustus. It was reconquered in 1149, after being ruled by the Moors for many centuries, who had conquered the town in the 8th century. In 1297, the University of Lleida was founded, becoming the third oldest in the whole of Spain. During the following centuries, the town was damaged by several wars such as the Reapers' War in the 17th century and the Spanish Civil War in the 20th century. Since then, the city has been in a constant urban, commercial and demographic growth.\n\nHistory\n\nIn ancient times the city, named Iltrida and Ilerda, was the chief city of the Ilergetes, an Iberian tribe. Indíbil, king of the Ilergetes, and Mandoni, king of the Ausetanes, defended it against the Carthaginian and Roman invasions.\n\nUnder the Romans, the city was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, and was a place of considerable importance, historically as well as geographically. It stood upon an eminence, on the right (west) bank of the river Sicoris (the modern Segre), the principal tributary of the Ebre, and some distance above its confluence with the Cinga (modern Cinca); thus commanding the country between those rivers, as well as the great road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona), the provincial capital, to the northwest of Spain, which here crossed the Sicoris.Antonine Itinerary pp. 391, 452.\n\nIts situationTo quote Julius Caesar, \"propter ipsius loci opportunitatem\", Commentarii de Bello Civili i. 38. induced the legates of Pompey in Spain to make it the key of their defense against Caesar, in the first year of the Civil War (49 BCE). Afranius and Marcus Petreius threw themselves into the place with five legions; and their siege by Caesar himself (Battle of Ilerda), as narrated in his own words, forms one of the most interesting passages of military history. The resources exhibited by the great general, in a contest where the formation of the district and the very elements of nature seemed in league with his enemies, have been frequently extolled; but no epitome can do justice to the campaign. It ended by the capitulation of Afranius and Petreius, who were conquered as much by Caesar's generosity as by his strategy.Julius Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili i. 38, et seq.; Florus iv. 12; Appian, B.C. ii. 42; Velleius Paterculus ii. 42; Suetonius Caes. 34; Lucan, Pharsal. iv. 11, 144. In consequence of the battle, the Latin phrase Ilerdam videas is said to have been used by people who wanted to cast bad luck on someone else.\n\nUnder the Roman empire, Ilerda was a very flourishing city, and a municipium. It minted its own coins. It had a fine stone bridge over the Sicoris, (the bridge was so sturdy that its foundations support a bridge to this day). In the time of Ausonius the city had fallen into decay; but it rose again into importance in the Middle Ages.Strabo iii. p. 161; Horat. Epist. i. 20. 13; coins, ap. Florez, Med. ii. pp. 451, 646, iii. p. 73; Théodore Edme Mionnet, vol. i. p. 44, Suppl. vol. i. p. 89; Sestini, pp. 161, 166; Eckhel, vol. i. p. 51.\n\nIt was part of Visigothic and Muslim Hispania until it was conquered from the Moors by Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1149.\n\nIt used to be the seat of a major university, the oldest in the Crown of Aragon, until 1717, when it was moved by Philip V to the nearby town of Cervera. The University of Lleida is nowadays active again since 1991.\n\nDuring the Reapers' War, Lleida was occupied by the French and rebel forces. In 1644 the city was conquered by the Spanish under D. Felipe da Silva.\n\nLleida served as a key defense point for Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, and fell to the Insurgents, whose air forces bombed it extensively, in 1937 and 1938. The November 2, 1937 Legion Condor attacks against Lleida became especially infamous since they were aimed to the school known as Liceu Escolar de Lleida. 48 children and several teachers died in it that day, 300 people were killed on the November 2 bombings altogether, and the town would be bombed and sieged again in 1938, when it was conquered by Franco's forces.[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0037646 ] \n\nAfter some decades without any kind of population growth, it met a massive migration of Andalusians who helped the town undergo a relative demographic growth. Nowadays it is home to immigrants of 146 different nationalities.\n\nDuring 2007 Lleida was the year's Capital of Catalan Culture.\n\nClimate\n\nLleida has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk).[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s591939&cityname\nLleida%2C+Catalu%F1a%2C+Spain&units= Climate Summary for Lleida] Winters are mild and foggy though cooler than places on the coast while summers are hot and dry. Frosts are common during winter although snowfall can occasionally fall, averaging 1 or 2 days. Precipitation is low, with an annual average of 369 mm with a peak in April and May and another peak in September and October. \n\nDistricts and neighbourhoods\n\nLleida is divided in the following districts by the Observatori Socioeconòmic de Lleida:\n\n*Balàfia\n*Les Basses d'Alpicat\n*La Bordeta\n*Butsènit\n*Camp d'Esports\n*Cap Pont\n*Centre Històric\n*Ciutat Jardí\n*Humbert Torres\n*Instituts-Templers\n*Joc de la Bola\n*Llívia\n*Magraners\n*Mariola\n*Pardinyes\n*Príncep de Viana-Clot\n*Rambla Ferran-Estació\n*Secà de Sant Pere\n*Torres de Sanuí\n*Universitat\n\nCommunications and transport \n\nRailway\n\nLleida is served by the RENFE, Spanish state railway's Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line, serving Barcelona, Zaragoza, Calatayud, Guadalajara, and Madrid. Lleida has a new airport opened in January 2010, and a minor airfield located in Alfès. Also, the town is the western terminus of the Eix Transversal Lleida-Girona, and a railway covering the same distance (Eix Transversal Ferroviari) is currently under planning.\n\nLleida's only passenger railway station is Lleida Pirineus. It is served by both Renfe and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya train lines. In the future a Rodalies Lleida commuter network will connect the town with its adjacent area and the main towns of its province, improving the existing network with more train frequency and newly built infrastructure. A second railway station is Pla de la Vilanoveta in an industrial area, and only used by freight trains. A future railway museum will be located in its facilities.\nSince 2008 the bulk of public transport of the Lleida's surrounding area, mainly buses operated by several companies, is managed by Autoritat Territorial de la Mobilitat de l'Àrea de Lleida.\n\nBus\n\nThe urban buses, coloured yellow with blue stripes and owned by Autobusos de Lleida, include the following lines:\n*L-1 Interior\n*L-2 Ronda\n*L-3 Pardinyes\n*L-4 Mariola – Parc cientific i tecnologic\n*L-5 Bordeta\n*L-6 Magraners\n*L-7 Secà\n*L-8 Balàfia-Gualda\n*L-9 Hospitals\n*L-10 Exterior\n*L-11 Llívia-Caparrella\n*L-11B Llívia-Caparrella-Butsenit\n*L-12 C.Històric-Universitat\n*L-13 Cappont\n*L-14 Agrònoms\n*L-P Polígons\n*L-17 Bordeta-Ciutat Jardí\n*L-18 Palau de Congressos- Rambla de la Mercé\n*L-19 Butsenit\n*L-N Wonder (Regular night service)\n*L-Bus Turístic (tourist bus)\n*L- Aeroport\n*L- Llotja\n\nIn addition to these, there's a tourist bus and a regular night service to nearby clubs.\n\nLleida-Pirineus airport\n\nLleida has depended long time on nearby airports and had no local air transit. Lleida-Alguaire airport opened in 2010.\n\nFuture and planned services\n\nA tram-train system is pending approval. Using an existing but outdated passenger line, it would link Balaguer and Lleida, crossing both towns in a much-needed move towards better public transportation, both inner-city and between localities.http://www.transportpublic.org/images/pdf/20100118-balaguer1.pdf\n\nLanguages\n\nLleida is a traditionally Catalan-speaking city and province, with a characteristic dialect (known as Western or, more specifically, North-Western Catalan, or colloquially lleidatà). Most of the population is actively bilingual in Spanish.\n\nCulture\n\nLleida was the Capital of Catalan Culture in 2007.\n\nTheatre and music venues\n\nEnric Granados Auditorium is the city's concert hall and main music institution and conservatory.

Concerts are also a regular fixture of the two local feasts, Sant Anastasi in May, and Sant Miquel in September.\n\nFilm\n\nCaixaForum Lleida is the usual venue for film-related events and screenings. A Latin-American film festival is held yearly in the town (Mostra de Cinema Llatinoamericà de Lleida), and an animation film festival called Animac is held every May.\n\nArt and museums\n\nThe Lleida Museum opened in 2008 and displays historical artefacts and works of art from various periods. The Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs, a historically relevant building, exhibits both ancient and contemporary art. The Centre d'Art La Panera is a contemporary art institution. The Museu d'Art Jaume Morera displays art from the 20th and 21st centuries (as well as artwork by its namesake).\n\nThe city has a number of small municipal galleries, such as the Sala Municipal d'Exposicions de Sant Joan and the Sala Manel Garcia Sarramona.
