  "textBody" : "Kumquats (or cumquats in Australian English;; or) (Citrus japonica) are a group of small fruit-bearing trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae. They were previously classified as forming the now historical genus Fortunella, or placed within Citrus sensu lato.\n\nThe edible fruit closely resembles the orange (Citrus sinensis), but it is much smaller, being approximately the size and shape of a large olive. Kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus.\n\nName \n\nThe English name \"kumquat\" derives from the Cantonese gām-gwāt , literally meaning \"golden orange\" or \"golden tangerine\".\n\nThough loquats are not botanically related to kumquats, the terms derive from the same Chinese word for \"orange\".  Lou4gwat1, literally \"black orange\", originally referred to unripe kumquats, which are dark green, but due to a misunderstanding by poet Su Shi, Cantonese regions widely took up the new name for the non-citrus fruit known in Mandarin Chinese as a pipa.\n\nOrigin \n\nThe kumquat plant is native to south Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. The earliest historical reference to kumquats appears in literature of China in the 12th century. They have long been cultivated in India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and southeast Asia. They were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, collector for the London Horticultural Society, and shortly thereafter into North America.\n\nDescription \n\nThey are slow-growing evergreen shrubs or short trees, from  tall, with dense branches, sometimes bearing small thorns. The leaves are dark glossy green, and the flowers are white, similar to other citrus flowers, borne singly or clustered in the leaf-axils. Depending on size, the kumquat tree can produce hundreds or even thousands of fruits each year.\n\nVarieties \n\nRound kumquat \n\nWhen the kumquats are divided into multiple species, the name Fortunella japonica (or Citrus japonica) is retained by this group. The round kumquat also called Marumi kumquat or Morgani kumquat, is an evergreen tree, producing edible golden-yellow fruit. The round Hawaiian varietal, the \"Meiwa kumquat\", is eaten raw. The fruit is small and usually round but can be oval shaped. The peel has a sweet flavor but the fruit has a sour center. The fruit can be eaten cooked but is mainly used to make marmalades and jellies. It is grown as an ornamental plant and can be used in bonsai. The plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, where it is kept as a houseplant and given as a gift during the Lunar New Year. Round kumquats are more commonly cultivated than other species due to their cold tolerance.\n\nOval kumquat \n\nWhen the kumquats are divided into multiple species, the name Fortunella margarita (or Citrus margarita) is used for this group. The oval kumquat is also called the Nagami kumquat.[https://archive.is/20120712154023/http://coolexotics.com/plant-11-fortunella-margarita.html Fortunella margarita: oval kumquat, Nagami kumquat], coolexotics.com The unusual feature of the Nagami kumquat is in the eating of the fruit. The fruit is eaten whole, skin and all. The inside is still quite sour, but the skin has the sweeter flavour, when eaten together it produces an unusual tart-sweet, refreshing flavour. Fruit ripens mid to late winter and always crops very heavily, making a spectacular display against the dark green foliage. The tree is smaller growing and dwarf in nature, making it ideal for pots and has even been used in bonsai.\n\nJiangsu kumquat \n\nWhen the kumquats are divided into multiple species the name Fortunella obovata (or Citrus obovata) is used for this group. The Jiangsu kumquat or Fukushu kumquat bears edible fruit that can be eaten raw. The fruit can be made into jelly and marmalade. The fruit can be round or bell shaped; it is bright orange when fully ripe. It may be distinguished from other kumquats by its round leaves. It is grown for its edible fruit and as an ornamental plant. It cannot withstand frost. Kumquats are often seen near the Yuvraj section of the Nayak Province.\n\n'Centennial Variegated' kumquat \n\nThe 'Centennial Variegated' kumquat cultivar arose spontaneously from the Nagami kumquat. It produces a greater portion of fruit versus the thinner peel than the Nagami kumquat, and the fruit are also rounder and sometimes necked. Fruit are distinguishable by their variegation in color of green and yellow stripes. The tree is thornless.[http://www.citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus/centennial.html Centennial] at the Citrus Variety Collection\n*[http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/28/3/236.full.pdf ‘Centennial’ Variegated Kumquat Hybrid]\n\nCultivation and uses \n\nKumquats are cultivated in the Philippines, China, Chile, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Nepal, southern Pakistan, Iran, the Middle East, Europe (notably Corfu, Greece), and the United States (notably Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, California and Hawaii, but also Nevada, Arizona, and many areas throughout the Eastern U.S. and as far north as the Southern Midwest and barrier islands of Massachusetts.)\n\nThey are much hardier than other citrus plants such as oranges. The 'Nagami' kumquat requires a hot summer, ranging from 25 °C to 38 °C (77 °F to 100 °F), but can withstand frost down to about  without injury.\n\nIn cultivation in the UK, Citrus japonica has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).\n\nPropagation and pollination \n\nKumquats do not grow well from seeds and so are vegetatively propagated, using rootstock of another citrus fruit, air layering or cuttings (using a rooting gel/powder).  They are self-pollinating as are most citrus.\n\nComposition \n\nThe essential oil of kumquat peel contains much of the aroma of the fruit, and is composed principally of limonene, which makes up around 93% of the total.   Besides limonene and alpha-pinene (0.34%), both monoterpenes, the oil is unusually rich (0.38% total) in sesquiterpenes such as α-bergamotene (0.021%), caryophyllene (0.18%), α-humulene (0.07%) and α-muurolene (0.06%), and these contribute to the spicy and woody flavor of the fruit.  Carbonyl compounds make up much of the remainder, and these are responsible for much of the distinctive flavor. These compounds include esters such as isopropyl propanoate (1.8%) and terpinyl acetate (1.26%); ketones such as carvone (0.175%); and a range of aldehydes such as citronellal (0.6%) and 2-methylundecanal.  Other oxygenated compounds include nerol (0.22%) and trans-linalool oxide (0.15%).\n\nHybrids \n\nHybrid forms of the kumquat include the following:\n* Calamondin: mandarin orange x kumquat\n* Citrangequat: citrange x kumquat\n* Limequat: key lime x kumquat\n* Orangequat: Satsuma mandarin x kumquat\n* Procimequat: limequat x kumquat\n* Sunquat: lemon x kumquat\n* Yuzuquat: yuzu x kumquat\n\nFile:Hoa quất.jpg|Kumquat flower\nFile:Quinotos.jpg|Kumquat fruit cross-section\nFile:Kumquat.jpg|Kumquat whole and sectioned\nFile:Kumquat-0245.jpg|Common kumquat\nFile:Citrus japonica1.jpg|Round kumquats (or citrofortunella)\nFile:Một cành quất.jpg|Round kumquats (or citrofortunella)\nFile:KoumQuatLiqueur.jpg|Koum Quat liqueurs from Corfu, Greece\nFile:Kumquat Trees (Corfu).JPG|Potted kumquat trees at a kumquat liqueur distillery in Corfu.\nFile:Kumquat pie.JPG|Slices of kumquat pie at the Kumquat Festival in Dade City, Florida\nFile:Magical fruit.JPG|Bags of kumquat for sale at the Kumquat Festival\nFile:Kumquat jelly and kumquat butter.JPG|Kumquat Preserves\nFile:Fortunella (kumquat) 9 fiore+frutto.JPG|Flowers and fruit\nFile:Kumquat vert FR 2012.jpg|Green fruit and leaves\nFile:Citrus japonica3.jpg|Kumquat tree\nFile:Citrus japonica (4).JPG|Closeup from fruit in growth\nFile:Citrus japonica2.jpg|Kumquats in growth\nFile:Fortunella japonica Frutigen.jpg|Ready to pick\nFile:Citrus japonica (3).JPG|Ripening\nFile:Citrus japonica (6).JPG|Kumquat or kumquat hybrid",
