He was called the \"lesser\" or \"Locrian\" Ajax,Homer, Iliad [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D511  ii. 527] to distinguish him from Ajax the Great, son of Telamon. He was the leader of the Locrian contingent during the Trojan War.  He is a significant figure in Homer's Iliad and is also mentioned in the Odyssey, in  Virgil's Aeneid and in Euripides' The Trojan Women. In Etruscan legend, he was known as Aivas Vilates.\n\nLife\n\nAjax's mother's name was Eriopis.  According to Strabo, he was born in Naryx in Locris,Strabo, ix. p. 425 where Ovid calls him Narycius Heroes.Ovid, Metamorphoses xiv. 468  According to the Iliad,Homer, Iliad ii. 527, &c. he led his Locrians in forty ships against Troy.Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae 97 gives the number of ships as twenty  He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. In battle, he wore a linen cuirass (), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to Achilles, the swiftest of all the Greeks.Homer, Iliad xiv. 520, &c., xxiii. 789, &c.\n\nIn the funeral games at the pyre of Patroclus, Ajax contended with Odysseus and Antilochus for the prize in the footrace; but Athena, who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize.Homer, Iliad (xxiii. 754), &c. \n\nIn later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the nymph Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen.Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae 81, 97Bibliotheca iii. 10. § 8 After the taking of Troy, he rushed into the temple of Athena, where Cassandra had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess in supplication. Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives.Virgil, Aeneid ii. 403Euripides, Troad. 70, &c.Dict. Cret. v. 12Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae 116  According to some writers, he raped Cassandra inside the temple.Tryphiodorus, 635Quintus Smyrnaeus, xiii. 422Lycophron, 360, with the Scholion Odysseus called for Ajax's death by stoning for this crime, but Ajax saved himself by claiming innocence with an oath to Athena, clutching her statue in supplication.Pausanias, Description of Greece x. 26. § 1, 31. § 1\n\nDeath\n\nSince Ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple, Athena had cause to be indignant. According to the Bibliotheca, no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until Calchas, the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded Zeus to send a storm that sank many of their ships.\n\nAs he was returning from Troy, Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks (). but he escaped with some of his men, managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of Poseidon. He would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. Offended by this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his trident and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.Homer, Odyssey iv. 499, &c.

In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of Euboea, his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.comp.
