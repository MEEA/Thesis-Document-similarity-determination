The remaining two components of curl result from cyclic permutation of indices: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3 → 2,3,1.\n\nIntuitive interpretation\n\nSuppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow (such as a large tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.\n\nThe curl of the vector at any point is given  by the rotation of a infinitesimal area in the xy-plane(for z-axis component of the curl), zx-plane(for y-axis component of the curl) and yz-plane (for x-axis component of the curl vector). This can be clearly seen in the examples below.\n\nUsage \n\nIn practice, the above definition is rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl operator can be applied using some set of curvilinear coordinates, for which simpler representations have been derived.\n\nThe notation  has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional cross product, and it is useful as a mnemonic in Cartesian coordinates if  is taken as a vector differential operator del. Such notation involving operators is common in physics and algebra. However, in certain coordinate systems, such as polar-toroidal coordinates (common in plasma physics), using the notation  will yield an incorrect result.\n\nExpanded in Cartesian coordinates (see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations),  is, for  composed of :\n\n\\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\[5pt]\n{\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} & {\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} & {\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} \\\\[5pt]\nF_x & F_y & F_z \\end{vmatrix}\n\nwhere , , and  are the unit vectors for the -, -, and -axes, respectively. This expands as follows:Arfken, p. 43.\n\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right) \\mathbf{i} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x}\\right) \\mathbf{j} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\right) \\mathbf{k}\n\nAlthough expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.\n\nIn a general coordinate system, the curl is given by\n\n(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} )^k = \\varepsilon^{klm} \\nabla_l F_m\n\nwhere  denotes the Levi-Civita tensor and  the covariant derivative, the metric tensor is used to lower the index on , and the Einstein summation convention implies that repeated indices are summed over. Equivalently,\n\n(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} ) = \\mathbf{e}_k\\varepsilon^{klm} \\nabla_l F_m\n\nwhere  are the coordinate vector fields. Equivalently, using the exterior derivative, the curl can be expressed as:\n\n \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\left( \\star \\big( {\\mathbf d} F^\\flat \\big) \\right)^\\sharp \n\nHere  and  are the musical isomorphisms, and  is the Hodge dual. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of  in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any oriented three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a chiral operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.\n\nExamples\n\nA simple vector field\n\nTake the vector field, which depends on  and  linearly:\n\n\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=y\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}-x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}.\n\nIts plot looks like this:\n\nSimply by visual inspection, we can see that the field is rotating. If we place a paddle wheel anywhere (with the shaft pointing vertically into the picture), we see immediately its tendency to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, we expect the curl to be into the page. If we are to keep a right-handed coordinate system, into the page will be in the negative  direction. The lack of  and  directions is analogous to the cross product operation.\n\nIf we calculate the curl:\n\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} 0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ \\left({\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x) -{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} y\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n-2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n\nWhich is indeed in the negative  direction, as expected. In this case, the curl is actually a constant, irrespective of position. The \"amount\" of rotation in the above vector field is the same at any point . Plotting the curl of  is not very interesting:\n\nA more involved example\n\nSuppose we now consider a slightly more complicated vector field:\n\n\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=-x^2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}.\n\nIts plot:\n\nWe might not see any rotation initially, but if we closely look at the right, we see a larger field at, say,  than at . Intuitively, if we placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its right side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate clockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the negative  direction. By contrast, if we look at a point on the left and placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its left side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate counterclockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the positive  direction. Let's check out our guess by doing the math:\n\n{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{F} 0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x^2) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n-2x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}.\n\nIndeed, the curl is in the positive  direction for negative  and in the negative  direction for positive , as expected. Since this curl is not the same at every point, its plot is a bit more interesting:\n\nThe plot of this curl has no dependence on  or  (as it shouldn't) and is in the negative  direction for positive  and in the positive  direction for negative .\n\nIdentities\n\nIn general curvilinear coordinates (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields  and  can be shown to be\n\n\\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{v \\times F} \\right) = \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot F } \\right) + \\mathbf{F \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{v}- \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot v } \\right) + \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{F} \\ . \n\nInterchanging the vector field  and  operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:\n\n \\mathbf{v \\ \\times } \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\times F} \\right) =\\nabla_\\mathbf{F} \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot F } \\right) - \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla } \\right) \\mathbf{ F} \\ , \n\nwhere  is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field  (i.e., in this case,  is treated as being constant in space).\n\nAnother example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates\n\n \\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{\\nabla \\times F} \\right) = \\mathbf{\\nabla} (\\mathbf{\\nabla \\cdot F}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{F} \\ , \n\nand this identity defines the vector Laplacian of , symbolized as .\n\nThe curl of the gradient of any scalar field  is always the zero vector field\n\n\\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\varphi ) = \\boldsymbol{0}\n\nwhich follows from the antisymmetry in the definition of the curl, and the symmetry of second derivatives.\n\nIf  is a scalar valued function and  is a vector field, then\n\n\\nabla \\times ( \\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = \\nabla \\varphi \\times \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} \n\nDescriptive examples\n\n* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk, the curl has the same value at all points.\n* Of the four Maxwell's equations, two—Faraday's law and Ampère's law—can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and rate of change of the electric field.\n\nGeneralizations \n\nThe vector calculus operations of grad, curl, and div are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying bivectors (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the special orthogonal Lie algebra  of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3 × 3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and , these all being 3-dimensional spaces.\n\nDifferential forms \n\nIn 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function ; a differential 1-form is the following expression:\na_1\\,dx + a_2\\,dy + a_3\\,dz;\na differential 2-form is the formal sum:\na_{12}\\,dx\\wedge dy + a_{13}\\,dx\\wedge dz + a_{23}\\,dy\\wedge dz;\nand a differential 3-form is defined by a single term:\na_{123}\\,dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz.\n(Here the -coefficients are real functions; the \"wedge products\", e.g. , can be interpreted as some kind of oriented area elements, , etc.)\n\nThe exterior derivative of a -form in  is defined as the -form from above—and in  if, e.g.,\n\n\\omega^{(k)}=\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{i_1\n\nthen the exterior derivative  leads to\n\n d\\omega^{(k)}\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{j\n1} \\atop \\scriptstyle{i_1\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, e.g. because of\n\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\,\\partial x},\n\nthe twofold application of the exterior derivative leads to 0.\n\nThus, denoting the space of -forms by  and the exterior derivative by  one gets a sequence:\n\n0 \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^0(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^1(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^2(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^3(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, 0.\n\nHere  is the space of sections of the exterior algebra  vector bundle over ℝn, whose dimension is the binomial coefficient ; note that  for  or . Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of Pascal's triangle:\n\n0 → 1 → 3 → 3 → 1 → 0;\n\nthe 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.\n\nDifferential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold, -forms can be identified with -vector fields (-forms are -covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an oriented vector space with a nondegenerate form (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between -vectors and -vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange -forms, -vector fields, -forms, and -vector fields; this is known as Hodge duality. Concretely, on  this is given by:\n* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form  corresponds to the vector field .\n* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces  by the dual quantity  (i.e., omit ), and likewise, taking care of orientation:  corresponds to , and  corresponds to . Thus the form  corresponds to the \"dual form\" .\n\nThus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:\n* grad takes a function (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);\n* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a vector field (2-form);\n* div takes a vector field (2-form) to a function (3-form)\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that  corresponds to the identities\n\\nabla\\times(\\nabla f) = 0\nfor any function , and\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times\\mathbf v)=0\nfor any vector field .\n\nGrad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and -forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and -forms are always fiberwise -dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.\n\nCurl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are\n\n0 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 0;\n\nso the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a 2-vector field, which is fiberwise 6-dimensional, one has\n\n\\omega^{(2)}\\sum_{i\n\nwhich yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.\n\nHowever, one can define a curl of a vector field as a 2-vector field in general, as described below.\n\nCurl geometrically \n\n2-vectors correspond to the exterior power ; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the special orthogonal Lie algebra  of infinitesimal rotations. This has  dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) does , which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar – an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra .\n\nNote also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say  and ) is simply a vertical vector field (in the  direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.\n\nConsidering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609260 Generalizing Cross Products and Maxwell's Equations to Universal Extra Dimensions], A.W.

The lack of  and  directions is analogous to the cross product operation.\n\nIf we calculate the curl:\n\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} 0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ \\left({\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x) -{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} y\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n-2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n\nWhich is indeed in the negative  direction, as expected. In this case, the curl is actually a constant, irrespective of position. The \"amount\" of rotation in the above vector field is the same at any point . Plotting the curl of  is not very interesting:\n\nA more involved example\n\nSuppose we now consider a slightly more complicated vector field:\n\n\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=-x^2\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}.\n\nIts plot:\n\nWe might not see any rotation initially, but if we closely look at the right, we see a larger field at, say,  than at . Intuitively, if we placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its right side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate clockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the negative  direction. By contrast, if we look at a point on the left and placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its left side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate counterclockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the positive  direction. Let's check out our guess by doing the math:\n\n{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{F} 0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}+0\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}+ {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(-x^2) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}\n-2x\\boldsymbol{\\hat{z}}.\n\nIndeed, the curl is in the positive  direction for negative  and in the negative  direction for positive , as expected. Since this curl is not the same at every point, its plot is a bit more interesting:\n\nThe plot of this curl has no dependence on  or  (as it shouldn't) and is in the negative  direction for positive  and in the positive  direction for negative .\n\nIdentities\n\nIn general curvilinear coordinates (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields  and  can be shown to be\n\n\\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{v \\times F} \\right) = \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot F } \\right) + \\mathbf{F \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{v}- \\Big( \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\cdot v } \\right) + \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla} \\Big) \\mathbf{F} \\ . \n\nInterchanging the vector field  and  operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:\n\n \\mathbf{v \\ \\times } \\left( \\mathbf{ \\nabla \\times F} \\right) =\\nabla_\\mathbf{F} \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot F } \\right) - \\left( \\mathbf{v \\cdot \\nabla } \\right) \\mathbf{ F} \\ , \n\nwhere  is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field  (i.e., in this case,  is treated as being constant in space).\n\nAnother example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates\n\n \\nabla \\times \\left( \\mathbf{\\nabla \\times F} \\right) = \\mathbf{\\nabla} (\\mathbf{\\nabla \\cdot F}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{F} \\ , \n\nand this identity defines the vector Laplacian of , symbolized as .\n\nThe curl of the gradient of any scalar field  is always the zero vector field\n\n\\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\varphi ) = \\boldsymbol{0}\n\nwhich follows from the antisymmetry in the definition of the curl, and the symmetry of second derivatives.\n\nIf  is a scalar valued function and  is a vector field, then\n\n\\nabla \\times ( \\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = \\nabla \\varphi \\times \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} \n\nDescriptive examples\n\n* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk, the curl has the same value at all points.\n* Of the four Maxwell's equations, two—Faraday's law and Ampère's law—can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and rate of change of the electric field.\n\nGeneralizations \n\nThe vector calculus operations of grad, curl, and div are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying bivectors (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the special orthogonal Lie algebra  of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3 × 3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and , these all being 3-dimensional spaces.\n\nDifferential forms \n\nIn 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function ; a differential 1-form is the following expression:\na_1\\,dx + a_2\\,dy + a_3\\,dz;\na differential 2-form is the formal sum:\na_{12}\\,dx\\wedge dy + a_{13}\\,dx\\wedge dz + a_{23}\\,dy\\wedge dz;\nand a differential 3-form is defined by a single term:\na_{123}\\,dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz.\n(Here the -coefficients are real functions; the \"wedge products\", e.g. , can be interpreted as some kind of oriented area elements, , etc.)\n\nThe exterior derivative of a -form in  is defined as the -form from above—and in  if, e.g.,\n\n\\omega^{(k)}=\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{i_1\n\nthen the exterior derivative  leads to\n\n d\\omega^{(k)}\\sum_{\\scriptstyle{j\n1} \\atop \\scriptstyle{i_1\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, e.g. because of\n\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\,\\partial x},\n\nthe twofold application of the exterior derivative leads to 0.\n\nThus, denoting the space of -forms by  and the exterior derivative by  one gets a sequence:\n\n0 \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^0(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^1(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^2(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, \\Omega^3(\\mathbf{R}^3) \\, \\overset{d}{\\to} \\, 0.\n\nHere  is the space of sections of the exterior algebra  vector bundle over ℝn, whose dimension is the binomial coefficient ; note that  for  or . Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of Pascal's triangle:\n\n0 → 1 → 3 → 3 → 1 → 0;\n\nthe 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.\n\nDifferential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold, -forms can be identified with -vector fields (-forms are -covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an oriented vector space with a nondegenerate form (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between -vectors and -vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange -forms, -vector fields, -forms, and -vector fields; this is known as Hodge duality. Concretely, on  this is given by:\n* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form  corresponds to the vector field .\n* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces  by the dual quantity  (i.e., omit ), and likewise, taking care of orientation:  corresponds to , and  corresponds to . Thus the form  corresponds to the \"dual form\" .\n\nThus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:\n* grad takes a function (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);\n* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a vector field (2-form);\n* div takes a vector field (2-form) to a function (3-form)\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that  corresponds to the identities\n\\nabla\\times(\\nabla f) = 0\nfor any function , and\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times\\mathbf v)=0\nfor any vector field .\n\nGrad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and -forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and -forms are always fiberwise -dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.\n\nCurl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are\n\n0 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 0;\n\nso the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a 2-vector field, which is fiberwise 6-dimensional, one has\n\n\\omega^{(2)}\\sum_{i\n\nwhich yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.\n\nHowever, one can define a curl of a vector field as a 2-vector field in general, as described below.\n\nCurl geometrically \n\n2-vectors correspond to the exterior power ; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the special orthogonal Lie algebra  of infinitesimal rotations. This has  dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) does , which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar – an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra .\n\nNote also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say  and ) is simply a vertical vector field (in the  direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.\n\nConsidering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609260 Generalizing Cross Products and Maxwell's Equations to Universal Extra Dimensions], A.W.
