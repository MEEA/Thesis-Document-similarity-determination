  "textBody" : "The population of Indonesia according to the 2010 national census was 237.64 million, and it was estimated to reach 255.4 million in 2015. 58% live on the island of Java, the world's most populous island.\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967, for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise - become the world's third biggest country after China and India by 2043. Some say family planning should be revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country, but this aim has faced a hurdle of religiously-based opinion that to follow family planning is equivalent to not being grateful to God.\n\nIndonesia currently possess a relatively young population, thus implies a — potentially — large workforce and consumer base. Indonesia's total median age is 28.2 years (2011 estimate). This indicates that one half of the population is older than 28.2 years, while the other half is younger than this number.\n\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian (a form of Malay and the official national language) is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.\n\nPopulation\n\nPopulation by province\n\n[http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Indonesia-provinces-North-Kalimantan-Map.png]\n\nLargest cities\n\nAge structure\n\nIndonesia demographic composition has a relatively young population.

According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ID, ethnologue.com] the most widely spoken being  Javanese.\n\nA number of Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken.
