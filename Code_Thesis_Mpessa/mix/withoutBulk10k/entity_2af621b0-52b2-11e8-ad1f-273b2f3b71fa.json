  "textBody" : "Kashubian or Cassubian (Kashubian: ', ', '; , ', ') is a West Slavic language belonging to the Lechitic subgroup along with Polish and Silesian.Stephen Barbour, Cathie Carmichael, Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford University Press, 2000, p.199,  Although it is often considered a language in its own right, it is sometimes considered a dialect of Pomeranian. In Poland, it has been an officially recognized ethnic-minority language since 2005. Ministry of Interior of Poland Approximately 106,000 people use mainly Kashubian at home. It is the only remnant of the Pomeranian language. It is close to standard Polish with influence from Low German and the extinct Polabian and Old Prussian.\n\nOrigin\n\nKashubian is assumed to have evolved from the language spoken by some tribes of Pomeranians called Kashubians, in the region of Pomerania, on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea between the Vistula and Oder rivers. The Pomeranians were said to arrive before the Poles and certain tribes managed to maintain their language and traditions despite German and Polish settlements. It first diverged as its own language in the early 14th century.\n\nIn the 19th century, Florian Ceynowa became Kashubian's first known activist. He undertook tremendous efforts to awaken Kashubian self-identity through the establishment of Kashubian language, customs, and traditions. He felt strongly that Poles were born brothers and that Kashubia was a separate nation.\n\nThe Young Kashubian movement followed in 1912, led by author and doctor Aleksander Majkowski, who wrote for the paper \"Zrzësz Kaszëbskô\" as part of the \"Zrzëszincë\" group. The group contributed significantly to the development of the Kashubian literary language.\n\nThe earliest printed documents in Kashubian date from the end of the 16th century. The modern orthography was first proposed in 1879.\n\nRelated languages\n\nMany scholars and linguists debate whether Kashubian should be recognized as a Polish dialect or separate language. From the diachronic view it is a Lechitic West Slavic language  but from the synchronic point of view it is a Polish dialect. Kashubian is closely related to Slovincian, while both of them are dialects of Pomeranian. Many linguists, in Poland and elsewhere, consider it a divergent dialect of Polish. Dialectal diversity is so great within Kashubian that a speaker of southern dialects has considerable difficulty in understanding a speaker of northern dialects. The spelling and the grammar of Polish words written in Kashubian, which is most of its vocabulary, is highly unusual, making it difficult to comprehend also written text by native Polish speakers.[http://Finstytutkaszubski.republika.pl/pdfy_acta/Facta_2008_X_01-240.pdf Biuletin Radzëznë Kaszëbsczégò Jazëka rok 2007, Gduńsk.] Bibiografiô.\n\nLike Polish, Kashubian includes about 5% loanwords from German (such as ' \"art\"). Unlike Polish, these are mostly from Low German and only occasionally from High German.Anna Gliszczyńska. Germanizmy leksykalne południowej kaszubszczyzny (Na materiale książki Bolesława Jażdżewskiego Wspomnienia kaszubskiego \"gbura\"). \"LingVaria\". 1 (3), s. 79–89, 2007. Kraków: Uniwersytet Jagielloński. . Other sources of loanwords include the Baltic languages, Russian, and Polish.\nDue to soft pronunciation, the language is fairly similar to Belarusian.\n\nSpeakers\n\nThe number of speakers of Kashubian varies widely from source to source, ranging from as low as 4,500 to the upper 300,000. In the 2011 census, 106,000 people in Poland declared that they mainly use Kashubian at home. Of these only 10 percent consider Kashubian to be their mother tongue, with the rest considering themselves to be native speakers of both Kashubian and Polish. All Kashubian speakers are also fluent in Polish. A number of schools in Poland use Kashubian as a teaching language. It is an official alternative language for local administration purposes in Gmina Sierakowice, Gmina Linia, Gmina Parchowo, Gmina Luzino and Gmina Żukowo in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Most respondents say that Kashubian is used in informal speech among family members and friends. This is most likely because Polish is the official language and spoken in formal settings.\n\nIn the Americas\n\nDuring the Kashubian diaspora of 1855-1900, 115,700 Kashubians emigrated to North America, with around 15,000 emigrating to Brazil. Among the \"Polish\" community of Renfrew County, Ontario, Kashubian is widely spoken to this day, despite generations of Polonization at the hands of Polish parish priests. In Winona, Minnesota, which Ramult termed the \"Kashubian Capital of America\", Kashubian was regarded as \"poor Polish,\" as opposed to the \"good Polish\" of the parish priests and teaching sisters. Consequently, Kashubian failed to survive Polonization and died out shortly after the mid-20th century.\n\nLiterature\n\nImportant for Kashubian literature was Xążeczka dlo Kaszebov by Doctor Florian Ceynowa (1817–1881).http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/slavic_eurasia_papers/no3/06_Treder.pdf Hieronim Derdowski (1852–1902 in Winona, Minnesota) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Doctor Aleksander Majkowski (1876–1938) from Kościerzyna, who wrote the Kashubian national epic The Life and Adventures of Remus. Jan Trepczyk was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was Stanisław Pestka. Kashubian literature has been translated into Czech, Polish, English, German, Belarusian, Slovene and Finnish. Aleksander Majkowski and Alojzy Nagel belong to the most commonly translated Kashubian authors of the 20th century. A considerable body of Christian literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the New Testament, much of it by Fr. Adam Ryszard Sikora (OFM). Rev. Franciszek GruczaPeter Hauptmann, Günther Schulz, Kirche im Osten: Studien zur osteuropäischen Kirchengeschichte und Kirchenkunde, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2000, pp.44ff,  [https://books.google.com/books?idqHL3-GAJE-YC&pg\nPA45&dqslowinzen&as_brr\n3&client=firefox-a#PPA44,M1] graduated from a Catholic seminary in Pelplin. He was the first priest to introduce Catholic liturgy in Kashubian language.\n\nWorks \n\nThe earliest recorded artifacts of Kashubian date back to the 15th century and include a book of spiritual psalms that were used to introduce Kashubian to the Lutheran church: \n* 1586  Duchowne piesnie (Spiritual songs) D. Marcina Luthera y ynßich naboznich męzow. Zniemieckiego w Slawięsky ięzik wilozone Przes Szymana Krofea... w Gdainsku: przes Jacuba Rhode, Tetzner 1896: translated from pastorks. S. Krofeja, Słowińca (?) rodem z Dąbia. \nThe next few texts are also religious catechisms but this time from the Catholic church because of majority of Kashubians were Roman Catholic and these texts helped them become more unified in faith:\n* 1643 Mały Catechism (Little Catechism) D.

Kashubian was represented as folklore and prevented from being taught in schools. Following the collapse of communism, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It has been included in the program of school education in Kashubia although not as a language of teaching or as a required subject for every child, but as a foreign language taught 3 hours per week at parents' explicit request. Since 1991, it is estimated that there have been around 17,000 students in over 400 schools who have learned Kashubian. Kashubian has some limited usage on public radio and had on public television. Since 2005, Kashubian has enjoyed legal protection in Poland as an official regional language. It is the only language in Poland with that status, which was granted by the Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Language of the Polish Parliament. The act provides for its use in official contexts in ten communes in which speakers are at least 20% of the population.G. Stone: Slav outposts in Central European history : the Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs, London, UK : Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2016, p. 348 The recognition means that heavily- populated Kashubian localities have been able to have road signs and other amenities with Polish and Kashubian translations on them.\n\nDialects\n\nFriedrich Lorentz wrote in the early 20th century that there were three Kashubian dialects. These include the\n* Northern Kashubian dialect \n* Middle Kashubian dialect\n* Southern Kashubian dialect\n\nOther researches would argue that each tiny region of the Kaszuby has its own dialect, as in Dialects and Slang of Poland: \n* Bylacki dialect\n* Slowinski dialect \n* Kabatkow dialect\n* Zaborski dialect \n* Tucholski and Krajniacki dialect (althoughouse both dialects would be considered a transitional form of the Wielkopolski dialect and are included as official Wielkopolskie dialects.\n\nFeatures\n\nA \"standard\" Kashubian language does not exist despite several attempts to create one; rather a diverse range of dialects takes its place. The vocabulary is heavily influenced by German and Polish and uses the Latin alphabet.\n\nThere are several similarities between Kashubian and Polish. For some linguists they consider this a sign that Kashubian is a dialect of Polish but others believe that this is just a sign that the two originate from the same location. They are nevertheless related to a certain degree and their proximity has made Kashubian influenced by Polish and its various dialects, specifically its northern ones.\n\nSome examples of similarities between languages:\n* softening of the consonant ' inflections of northern Kashubian dialects: ex: Northern Kashubian: ', '; Polish: ', '\n* the disappearance of a movable ' in the nominative case: ex: ', '; ', '\n* vowel  takes the place of long ' as it did for Early Slavs, similar changes took place in early dialects of Polish\n* transition of ' to ' just like the Masurian dialect: ex: '; '\n\nPhonology and morphology\n\nKashubian makes use of simplex and complex phonemes with secondary place articulation,,, and. They follow the Clements and Hume (1995) constriction model, where sounds are represented in terms of constriction. They are then organized according to particular features like anterior, implying the activation of features dominating it. Due to this model, the phonemes above are treated differently from the phonemes,,, and. The vocalic place node would be placed under the C-place node and V-place nodes interpolated to preserve well-forwardness.\n\nVowels\n\n* The exact phonetic realization of the close-mid vowels depends on the dialect.\n* Apart from these, there are also nasal vowels. Their exact phonetic realization depends on the dialect.\n\nConsonants\n\nKashubian has simple consonants with a secondary articulation along with complex ones with secondary articulation.\n\n* are palato-alveolar.\n* are alveolo-palatal; the last four appear only in some dialects.\n* The fricative trill is used only by some northern and northeastern speakers; other speakers realize it as flat postalveolar.\n* The labialized velar central approximant is realized as a velarized denti-alveolar lateral approximant by older speakers of southeastern dialects.\n\nKashubian alphabet\n\nThe following digraphs and trigraphs are used:\n\nSamples\n\n*Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Kashubian:\n\nWszëtczi lëdze rodzą sã wòlny ë równy w swòji czëstnoce ë swòjich prawach.
