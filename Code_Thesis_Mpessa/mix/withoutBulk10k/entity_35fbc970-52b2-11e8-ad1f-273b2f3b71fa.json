Accessdate on 31 October 2007.Copi and CohenHurleyMoore and Parker (or modus tollendo tollens and also denying the consequent) (Latin for \"the way that denies by denying\") is a valid argument form and a rule of inference.  It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its contra-positive.\n\nThe first to explicitly describe the argument form modus tollens were the Stoics.[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#StoSyl \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Ancient Logic: The Stoics\"]\n\nThe inference rule modus tollens validates the inference from P implies Q and the contradictory of Q to the contradictory of P.\n\nThe modus tollens rule can be stated formally as:\n\n\\frac{P \\to Q, \\neg Q}{\\therefore \\neg P}\n\nwhere P \\to Q stands for the statement \"P implies Q\". \\neg  Q stands for \"it is not the case that Q\" (or in brief \"not Q\"). Then, whenever \"P \\to Q\" and \"\\neg Q\" each appear by themselves as a line of a proof, then \"\\neg P\" can validly be placed on a subsequent line. The history of the inference rule modus tollens  goes back to antiquity.Susanne Bobzien (2002). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156852802321016541 \"The Development of Modus Ponens in Antiquity\"], Phronesis 47.\n\nModus tollens is closely related to modus ponens. There are two similar, but invalid, forms of argument: affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent.  See also contraposition and proof by contrapositive.\n\nFormal notation \n\nThe modus tollens rule may be written in sequent notation:\n\nP\\to Q, \\neg Q \\vdash \\neg P\n\nwhere \\vdash is a metalogical symbol meaning that \\neg P is a syntactic consequence of P \\to Q and \\neg Q in some logical system;\n\nor as the statement of a functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:\n\n((P \\to Q) \\and \\neg Q) \\to \\neg P\n\nwhere P and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system;\n\nor including assumptions:\n\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash P\\to Q ~~~ \\Gamma \\vdash \\neg Q}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\neg P}\nthough since the rule does not change the set of assumptions, this is not strictly necessary.\n\nMore complex rewritings involving modus tollens are often seen, for instance in set theory:\n\nP\\subseteq Q\nx\\notin Q\n\\therefore x\\notin P\n(\"P is a subset of Q. x is not in Q. Therefore, x is not in P.\")\n\nAlso in first-order predicate logic:\n\n\\forall x:~P(x) \\to Q(x)\n\\exists x:~\\neg Q(x)\n\\therefore \\exists x:~\\neg P(x)\n(\"For all x if x is P then x is Q. There exists some x that is not Q. Therefore, there exists some x that is not P.\")\n\nStrictly speaking these are not instances of modus tollens, but they may be derived from modus tollens using a few extra steps.\n\nExplanation \n\nRequirements:\n# The argument has two premises.\n# The first premise is a conditional or \"if-then\" statement, for example that if P then Q.\n# The second premise is that it is not the case that Q.\n# From these two premises, it can be logically concluded that it is not the case that P.\n\nConsider an example:\nIf the watch-dog detects an intruder, the watch-dog will bark.\nThe watch-dog did not bark.\nTherefore, no intruder was detected by the watch-dog.\n\nSupposing that the premises are both true (the dog will bark if it detects an intruder, and does indeed not bark), it follows that no intruder has been detected. This is a valid argument since it is not possible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. (It is conceivable that there may have been an intruder that the dog did not detect, but that does not invalidate the argument; the first premise is \"if the watch-dog detects an intruder.\" The thing of importance is that the dog detects or does not detect an intruder, not whether there is one.)\n\nAnother example:\nIf I am the axe murderer, then I can use an axe.\nI cannot use an axe.\nTherefore, I am not the axe murderer.\n\nAnother example: \nIf Rex is a chicken, then he is a bird.\nRex is not a bird.\nTherefore, Rex is not a chicken.\n\nRelation to modus ponens \n\nEvery use of modus tollens can be converted to a use of modus ponens and one use of transposition to the premise which is a material implication. For example:\n\nIf P, then Q. (premise – material implication)\nIf not Q , then not P. (derived by transposition)\nNot Q . (premise)\nTherefore, not  P. (derived by modus ponens)\n\nLikewise, every use of modus ponens can be converted to a use of modus tollens and transposition.\n\nJustification via truth table \n\nThe validity of modus tollens can be clearly demonstrated through a truth table.\n\nIn instances of modus tollens we assume as premises that p → q is true and q is false. There is only one line of the truth table—the fourth line—which satisfies these two conditions. In this line, p is false. Therefore, in every instance in which p → q is true and q is false, p must also be false.\n\nFormal proof \n\nVia disjunctive syllogism \n\nVia reductio ad absurdum \n\nVia contraposition \n\nCorrespondence to other mathematical frameworks\n\nProbability calculus\n\nModus tollens represents an instance of the Law of total probability combined with Bayes' theorem expressed as:\n\n\\Pr(P)=\\Pr(P\\mid Q)\\Pr(Q)+\\Pr(P\\mid \\lnot Q)\\Pr(\\lnot Q)\\,,\n\nwhere the conditionals \\Pr(P\\mid Q) and \\Pr(P\\mid \\lnot Q) are obtained with (the extended form of) Bayes' theorem expressed as:\n\n\\Pr(P\\mid Q) \\frac{\\Pr(Q \\mid P)\\,a(P)}{\\Pr(Q\\mid P)\\,a(P)+\\Pr(Q\\mid \\lnot P)\\,a(\\lnot P)}\\;\\;\\; and  \\;\\;\\;\\Pr(P\\mid \\lnot Q) \n \\frac{\\Pr(\\lnot Q \\mid P)\\,a(P)}{\\Pr(\\lnot Q\\mid P)\\,a(P)+\\Pr(\\lnot Q\\mid \\lnot P)\\,a(\\lnot P)}.\n\nIn the equations above \\Pr(Q) denotes the probability of Q, and a(P) denotes the base rate (aka. prior probability) of P. The conditional probability \\Pr(Q\\mid P) generalizes the logical statement P \\to Q, i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE we can also assign any probability to the statement. Assume that \\Pr(Q) 1 is equivalent to Q being TRUE, and that \\Pr(Q) \n 0 is equivalent to Q being FALSE.  It is then easy to see that \\Pr(P) 0 when \\Pr(Q\\mid P) \n 1 and \\Pr(Q) 0. This is because \\Pr(\\lnot Q\\mid P) \n 1 - \\Pr(Q\\mid P) 0 so that \\Pr(P\\mid \\lnot Q) \n 0 in the last equation. Therefore, the product terms in the first equation always have a zero factor so that \\Pr(P) = 0 which is equivalent to P being FALSE. Hence, the law of total probability combined with Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of modus tollens Audun Jøsang 2016:p.2.\n\nSubjective logic\n\nModus tollens represents an instance of the abduction operator in subjective logic expressed as:\n\n\\omega^{A}_{P\\tilde{\\|}Q}= (\\omega^{A}_{Q|P},\\omega^{A}_{Q|\\lnot P})\\widetilde{\\circledcirc} (a_{P},\\,\\omega^{A}_{Q})\\,,\n\nwhere \\omega^{A}_{Q} denotes the subjective opinion about Q, and (\\omega^{A}_{Q|P},\\omega^{A}_{Q|\\lnot P}) denotes a pair of binomial conditional opinions, as expressed by source A. The parameter a_{P} denotes the base rate (aka. the prior probability) of P. The abduced marginal opinion on P is denoted \\omega^{A}_{P\\tilde{\\|}Q}. The conditional opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q|P} generalizes the logical statement P \\to Q, i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE the source A can assign any subjective opinion to the statement. The case where \\omega^{A}_{Q} is an absolute TRUE opinion is equivalent to source A saying that Q is TRUE, and the case where \\omega^{A}_{Q} is an absolute FALSE opinion is equivalent to source A saying that Q is FALSE.  The abduction operator \\widetilde{\\circledcirc} of subjective logic produces an absolute FALSE abduced opinion \\omega^{A}_{P\\widetilde{\\|}Q} when the conditional opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q|P} is absolute TRUE and the consequent opinion \\omega^{A}_{Q} is absolute FALSE.
