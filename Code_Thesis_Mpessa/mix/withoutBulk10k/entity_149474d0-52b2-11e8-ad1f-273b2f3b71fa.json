  "textBody" : "Hasid (, \"pious\"; plural \"Hasidim\", חסידים) is a Jewish honorific, frequently used as a term of exceptional respect in the Talmudic and early medieval periods. In classic Rabbinic literature it differs from \"Tzadik\"-\"righteous\", by instead denoting one who goes beyond the legal requirements of ritual and ethical Jewish observance in daily life. The literal meaning of \"Hasid\" derives from Chesed-\"kindness\", the outward expression of love for God and other people. This spiritual devotion motivates pious conduct beyond everyday limits. The devotional nature of its description lent itself to a few Jewish movements in history being known as \"Hasidim\".
