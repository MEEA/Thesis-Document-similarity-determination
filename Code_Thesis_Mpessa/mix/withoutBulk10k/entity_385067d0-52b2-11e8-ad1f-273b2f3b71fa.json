This compares with about 32 per square kilometre (85 per square mile) for the United States. A census (held every 10 years) was held in November 2005.\n\nInhabited since prehistoric times, Malta was first colonized by Sicilians. Subsequently, Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs in 870 CEThe Arabs in Malta / G. Wettinger. In: Malta: Studies of its Heritage and History / ed. Mid-Med Bank (Malta, 1986), pp. 87-104.  who may have completely depopulated the islandsIbn Hauqal and Tenth-century Malta / A. Luttrell.

Both languages are compulsory subjects in Maltese primary and secondary schools. A large portion of the population is also fluent in Italian, which was, until 1936, the national language of Malta. The literacy rate has reached 93%, compared to 63% in 1946. Schooling is compulsory until age 16.\n\nAge distribution\n\nSince 2000, the shift in the age composition towards an older population continued to materialise. In fact, the average age of the Maltese population increased from 38.5 in 2005 to 40.5 in 2011. This resulted from the increase in the number of persons aged 55 and over, together with a decrease in the number of persons under 25 years of age. The average in Gozo and Comino (41.6 years) was higher than that observed for Malta.\nPersons aged 65 and over more represent 16.3% of the total population in 2011, compared to 13.7% in 2005. In contrast, persons aged 14 and under make up 14.8% of the population in 2011, compared to 17.2% in 2005.\n\nMigrant background and foreign nationality \n\nForeign nationals in Malta\n\nAs of 2016 and 2017, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Malta were as follows:\n\nThis list does not include foreigners with Maltese nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\nEmigration \n\nMalta has long been a country of emigration, with big Maltese communities in English-speaking countries abroad.\nMass emigration picked up in the 19th century, reaching its peak in the decades after World War II. \n\nIn the nineteenth century, most migration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East (particularly Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt), although rates of return migration to Malta were high. Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in Tunisia.\nThere is little trace left of the Maltese communities in North Africa, most of them having been displaced, after the rise of independence movements, to places like Marseille, the United Kingdom or Australia. \n\nAfter World War II, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States. (See also Maltese Australians; Maltese people in the United Kingdom)\n\n46,998 Maltese-born residents were recorded by the 2001 Australian Census, 30,178 by the 2001 UK Census, 9,525 by the 2001 Canadian Census and 9,080 by the 2000 United States Census.\n\nEmigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg. At the same time, Malta is becoming more and more attractive for communities of immigrants, both from Western and Northern Europe (Italians, Brits) and from Eastern Europe (Serbs).\n\nImmigration \n\nMost of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on Sliema and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, French, and Lebanese, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe.\nAs a member of the European Union and of the Schengen agreement, Malta is bound by the Dublin Regulation to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.\n\nIrregular migrants (formal Maltese: immigranti irregolari, informal: klandestini) who land in Malta are subject to a compulsory detention policy, being held in several camps organised by the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM), including those near Ħal Far and Ħal Safi. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Malta's detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nVery few migrants arrived in Malta in 2015, despite the fact that the rest Europe is experiencing a migrant crisis. Most migrants who were rescued between Libya and Malta were taken to Italy, and some refused to be brought to Malta.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nLargest Cities:\n*Birkirkara\n*Mosta\n*Qormi\n*Żabbar\n*San Pawl il-Baħar\n*Sliema\n*San Ġwann\n*Rabat\n*Żejtun\n*Naxxar\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population:\n79.01 years\nmale:\n76.83 years\nfemale:\n81.31 years (2006 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n1.5 children born/woman (2006 est.)\n\nReligions:\nRoman Catholic Church in Malta 98%\n\nLanguages:\nMaltese (official de facto), English (official de jure), Italian (widely understood)\n\nVital statistics\n\nStatistics from United Nations and National Statistics Office Malta\n\nCensus per locality, 1901-2011Census of population and housing 2011, Final Report, p.3 \n\nColors=\n  id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9)\n  id:darkgrey  value:gray(0.8)\n  id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1)\n  id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8)\n\nImageSize  = width:455 height:303\nPlotArea   = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30\nDateFormat = x.y\nPeriod     = from:0 till:500000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nAlignBars  = justify\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:50000 start:0\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:10000 start:0\nBackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo\n\nBarData=\n  bar:1901 text:1901\n  bar:1911 text:1911\n  bar:1921 text:1921\n  bar:1931 text:1931\n  bar:1948 text:1948\n  bar:1957 text:1957\n  bar:1967 text:1967\n  bar:1985 text:1985\n  bar:1995 text:1995\n  bar:2005 text:2005\n  bar:2011 text:2011\n\nPlotData=\n  color:barra width:20 align:left\n  bar:1901 from: 0 till:184742\n  bar:1911 from: 0 till:211564\n  bar:1921 from: 0 till:212258\n  bar:1931 from: 0 till:241621\n  bar:1948 from: 0 till:305991\n  bar:1957 from: 0 till:319620\n  bar:1967 from: 0 till:314216\n  bar:1985 from: 0 till:345418\n  bar:1995 from: 0 till:378132\n  bar:2005 from: 0 till:404962\n  bar:2011 from: 0 till:417432\n\nPlotData=\n\n  bar:1901 at:184742 fontsize:XS text: 184742 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1911 at:211564 fontsize:XS text: 211564 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1921 at:212258 fontsize:XS text: 212258 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1931 at:241621 fontsize:XS text: 241621 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1948 at:305991 fontsize:XS text: 305991 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1957 at:319620 fontsize:XS text: 319620 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1967 at:314216 fontsize:XS text: 314216 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1985 at:345418 fontsize:XS text: 345418 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1995 at:378132 fontsize:XS text: 378132 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:2005 at:404962 fontsize:XS text: 404962 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:2011 at:417432 fontsize:XS text: 417432 shift:(-8,5)\n\nTextData=\n  fontsize:S pos:(20,20)\n  text:Census data\n\nNotes:\n#  Gżira shown as a separate locality since 1948.\n#  New locality of Msieraħ (San Ġwann) constituted from parts of Birkirkara and St Julian's and is shown as separate locality in 1967.\n#  New locality of Fgura constituted from parts of Paola, Ħal Tarxien and Ħaż‐Żabbar in 1967.\n#  Marsaskala shown as a separate locality since 1957.\n#  New locality of Munxar constituted from parts of Ta' Sannat and Fontana till 1957.\n#  New locality of Fontana shown as separate locality till 1967.\n#  Gwardamangia formed part of Ħamrun in 1967.\n#  Tal‐Pietà formed part of Msida in 1967.\n#  Santa Luċija formed part of Ħal Tarxien and Paola till 1967.\n#  Ta' Xbiex formed part of Msida and Gżira till 1967.\n#  Pembroke formed part of St Julian's till 1985.\n#  Swieqi formed part of St Julian's till 1985.\n#  Xgħajra formed part of Ħaż‐Żabbar till 1985.\n#  Iklin formed part of Ħal Lija, Birkirkara, Naxxar and San Ġwann till 1985.\n#  Mtarfa formed part of Rabat till 1995.\n#  The boundaries of some localities were changed between 1995 and 2005.",

Most migrants who were rescued between Libya and Malta were taken to Italy, and some refused to be brought to Malta.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nLargest Cities:\n*Birkirkara\n*Mosta\n*Qormi\n*Żabbar\n*San Pawl il-Baħar\n*Sliema\n*San Ġwann\n*Rabat\n*Żejtun\n*Naxxar\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population:\n79.01 years\nmale:\n76.83 years\nfemale:\n81.31 years (2006 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n1.5 children born/woman (2006 est.)\n\nReligions:\nRoman Catholic Church in Malta 98%\n\nLanguages:\nMaltese (official de facto), English (official de jure), Italian (widely understood)\n\nVital statistics\n\nStatistics from United Nations and National Statistics Office Malta\n\nCensus per locality, 1901-2011Census of population and housing 2011, Final Report, p.3 \n\nColors=\n  id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9)\n  id:darkgrey  value:gray(0.8)\n  id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1)\n  id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8)\n\nImageSize  = width:455 height:303\nPlotArea   = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30\nDateFormat = x.y\nPeriod     = from:0 till:500000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nAlignBars  = justify\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:50000 start:0\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:10000 start:0\nBackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo\n\nBarData=\n  bar:1901 text:1901\n  bar:1911 text:1911\n  bar:1921 text:1921\n  bar:1931 text:1931\n  bar:1948 text:1948\n  bar:1957 text:1957\n  bar:1967 text:1967\n  bar:1985 text:1985\n  bar:1995 text:1995\n  bar:2005 text:2005\n  bar:2011 text:2011\n\nPlotData=\n  color:barra width:20 align:left\n  bar:1901 from: 0 till:184742\n  bar:1911 from: 0 till:211564\n  bar:1921 from: 0 till:212258\n  bar:1931 from: 0 till:241621\n  bar:1948 from: 0 till:305991\n  bar:1957 from: 0 till:319620\n  bar:1967 from: 0 till:314216\n  bar:1985 from: 0 till:345418\n  bar:1995 from: 0 till:378132\n  bar:2005 from: 0 till:404962\n  bar:2011 from: 0 till:417432\n\nPlotData=\n\n  bar:1901 at:184742 fontsize:XS text: 184742 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1911 at:211564 fontsize:XS text: 211564 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1921 at:212258 fontsize:XS text: 212258 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1931 at:241621 fontsize:XS text: 241621 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1948 at:305991 fontsize:XS text: 305991 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1957 at:319620 fontsize:XS text: 319620 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1967 at:314216 fontsize:XS text: 314216 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1985 at:345418 fontsize:XS text: 345418 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:1995 at:378132 fontsize:XS text: 378132 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:2005 at:404962 fontsize:XS text: 404962 shift:(-8,5)\n  bar:2011 at:417432 fontsize:XS text: 417432 shift:(-8,5)\n\nTextData=\n  fontsize:S pos:(20,20)\n  text:Census data\n\nNotes:\n#  Gżira shown as a separate locality since 1948.\n#  New locality of Msieraħ (San Ġwann) constituted from parts of Birkirkara and St Julian's and is shown as separate locality in 1967.\n#  New locality of Fgura constituted from parts of Paola, Ħal Tarxien and Ħaż‐Żabbar in 1967.\n#  Marsaskala shown as a separate locality since 1957.\n#  New locality of Munxar constituted from parts of Ta' Sannat and Fontana till 1957.\n#  New locality of Fontana shown as separate locality till 1967.\n#  Gwardamangia formed part of Ħamrun in 1967.\n#  Tal‐Pietà formed part of Msida in 1967.\n#  Santa Luċija formed part of Ħal Tarxien and Paola till 1967.\n#  Ta' Xbiex formed part of Msida and Gżira till 1967.\n#  Pembroke formed part of St Julian's till 1985.\n#  Swieqi formed part of St Julian's till 1985.\n#  Xgħajra formed part of Ħaż‐Żabbar till 1985.\n#  Iklin formed part of Ħal Lija, Birkirkara, Naxxar and San Ġwann till 1985.\n#  Mtarfa formed part of Rabat till 1995.\n#  The boundaries of some localities were changed between 1995 and 2005.
