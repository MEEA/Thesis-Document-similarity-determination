  "textBody" : "Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; see below) is a Christian sacrament of admission and adoption,St. Paul: Romans 8:15 \"the spirit of adoption\" (\"of sonship\" RSV), Galatians 4:5 \"adoption of sons\", Ephesians 1:15 \"the adoption of children by Jesus Christ\" (\"to be his sons through Jesus Christ\" RSV). almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally.For example, \"baptized in the Catholic Church\" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Second Vatican Council, Lumen gentium, 28]  The canonical Gospels report that Jesus was baptized, , —a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Baptism has been called a holy sacrament and an ordinance of Jesus Christ. In some denominations, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word \"christening\" is reserved for the baptism of infants. Baptism has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.\n\nThe usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the candidate to be immersed, either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). While John the Baptist's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, \"The fact that he chose a permanent and deep river suggests that more than a token quantity of water was needed, and both the preposition 'in' (the Jordan) and the basic meaning of the verb 'baptize' probably indicate immersion. In v. 16, Matthew will speak of Jesus 'coming up out of the water'.  Phillip and the Eunuch also went down and came up out of water (Acts 8:38-39).  Baptism is likened unto a burial in Romans 6:3. \"Dip\" is translated from baptō ().  The traditional depiction in Christian art of John the Baptist pouring water over Jesus' head may therefore be based on later Christian practice.\" Pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body.  Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead, a method called affusion.\n\nMartyrdom was identified early in Church history as \"baptism by blood\", enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire, by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of infant baptism, baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense necessary for salvation, until Huldrych Zwingli in the 16th century denied its necessity.\n\nQuakers and The Salvation Army practice Baptism with the Holy Spirit instead of baptism with water. Among denominations that practice baptism by water, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" (following the Great Commission), but some baptize in Jesus' name only. Much more than half of all Christians baptize infants; many others hold that only believer's baptism is true baptism. Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient. The term \"baptism\" has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word baptism is derived indirectly through Latin from the neuter Greek concept noun baptisma (Greek , \"washing-ism\"),, , , . The several Greek words from which the English word baptism has been formed are used by Greek writers (in classical antiquity, in the Septuagint, and in the New Testament) with a great latitude of meaning, including \"to make Christian\" and \"baptisma pyros (baptism of fire)\" — [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P1992.html The University of Texas at Austin, College of Liberal Arts, Linguistics Research Center, Indo-European Lexicon, PIE (Proto-Indo-European) Etymon and IE (Indo-European) Reflexes: \"baptism\"] [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0414.html and \"baptize\"], [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0703.html Greek baptein, baptizein, baptos] — [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm#II New Advent, Catholic Encyclopedia: \"Baptism\": Etymology] — [http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Theological_Terms/A_Prior_%20to_Born_Again.htm Spirit Restoration, Theological Terms: A to B Dictionary: \"baptize\"] (scroll down to \"baptism\") — [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term\nbaptize Online Etymological Dictionary: \"baptize\"] — [http://bibleencyclopedia.com/baptism.htm International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: \"baptism\"] — two parallel online sources, Search God's Word and Eliyah, for \"Strong's numbers\":  [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number907 Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible:  Greek Lexicon 907 βαπτίζω \"baptize\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file\ngreeklexicon&isindex907 907 baptizo \"baptize\"], [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number\n908 908 βάπτισμα \"baptism\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?filegreeklexicon&isindex\n908 908 baptisma \"baptism\"], [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number909 909 βαπτισμός \"baptisms\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file\ngreeklexicon&isindex909 909 baptismos \"baptisms\"], and [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number\n910  910 βαπτστἠς \"baptist\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?filegreeklexicon&isindex\n910  910 baptistes \"baptist\"].  which is a neologism in the New Testament derived from the masculine Greek noun baptismos (), a term for ritual washing in Greek language texts of Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period, such as the Septuagint. Both of these nouns are derived from the verb baptizō (, \"I wash\" transitive verb), which is used in Jewish texts for ritual washing, and in the New Testament both for ritual washing and also for the apparently new rite of baptisma. The Greek verb baptō (), \"dip\", from which the verb baptizo is derived, is in turn hypothetically traced to a reconstructed Indo-European root *gʷabh-, \"dip\".American Heritage Dictionary of the English language, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4IHbQgz1nZYC&lpg=PA33 page 33].  The Greek words are used in a great variety of meanings.\n\nHistory\n\nBaptism has similarities to Tvilah, a Jewish purification ritual of immersing in water, which is required for, among other things, conversion to Judaism, but which differs in being repeatable, while baptism is to be performed only once. (In fact, the Modern Hebrew term for \"baptism\" is \"Christian Tvilah\".) John the Baptist, who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement.sacrament (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 20, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515366/sacrament The apostle Paul distinguished between the baptism of John, (\"baptism of repentance\") and baptism in the name of Jesus,[http://www.studylight.org/com/guz/view.cgi?bookac&chapter\n019 David Guzik's Commentary on the Bible] on  and it is questionable whether Christian baptism was in some way linked with that of John. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism, though whether Jesus intended to institute a continuing, organized church is a matter of dispute among scholars.\n\nThe earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by immersion, complete or partial.\"Lexicographers universally agree that the primary meaning of baptizo G966 is 'to dip' or 'to immerse\", and there is a similar consensus of scholarly opinion that both the baptism of John and of the apostles was by immersion\", Jewett, \"Baptism\", in Murray (ed.), \"Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, volume 1, p.466 (rev. ed. 2009).\"Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT, and it is likely that both of these texts allude to the practice, even though baptism is not the main point of either text.\", Schreiner, \"Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ\", p. 81 (2007).\"Furthermore, modern NT scholars generally concede, regardless of denominational affiliation, that Christian baptism in NT times was by immersion, as it was and still is in Judaism.\", Helyer, 'Exploring Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period\", p. 481 (2002).\"The baptism commanded by Jesus in the making of disciples is an immersion in water. The topic formerly was warmly debated, but in these days there is general scholarly agreement. Several lines of evidence converge in support of the baptismal action as a dipping.\", Ferguson, \"The church of Christ: a biblical ecclesiology for today\", p. 201 (1996).Eerdman's Dictionary of the Bible casts doubt on \"the usual assumption that all NT baptisms were by immersion\" (); and the Global Dictionary of Theology says that it is \"probable\" that immersion was the early church's normal mode of baptism, but that it was not seen as an important issue.()\"Historians have sometimes assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion – or submersion – of the body (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point\" ().\"In the early centuries, baptism was usually by submersion. However, this need not have meant full submersion in the water\" ().Immersion is to be distinguished from submersion (that is going under the water), a minority practice in early Christianity\" (). though other modes may have also been used. \n\nThough some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view the mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.Slade, Darren M. (August 2014). [http://atijournal.org/ATI_Vol7_No2.pdf \"The Early Church's Inconsequential View of the Mode of Baptism.\"] American Theological Inquiry 7 (2): 21–34\n\nBy the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved catechetical instruction as well as chrismation, exorcisms, laying on of hands, and recitation of a creed.\n\nIn the early middle ages infant baptism became common and the rite was significantly simplified. In Western Europe Affusion became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the sixteenth century, Martin Luther retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli considered baptism and the Lord's supper to be symbolic. Anabaptists denied the validity of the practice of infant baptism, and rebaptized converts.\n\nMode and manner\n\nBaptism is practiced in several different ways. Aspersion is the sprinkling of water on the head, and affusion is the pouring of water over the head.\n\nThe word \"immersion\" is derived from late Latin immersio, a noun derived from the verb immergere (in – \"into\" + mergere \"dip\"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use \"immersion\" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?termimmersion Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on August 14, 2010. The term \"immersion\" is also used of a form of baptism in which water is poured over someone standing in water, without submersion of the person. On these three meanings of the word \"immersion\", see Immersion baptism.\n\nWhen \"immersion\" is used in opposition to \"submersion\",In scientific contexts the two words are often understood as mutually exclusive.

Immersion in this sense has been employed in West and East since at least the 2nd century and is the form in which baptism is generally depicted in early Christian art. In the West, this method of baptism began to be replaced by affusion baptism from around the 8th century, but it continues in use in Eastern Christianity.\n\nThe word submersion comes from the late Latin (sub- \"under, below\" + mergere \"plunge, dip\")[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/submerge Submerge – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (April 25, 2007). Retrieved on August 14, 2010. and is also sometimes called \"complete immersion\". It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate's body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches.It is not the only method that these churches use: \"In the present practice of infant baptism in the Greek church the priest holds the child as far under the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to be fully covered with water\" ([https://books.google.com/books?idxC9GAdUGX5sC&pg\nPA894&dqbaptism+priest+%22head%22+%22so+as+to%22&hl\nen&eig4fzTJfpM82FhQedjuylCg&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum1&ved\n0CDEQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nbaptism%20priest%20%22head%22%20%22so%20as%20to%22&f=false Everett Ferguson, Baptism in the Early Church, p. 860]). In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the Ambrosian Rite and is one of the methods provided in the Roman Rite of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the Protestant Reformation, such as Baptists and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\nMeaning of the Greek verb baptizein\n\nThe Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb baptizein, from which the English verb \"baptize\" is derived, as \"dip, plunge\", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: \"baptize\", with which it associates the Septuagint mention of Naaman dipping himself in the Jordan River, and \"perform ablutions\", as in .[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=bapti/zw Liddell & Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: \"βαπτ-ίζω, A. dip, plunge, 'ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν' J.BJ2.18.4; 'σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον' Sor.2.63:—Pass., of a trephine, Gal.10.447; ... 2. draw wine by dipping the cup in the bowl, Aristopho 14.5; 'φιάλαις β. ἐκ . . κρατήρων' ...\" The usage examples quoted here mean \"a sword into his throat\"; \"a sword into the foetus\"; \"draw with cups from bowls\"\n\nAlthough the Greek verb baptizein does not exclusively mean dip, plunge or immerse (it is used with literal and figurative meanings such as \"sink\", \"disable\", \"overwhelm\", \"go under\", \"overborne\", \"draw from a bowl\"),Theological dictionary of the New Testament. 1964–c1976.

In the latter case, however, πλύνω (כבס) and λούομαι (רחץ) are more common, as in Lv. 15:11, 13 etc. The sevenfold dipping of Naaman (2 K. 5:14) perhaps suggests sacramental ideas and illustrates the importance of the Jordan.

Chattanooga, TN: AMG Publishers.\n\n\"While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from , , //, .\"\n\nTwo passages in the Gospels indicate that the verb baptizein did not always indicate submersion. The first is , which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, \"was astonished to see that he did not first wash (ἐβαπτίσθη, aorist passive of βαπτίζω—literally, \"was baptized\") before dinner\". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ' to mean perform ablutions. Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: \"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (') not their hands when they eat bread\" (). The other Gospel passage pointed to is: \"The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash (', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, \"baptize themselves\"—βαπτίσωνται, passive or middle voice of βαπτίζω)\" ().\n\nScholars of various denominations[https://books.google.com/books?idxewBAAAACAAJ A. A. Hodge, Outlines of Theology 1992]   quoted in  claim that these two passages show that invited guests, or people returning from market, would not be expected to immerse themselves (\"baptize themselves\") totally in water but only to practise the partial immersion of dipping their hands in water or to pour water over them, as is the only form admitted by present Jewish custom. In the second of the two passages, it is actually the hands that are specifically identified as \"washed\" (Mark 7:3), not the entire person, for whom the verb used is baptizomai, literally \"be baptized\", \"be immersed\" (Mark 7:4), a fact obscured by English versions that use \"wash\" as a translation of both verbs. Zodhiates concludes that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them.'Washing or ablution was frequently by immersion, indicated by either baptízō or níptō (3538), to wash. In Mark 7:3, the phrase 'wash their hands' is the translation of níptō (3538), to wash part of the body such as the hands. In Mark 7:4 the verb wash in 'except they wash' is baptízomai, to immerse. This indicates that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them in collected water. See Luke 11:38 which refers to washing one's hands before the meal, with the use of baptízomai, to have the hands baptized.\", Zodhiates, S. (2000, c1992, c1993). The Complete Word Study Dictionary : New Testament (electronic ed.) (G907). Chattanooga, TN: AMG Publishers. The Liddell–Scott–Jones Greek-English Lexicon (1996) cites the other passage (Luke 11:38) as an instance of the use of the verb baptizein to mean \"perform ablutions\", not \"submerge\". References to the cleaning of vessels which use βαπτίζω also refer to immersion.'Despite assertions to the contrary, it seems that baptizō, both in Jewish and Christian contexts, normally meant \"immerse\", and that even when it became a technical term for baptism, the thought of immersion remains. The use of the term for cleansing vessels (as in Lev. 6:28 Aquila [cf. 6:21]; cf. baptismos in Mk. 7:4) does not prove the contrary, since vessels were normally cleansed by immersing them in water. The metaphorical uses of the term in the NT appear to take this for granted, e.g. the prophecy that the Messiah will baptise in Spirit and fire as a liquid (Matt. 3:11), the \"baptism\" of the Israelites in the cloud and the sea (1 Cor. 10:2), and in the idea of Jesus' death as a baptism (Mk. 10:38f. baptisma; Lk. 12:50; cf. Ysebaert, op. cit., 41 ff.).', Brown, C. (1986). Vol. 1: New international dictionary of New Testament theology (144)\n\nAs already mentioned, the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that, in the second of these two cases, , the verb baptizein indicates that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water.

She was then purifying herself from her uncleanness.\" Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb baptizein can also relate to the neuter noun baptisma \"baptism\" which is a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.Jonathan David Lawrence Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006), p294 This broadness in the meaning of baptizein is reflected in English Bibles rendering \"wash\", where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees \"except they wash (Greek \"baptize\"), they do not eat\",ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν and \"baptize\" where baptisma, the new Christian rite, is intended.\n\nDerived nouns\n\nTwo nouns derived from the verb baptizo (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun baptismos (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun baptisma (βάπτισμα):\n\n*baptismos (βαπτισμός) refers in  to a water-rite for the purpose of purification, washing, cleansing, of dishes;Arndt, W., Danker, F.

G. Dunn Jesus remembered 2003 p256\n\nA Christian baptism is administered in one of the following forms, performing the action either once or thrice:[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html Didache, chapter 7:] \"Pour out water three times upon the head\".\n\nApparel\n\nUntil the Middle Ages, most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/aroseby.txt\n\nTypical of these is Cyril of Jerusalem who wrote \"On the Mysteries of Baptism\" in the 4th century (c. 350 AD):\n\nThe symbolism is threefold:\n\n1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—\"by water and the Spirit\"—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism \"λοχείαν\", i.e., giving birth, and \"new way of creation...from water and Spirit\" (\"to John\" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:\n\n2. The removal of clothing represented the \"image of putting off the old man with his deeds\" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the \"new man\", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.\n\n3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the \"old man\" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.\n\nChanging customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) and/or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.\n\nMeaning and effects\n\nThere are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a sacrament, and speak of \"baptismal regeneration\". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the \"Mystical Body of Christ\" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations, and by Churches formed early during the Protestant Reformation such as Lutheran and Anglican. For example, Martin Luther said:\n\nThe Churches of Christ,\" Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and LDS Church also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.\n\nFor Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood (martyrdom). In his encyclical Mystici corporis Christi of June 29, 1943, Pope Pius XII spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:\n\nBy contrast, Anabaptist and Evangelical Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. Reformed and Methodist Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism. \n\nChurches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God \"by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.\" Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it \"is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God\".\n\nChristian traditions\n\nThe liturgy of baptism for Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of Noah and the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea divided by Moses. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe that baptism is necessary for the cleansing of the taint of original sin, and for that reason infant baptism is a common practice. The Eastern Churches (Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as , which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by Chrismation and Communion at the next Divine Liturgy, regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam. Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.\n\nEastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. Latin Church Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion. Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.\n\nAccording to evidence which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200, sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.\n\nBaptists argue that the Greek word  originally meant \"to immerse\". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being \"buried\" and \"raised\" with Christ. Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.\n\nSome \"Full Gospel\" charismatic churches such as Oneness Pentecostals baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority. \n\nEcumenical statements\n\nIn 1982 the World Council of Churches published the ecumenical paper Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry. The preface of the document states:\n\nA 1997 document, Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism, gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:\n\nThose who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh. Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, 1 Peter testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life lead to purification and new birth. This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking God's food, by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God—and by further moral formation. At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit. So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit. In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with Nicodemus indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules. \n\nValidity considerations by some churches\n\nSince the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches teach that baptism is a sacrament that has actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.\n\nOne of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb \"baptize\" is essential. Catholics of the Latin Church, Anglicans and Methodists use the form \"I baptize you....\" Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholics use a passive voice form \"The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of....\" or \"This person is baptized by my hands....\"\n\nUse of the Trinitarian formula \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-Trinitarian churches such as Oneness Pentecostals. \n\nAnother essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.\n\nAnother requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention \"to do what the Church does\", not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.\n\nSome conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, \"it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void.\" For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an indelible \"seal\" upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the Donatists who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ex opere operato and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.\n\nRecognition by other denominations\n\nThe Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, \"Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity.\" In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, conditional baptism is administered, with a formula on the lines of \"If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you....\"[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057–1059.\n\nIn the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestants. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of Eastern Christianity, but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the LDS Church.\n\nPractice in the Eastern Orthodox Church for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by chrismation or, in rare circumstances, confession of faith alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local canons and is the subject of some controversy.\n\nOriental Orthodox Churches recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.\n\nIn the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the LDS Church is invalid.[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html Declaration] of June 5, 2001 by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: \"The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it.\"\n\nThe LDS Church stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as valid.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses do not recognise any other baptism occurring after 1914\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, May 1, 1959, p. 288, \"Thus, when Christ was enthroned as King A.D. 1914 it was not necessary for all true Christians to be rebaptized in recognition of his ruling position.\" as valid,\"Jehovah's Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship\", The Watchtower, September 15, 1966, p. 560, \"In the decades of restoration since 1919, right-hearted clergymen of various religious sects in different parts of the earth have repentantly accepted the priesthood services of the anointed remnant of Job-like ones by becoming rebaptized and ordained as true ministers of Jehovah.\" as they believe that they are now the one true church of Christ,\"True Christianity Is Flourishing\", The Watchtower, March 1, 2004, p. 7 [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004161 As retrieved November 3, 2014], \"While Christendom's theologians, missionaries, and churchgoers continue to grapple with the gathering storm of controversy in their churches, true Christianity is flourishing worldwide. Indeed, true Christians...invite you to join Jehovah's Witnesses in united Christian worship of the only true God, Jehovah.\" and that the rest of \"Christendom\" is false religion.Jehovah's Witnesses— Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, publ Jehovah's Witnesses, \"Chapter 31: How Chosen and Led by God\", p. 706, \"Clearly, when the time of the end began in 1914, none of the churches of Christendom were measuring up to these Bible standards for the one true Christian congregation. What, though, about the Bible Students, as Jehovah's Witnesses were then known?\"\n\nOfficiator\n\nThere is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. The examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except in extremis, i.e., when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, canon law for the Latin Church lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon, but its administration is one of the functions \"especially entrusted to the parish priest\". If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself. If no ordinary minister is available, a catechist or some other person whom the local ordinary has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity any person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism  By \"a case of necessity\" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. \"The requisite intention\" is, at the minimum level, the intention \"to do what the Church does\" through the rite of baptism.\n\nIn the Eastern Catholic Churches, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local hierarch grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, \"in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize.\"\n\nThe discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church. The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism in extremis may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the Mystery of Chrismation.\n\nThe discipline of Anglicanism and Lutheranism is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For Methodists and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.\n\nNewer movements of Protestant Evangelical churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.\n\nIn the LDS Church, only a man who has been ordained to the Aaronic priesthood holding the priesthood office of priest or higher office in the Melchizedek priesthood may administer baptism.\n\nA Jehovah's Witnesses baptism is performed by a \"dedicated male\" adherent.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1973, page 480, \"In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present.\"\"The General Priesthood Today\", The Watchtower, March 1, 1963, page 147, \"Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord's death.\" Only in extraordinary circumstances would a \"dedicated\" baptizer be unbaptized (see section Jehovah's Witnesses).\n\nSpecific Christian groups practicing baptism\n\nAnabaptist\n\nAnabaptists (\"re-baptizers\") and Baptists promote adult baptism, or \"believer's baptism\". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as savior.\n\nEarly Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.\n\nThe traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring or sprinkling, the form commonly used in the West in the early 16th century when they emerged. Since the 18th century immersion and submersion became more widespread. Today all forms of baptism can be found among Anabaptist.[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Baptism#Mode_and_Ritual Baptism - Mode and Ritual] at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online.\n\nBaptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ's cross.London Baptist Confession of 1644, XVII. Web: [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm London Baptist Confession of 1644. Dec 29, 2009]  It is considered a covenantal act, signifying entrance into the New Covenant of Christ.; ; \n\nBaptist\n\nFor the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.\"The Baptist Faith and Message,\" Southern Baptist Convention. Adopted, June 14, 2000. Accessed July 29, 2009: http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#vii\n\nFurthermore, for a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted \"new members classes\" as a mandatory step for congregational membership).\n\nRegarding rebaptism the general rules are:\n*baptisms by other than immersion are not recognized as valid and therefore rebaptism by immersion is required; and \n*baptisms by immersion in other denominations may be considered valid if performed after the person having professed faith in Jesus Christ (though among the more conservative groups such as Independent Baptists, rebaptism may be required by the local congregation if performed in a non-Baptist church – and, in extreme cases, even if performed within a Baptist church that wasn't an Independent Baptist congregation)\n\nChurches of Christ\n\nBaptism in Churches of Christ is performed only by full bodily immersion, based on the Koine Greek verb baptizo which means to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge., and here [http://church-of-christ.org/who.html], here  and here  Submersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism. Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the 1st century, and that pouring and sprinkling later emerged as secondary modes when immersion was not possible. Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion. Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (i.e., infant baptism is not practiced because the New Testament has no precedent for it).\n\nChurches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion. The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. David Lipscomb insisted that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. Austin McGary contended that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared.  As such, the general practice among churches of Christ is to require rebaptism by immersion of converts, even those who were previously baptized by immersion in other churches.\n\nMore recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ (who \"saw themselves as the only true Christians and insisted on reimmersing all who come into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ\") has caused some to reexamine the issue.\n\nChurches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God \"by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.\" Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it \"is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God.\" While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a \"sacrament\", their view of it can legitimately be described as \"sacramental.\" They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as \"the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation.\" There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to \"reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity.\"\n\nBecause of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration.Douglas A. Foster, [http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/2000s/vol_43_no_2_contents/foster.html \"Churches of Christ and Baptism: An Historical and Theological Overview,\"]  Restoration Quarterly, Volume 43/Number 2 (2001) However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. Rather, their inclination is to point to the biblical passage in which Peter, analogizing baptism to Noah's flood, posits that \"likewise baptism doth also now save us\" but parenthetically clarifies that baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the response of a good conscience toward God\" (1 Peter 3:21).KJV, italics inserted. One author from the churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, \"Faith is the reason why a person is a child of God; baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God\" (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a \"work\" that earns salvation.\n\nReformed Protestantism\n\nIn Reformed baptismal theology, baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of union with Christ and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized. Reformed theologians believe the Holy Spirit brings into effect the promises signified in baptism. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. Baptism also initiates one into the visible church and the covenant of grace. Baptism is seen as a replacement of circumcision, which is considered the rite of initiation into the covenant of grace in the Old Testament.\n\nReformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, with no allowance for emergency baptism, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church, accept the validity of baptisms performed with them and do not rebaptize.\n\nRoman Catholicism\n\nIn Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be \"necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire\". This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the Gospel according to John: \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\" It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until Huldrych Zwingli denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.\"  The Council of Trent also states in the Decree Concerning Justification from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation.  A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, \"those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience.\"\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: \"Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate\". In the Roman Rite of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: \"Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord.\"Rite of Baptism of Children, 86\n\nIn the Catholic Church by baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins. Given once for all, baptism cannot be repeated. Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte \"a new creature,\" an adopted son of God, who has become a \"partaker of the divine nature,\" member of Christ and co-heir with him, and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Sanctifying grace, the grace of justification, given by God by baptism, erases the original sin and personal actual sins.Catechism of the Catholic Church: THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM  \n\nCatholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy SpiritOrdo initiationis christanae adultorum, editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV De Fide Catholica, DS 802, cf Florence, Decretum pro Armeniis, DS, 1317.—not three gods, but one God subsisting in three Persons. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three \"masks\" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three \"Persons\" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.\n\nIt is claimed that Pope Stephen I, St. Ambrose and Pope Nicholas I declared that baptisms in the name of \"Jesus\" only as well as in the name of \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed. Current canonical law requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.\n\nThe Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: \"baptism of blood\" and \"baptism of desire\". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are martyred for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to catechumens who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:\n\nThe Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)\n\nFor catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)\n\nThe Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: \"'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.\" As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; \"the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God\".\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.Jet magazine, August 4, 1955, page 26 [https://books.google.com/books?idxbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg\nPA26&dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]\n\nProspective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation elders to assess their suitability.Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182. Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.\n\nMost baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servantsThe Watchtower, May 15, 1970, page 309.\"The General Priesthood Today\", The Watchtower, March 1, 1963, page 147Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, \"Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses.\" and rarely occur at local Kingdom Halls.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1973, page 480 Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:Watchtower June 1, 1985\n\nOnly baptized males may baptize new members.

It is followed by confirmation, which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a baptism with the Holy Spirit. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated. It typically occurs in a baptismal font.\n\nIn addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a priest or elder). Authority is passed down through a form of apostolic succession. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or re-baptized. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their \"natural\" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.\n\nAccording to Latter-day Saint theology, faith and repentance are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of original sin, as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects infant baptismBook of Mormon,  and baptism must occur after the age of accountability, defined in Latter-day Saint scripture as eight years old.\n\nLatter-day Saint theology also teaches baptism for the dead in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in . This occurs in Latter-day Saint temples.\n\nNon-practitioners\n\nQuakers\n\nQuakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward sacraments in their religious life. Robert Barclay's Apology for the True Christian Divinity (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:\n\nBarclay argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which Quakers argue is meaningless.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe Salvation Army does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward sacraments. William Booth and Catherine Booth, the founders of the Salvation Army, believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the Salvation Army does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.\n\nHyperdispensationalism\n\nThere are some Christians termed \"Hyperdispensationalists\" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism)who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles.\"Prison epistles\" include Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's. Hyperdispensationalists assert:\n\n*The great commission[] and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.\n*The baptism of  is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of atonement for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.\n\nWater baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism foretold by John the Baptist., ,  Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.\n\nMany in this group also argue that John's promised baptism by fire is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire., , \n\nJohn, as he said \"baptized with water\", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples. Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize in contradiction to the Great Commission.cf. But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth and in Philippi,. He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection. Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.\n\nOther Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission  and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation  or the baptism of the Holy Spirit until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul. Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.\n\nComparative summary\n\nComparative Summary of Baptisms of Denominations of Christian Influence.Good News. Issue 3. St Louis, MO. 2003. pp 18–19 (This section does not give a complete listing of denominations, and therefore, it only mentions a fraction of the churches practicing \"believer's baptism\".)\n\nDebaptism\n\nMost Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be neither repeated nor undone. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by rejecting religion entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.\n\nOther initiation ceremonies\n\nMany cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the ancient Egyptian, the Hebraic/Jewish, the Babylonian, the Mayan, and the Norse cultures. The modern Japanese practice of Miyamairi is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be archaeological and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.\n\nMystery religion initiation rites\n\nApuleius, a 2nd-century Roman writer, described an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting. Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of Osiris and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Penguin Books), pp. 211–214\n\nThe water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to catechumenal practices preceding baptism in Christianity.\n\nGnostic Catholicism and Thelema\n\nThe Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of Ordo Templi Orientis), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11 years old. The ceremony is performed before a Gnostic Mass and represents a symbolic birth into the Thelemic community.\n\nBaptism of objects\n\nThe word \"baptism\" or \"christening\" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.\n*The name Baptism of Bells has been given to the blessing of (musical, especially church) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with holy water by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming censer is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.\n*Baptism of Ships: at least since the time of the Crusades, rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The ship is usually sprinkled with holy water.\n*\"Baptism of Dolls\": the custom of 'dolly dunking' was once a common practice in parts of the United Kingdom, particularly in Cornwall where it has been revived in recent years http://www.cornishman.co.uk/pictures/PICTURES-Good-Friday-dolly-dunking-Fenton/pictures-26301254-detail/pictures.html\n\nMandaean baptism\n\nMandaeans revere John the Baptist and practice frequent baptism as a ritual of purification, not of initiation.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; see below) is a Christian sacrament of admission and adoption,St. Paul: Romans 8:15 \"the spirit of adoption\" (\"of sonship\" RSV), Galatians 4:5 \"adoption of sons\", Ephesians 1:15 \"the adoption of children by Jesus Christ\" (\"to be his sons through Jesus Christ\" RSV). almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally.For example, \"baptized in the Catholic Church\" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Second Vatican Council, Lumen gentium, 28]  The canonical Gospels report that Jesus was baptized, , —a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Baptism has been called a holy sacrament and an ordinance of Jesus Christ. In some denominations, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word \"christening\" is reserved for the baptism of infants. Baptism has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.\n\nThe usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the candidate to be immersed, either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). While John the Baptist's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, \"The fact that he chose a permanent and deep river suggests that more than a token quantity of water was needed, and both the preposition 'in' (the Jordan) and the basic meaning of the verb 'baptize' probably indicate immersion. In v. 16, Matthew will speak of Jesus 'coming up out of the water'.  Phillip and the Eunuch also went down and came up out of water (Acts 8:38-39).  Baptism is likened unto a burial in Romans 6:3. \"Dip\" is translated from baptō ().  The traditional depiction in Christian art of John the Baptist pouring water over Jesus' head may therefore be based on later Christian practice.\" Pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body.  Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead, a method called affusion.\n\nMartyrdom was identified early in Church history as \"baptism by blood\", enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire, by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of infant baptism, baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense necessary for salvation, until Huldrych Zwingli in the 16th century denied its necessity.\n\nQuakers and The Salvation Army practice Baptism with the Holy Spirit instead of baptism with water. Among denominations that practice baptism by water, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" (following the Great Commission), but some baptize in Jesus' name only. Much more than half of all Christians baptize infants; many others hold that only believer's baptism is true baptism. Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient. The term \"baptism\" has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word baptism is derived indirectly through Latin from the neuter Greek concept noun baptisma (Greek , \"washing-ism\"),, , , . The several Greek words from which the English word baptism has been formed are used by Greek writers (in classical antiquity, in the Septuagint, and in the New Testament) with a great latitude of meaning, including \"to make Christian\" and \"baptisma pyros (baptism of fire)\" — [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P1992.html The University of Texas at Austin, College of Liberal Arts, Linguistics Research Center, Indo-European Lexicon, PIE (Proto-Indo-European) Etymon and IE (Indo-European) Reflexes: \"baptism\"] [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0414.html and \"baptize\"], [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0703.html Greek baptein, baptizein, baptos] — [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm#II New Advent, Catholic Encyclopedia: \"Baptism\": Etymology] — [http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Theological_Terms/A_Prior_%20to_Born_Again.htm Spirit Restoration, Theological Terms: A to B Dictionary: \"baptize\"] (scroll down to \"baptism\") — [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term\nbaptize Online Etymological Dictionary: \"baptize\"] — [http://bibleencyclopedia.com/baptism.htm International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: \"baptism\"] — two parallel online sources, Search God's Word and Eliyah, for \"Strong's numbers\":  [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number907 Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible:  Greek Lexicon 907 βαπτίζω \"baptize\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file\ngreeklexicon&isindex907 907 baptizo \"baptize\"], [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number\n908 908 βάπτισμα \"baptism\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?filegreeklexicon&isindex\n908 908 baptisma \"baptism\"], [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number909 909 βαπτισμός \"baptisms\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file\ngreeklexicon&isindex909 909 baptismos \"baptisms\"], and [http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number\n910  910 βαπτστἠς \"baptist\"]/[http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?filegreeklexicon&isindex\n910  910 baptistes \"baptist\"].  which is a neologism in the New Testament derived from the masculine Greek noun baptismos (), a term for ritual washing in Greek language texts of Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period, such as the Septuagint. Both of these nouns are derived from the verb baptizō (, \"I wash\" transitive verb), which is used in Jewish texts for ritual washing, and in the New Testament both for ritual washing and also for the apparently new rite of baptisma. The Greek verb baptō (), \"dip\", from which the verb baptizo is derived, is in turn hypothetically traced to a reconstructed Indo-European root *gʷabh-, \"dip\".American Heritage Dictionary of the English language, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4IHbQgz1nZYC&lpg=PA33 page 33].  The Greek words are used in a great variety of meanings.\n\nHistory\n\nBaptism has similarities to Tvilah, a Jewish purification ritual of immersing in water, which is required for, among other things, conversion to Judaism, but which differs in being repeatable, while baptism is to be performed only once. (In fact, the Modern Hebrew term for \"baptism\" is \"Christian Tvilah\".) John the Baptist, who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement.sacrament (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 20, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515366/sacrament The apostle Paul distinguished between the baptism of John, (\"baptism of repentance\") and baptism in the name of Jesus,[http://www.studylight.org/com/guz/view.cgi?bookac&chapter\n019 David Guzik's Commentary on the Bible] on  and it is questionable whether Christian baptism was in some way linked with that of John. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism, though whether Jesus intended to institute a continuing, organized church is a matter of dispute among scholars.\n\nThe earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by immersion, complete or partial.\"Lexicographers universally agree that the primary meaning of baptizo G966 is 'to dip' or 'to immerse\", and there is a similar consensus of scholarly opinion that both the baptism of John and of the apostles was by immersion\", Jewett, \"Baptism\", in Murray (ed.), \"Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, volume 1, p.466 (rev. ed. 2009).\"Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT, and it is likely that both of these texts allude to the practice, even though baptism is not the main point of either text.\", Schreiner, \"Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ\", p. 81 (2007).\"Furthermore, modern NT scholars generally concede, regardless of denominational affiliation, that Christian baptism in NT times was by immersion, as it was and still is in Judaism.\", Helyer, 'Exploring Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period\", p. 481 (2002).\"The baptism commanded by Jesus in the making of disciples is an immersion in water. The topic formerly was warmly debated, but in these days there is general scholarly agreement. Several lines of evidence converge in support of the baptismal action as a dipping.\", Ferguson, \"The church of Christ: a biblical ecclesiology for today\", p. 201 (1996).Eerdman's Dictionary of the Bible casts doubt on \"the usual assumption that all NT baptisms were by immersion\" (); and the Global Dictionary of Theology says that it is \"probable\" that immersion was the early church's normal mode of baptism, but that it was not seen as an important issue.()\"Historians have sometimes assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion – or submersion – of the body (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point\" ().\"In the early centuries, baptism was usually by submersion. However, this need not have meant full submersion in the water\" ().Immersion is to be distinguished from submersion (that is going under the water), a minority practice in early Christianity\" (). though other modes may have also been used. \n\nThough some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view the mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.Slade, Darren M. (August 2014). [http://atijournal.org/ATI_Vol7_No2.pdf \"The Early Church's Inconsequential View of the Mode of Baptism.\"] American Theological Inquiry 7 (2): 21–34\n\nBy the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved catechetical instruction as well as chrismation, exorcisms, laying on of hands, and recitation of a creed.\n\nIn the early middle ages infant baptism became common and the rite was significantly simplified. In Western Europe Affusion became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the sixteenth century, Martin Luther retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli considered baptism and the Lord's supper to be symbolic. Anabaptists denied the validity of the practice of infant baptism, and rebaptized converts.\n\nMode and manner\n\nBaptism is practiced in several different ways. Aspersion is the sprinkling of water on the head, and affusion is the pouring of water over the head.\n\nThe word \"immersion\" is derived from late Latin immersio, a noun derived from the verb immergere (in – \"into\" + mergere \"dip\"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use \"immersion\" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?termimmersion Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on August 14, 2010. The term \"immersion\" is also used of a form of baptism in which water is poured over someone standing in water, without submersion of the person.

Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches.It is not the only method that these churches use: \"In the present practice of infant baptism in the Greek church the priest holds the child as far under the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to be fully covered with water\" ([https://books.google.com/books?idxC9GAdUGX5sC&pg\nPA894&dqbaptism+priest+%22head%22+%22so+as+to%22&hl\nen&eig4fzTJfpM82FhQedjuylCg&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum1&ved\n0CDEQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nbaptism%20priest%20%22head%22%20%22so%20as%20to%22&f=false Everett Ferguson, Baptism in the Early Church, p. 860]). In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the Ambrosian Rite and is one of the methods provided in the Roman Rite of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the Protestant Reformation, such as Baptists and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\nMeaning of the Greek verb baptizein\n\nThe Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb baptizein, from which the English verb \"baptize\" is derived, as \"dip, plunge\", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: \"baptize\", with which it associates the Septuagint mention of Naaman dipping himself in the Jordan River, and \"perform ablutions\", as in .[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=bapti/zw Liddell & Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: \"βαπτ-ίζω, A. dip, plunge, 'ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν' J.BJ2.18.4; 'σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον' Sor.2.63:—Pass., of a trephine, Gal.10.447; ... 2. draw wine by dipping the cup in the bowl, Aristopho 14.5; 'φιάλαις β. ἐκ . . κρατήρων' ...\" The usage examples quoted here mean \"a sword into his throat\"; \"a sword into the foetus\"; \"draw with cups from bowls\"\n\nAlthough the Greek verb baptizein does not exclusively mean dip, plunge or immerse (it is used with literal and figurative meanings such as \"sink\", \"disable\", \"overwhelm\", \"go under\", \"overborne\", \"draw from a bowl\"),Theological dictionary of the New Testament. 1964–c1976.

The first is , which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, \"was astonished to see that he did not first wash (ἐβαπτίσθη, aorist passive of βαπτίζω—literally, \"was baptized\") before dinner\". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ' to mean perform ablutions. Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: \"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (') not their hands when they eat bread\" (). The other Gospel passage pointed to is: \"The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash (', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, \"baptize themselves\"—βαπτίσωνται, passive or middle voice of βαπτίζω)\" ().\n\nScholars of various denominations[https://books.google.com/books?idxewBAAAACAAJ A. A. Hodge, Outlines of Theology 1992]   quoted in  claim that these two passages show that invited guests, or people returning from market, would not be expected to immerse themselves (\"baptize themselves\") totally in water but only to practise the partial immersion of dipping their hands in water or to pour water over them, as is the only form admitted by present Jewish custom. In the second of the two passages, it is actually the hands that are specifically identified as \"washed\" (Mark 7:3), not the entire person, for whom the verb used is baptizomai, literally \"be baptized\", \"be immersed\" (Mark 7:4), a fact obscured by English versions that use \"wash\" as a translation of both verbs. Zodhiates concludes that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them.'Washing or ablution was frequently by immersion, indicated by either baptízō or níptō (3538), to wash. In Mark 7:3, the phrase 'wash their hands' is the translation of níptō (3538), to wash part of the body such as the hands. In Mark 7:4 the verb wash in 'except they wash' is baptízomai, to immerse. This indicates that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them in collected water. See Luke 11:38 which refers to washing one's hands before the meal, with the use of baptízomai, to have the hands baptized.\", Zodhiates, S. (2000, c1992, c1993). The Complete Word Study Dictionary : New Testament (electronic ed.) (G907). Chattanooga, TN: AMG Publishers. The Liddell–Scott–Jones Greek-English Lexicon (1996) cites the other passage (Luke 11:38) as an instance of the use of the verb baptizein to mean \"perform ablutions\", not \"submerge\". References to the cleaning of vessels which use βαπτίζω also refer to immersion.'Despite assertions to the contrary, it seems that baptizō, both in Jewish and Christian contexts, normally meant \"immerse\", and that even when it became a technical term for baptism, the thought of immersion remains. The use of the term for cleansing vessels (as in Lev. 6:28 Aquila [cf. 6:21]; cf. baptismos in Mk. 7:4) does not prove the contrary, since vessels were normally cleansed by immersing them in water. The metaphorical uses of the term in the NT appear to take this for granted, e.g. the prophecy that the Messiah will baptise in Spirit and fire as a liquid (Matt. 3:11), the \"baptism\" of the Israelites in the cloud and the sea (1 Cor. 10:2), and in the idea of Jesus' death as a baptism (Mk. 10:38f. baptisma; Lk. 12:50; cf. Ysebaert, op. cit., 41 ff.).', Brown, C. (1986). Vol. 1: New international dictionary of New Testament theology (144)\n\nAs already mentioned, the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that, in the second of these two cases, , the verb baptizein indicates that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water.

Leithart The Baptized Body 2007 p136 \"Paul uses a distancing third person—\"they\" baptize for the dead. Why not \"we\"? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices. Under the ceremonial laws of Torah, every washing was a washing \"for the dead\" (cf. Num. 19). Uncleanness was a ceremonial form of death, and through washings of various sorts the unclean dead were restored to life in fellowship with..\" In Jewish Greek the verb baptizein \"baptized\" has a wider reference than just \"baptism\" and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun baptismos \"ritual washing\" The verb baptizein occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, baptismos; Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, Naaman washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.Philippe Wolff Baptism: The Covenant and the Family 2009 p45 \"This word occurs but four times in the Septuagint, and in no case with the Baptist meaning. 1st. \"Judith baptized herself in a fountain of water, by the camp.\" (Judith xii. 7.) She was then purifying herself from her uncleanness.\" Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb baptizein can also relate to the neuter noun baptisma \"baptism\" which is a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.Jonathan David Lawrence Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006), p294 This broadness in the meaning of baptizein is reflected in English Bibles rendering \"wash\", where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees \"except they wash (Greek \"baptize\"), they do not eat\",ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν and \"baptize\" where baptisma, the new Christian rite, is intended.\n\nDerived nouns\n\nTwo nouns derived from the verb baptizo (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun baptismos (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun baptisma (βάπτισμα):\n\n*baptismos (βαπτισμός) refers in  to a water-rite for the purpose of purification, washing, cleansing, of dishes;Arndt, W., Danker, F.

G. Dunn Jesus remembered 2003 p256\n\nA Christian baptism is administered in one of the following forms, performing the action either once or thrice:[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html Didache, chapter 7:] \"Pour out water three times upon the head\".\n\nApparel\n\nUntil the Middle Ages, most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/aroseby.txt\n\nTypical of these is Cyril of Jerusalem who wrote \"On the Mysteries of Baptism\" in the 4th century (c. 350 AD):\n\nThe symbolism is threefold:\n\n1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—\"by water and the Spirit\"—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism \"λοχείαν\", i.e., giving birth, and \"new way of creation...from water and Spirit\" (\"to John\" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:\n\n2. The removal of clothing represented the \"image of putting off the old man with his deeds\" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the \"new man\", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.\n\n3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the \"old man\" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.\n\nChanging customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) and/or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.\n\nMeaning and effects\n\nThere are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a sacrament, and speak of \"baptismal regeneration\". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the \"Mystical Body of Christ\" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations, and by Churches formed early during the Protestant Reformation such as Lutheran and Anglican. For example, Martin Luther said:\n\nThe Churches of Christ,\" Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and LDS Church also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.\n\nFor Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood (martyrdom). In his encyclical Mystici corporis Christi of June 29, 1943, Pope Pius XII spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:\n\nBy contrast, Anabaptist and Evangelical Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. Reformed and Methodist Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism. \n\nChurches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God \"by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.\" Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it \"is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God\".\n\nChristian traditions\n\nThe liturgy of baptism for Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of Noah and the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea divided by Moses. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe that baptism is necessary for the cleansing of the taint of original sin, and for that reason infant baptism is a common practice. The Eastern Churches (Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as , which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by Chrismation and Communion at the next Divine Liturgy, regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam. Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.\n\nEastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. Latin Church Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion. Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.\n\nAccording to evidence which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200, sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.\n\nBaptists argue that the Greek word  originally meant \"to immerse\". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being \"buried\" and \"raised\" with Christ. Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.\n\nSome \"Full Gospel\" charismatic churches such as Oneness Pentecostals baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority. \n\nEcumenical statements\n\nIn 1982 the World Council of Churches published the ecumenical paper Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry. The preface of the document states:\n\nA 1997 document, Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism, gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:\n\nThose who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh. Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, 1 Peter testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life lead to purification and new birth. This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking God's food, by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God—and by further moral formation. At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit. So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit. In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with Nicodemus indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules. \n\nValidity considerations by some churches\n\nSince the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches teach that baptism is a sacrament that has actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.\n\nOne of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb \"baptize\" is essential. Catholics of the Latin Church, Anglicans and Methodists use the form \"I baptize you....\" Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholics use a passive voice form \"The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of....\" or \"This person is baptized by my hands....\"\n\nUse of the Trinitarian formula \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-Trinitarian churches such as Oneness Pentecostals. \n\nAnother essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.\n\nAnother requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention \"to do what the Church does\", not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.\n\nSome conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, \"it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void.\" For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an indelible \"seal\" upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the Donatists who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ex opere operato and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.\n\nRecognition by other denominations\n\nThe Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, \"Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity.\" In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, conditional baptism is administered, with a formula on the lines of \"If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you....\"[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057–1059.\n\nIn the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestants. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of Eastern Christianity, but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the LDS Church.\n\nPractice in the Eastern Orthodox Church for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by chrismation or, in rare circumstances, confession of faith alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local canons and is the subject of some controversy.\n\nOriental Orthodox Churches recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.\n\nIn the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the LDS Church is invalid.[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html Declaration] of June 5, 2001 by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: \"The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it.\"\n\nThe LDS Church stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as valid.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses do not recognise any other baptism occurring after 1914\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, May 1, 1959, p. 288, \"Thus, when Christ was enthroned as King A.D. 1914 it was not necessary for all true Christians to be rebaptized in recognition of his ruling position.\" as valid,\"Jehovah's Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship\", The Watchtower, September 15, 1966, p. 560, \"In the decades of restoration since 1919, right-hearted clergymen of various religious sects in different parts of the earth have repentantly accepted the priesthood services of the anointed remnant of Job-like ones by becoming rebaptized and ordained as true ministers of Jehovah.\" as they believe that they are now the one true church of Christ,\"True Christianity Is Flourishing\", The Watchtower, March 1, 2004, p. 7 [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004161 As retrieved November 3, 2014], \"While Christendom's theologians, missionaries, and churchgoers continue to grapple with the gathering storm of controversy in their churches, true Christianity is flourishing worldwide. Indeed, true Christians...invite you to join Jehovah's Witnesses in united Christian worship of the only true God, Jehovah.\" and that the rest of \"Christendom\" is false religion.Jehovah's Witnesses— Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, publ Jehovah's Witnesses, \"Chapter 31: How Chosen and Led by God\", p. 706, \"Clearly, when the time of the end began in 1914, none of the churches of Christendom were measuring up to these Bible standards for the one true Christian congregation. What, though, about the Bible Students, as Jehovah's Witnesses were then known?\"\n\nOfficiator\n\nThere is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. The examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except in extremis, i.e., when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, canon law for the Latin Church lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon, but its administration is one of the functions \"especially entrusted to the parish priest\". If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself. If no ordinary minister is available, a catechist or some other person whom the local ordinary has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity any person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism  By \"a case of necessity\" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. \"The requisite intention\" is, at the minimum level, the intention \"to do what the Church does\" through the rite of baptism.\n\nIn the Eastern Catholic Churches, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local hierarch grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, \"in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize.\"\n\nThe discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church. The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism in extremis may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the Mystery of Chrismation.\n\nThe discipline of Anglicanism and Lutheranism is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For Methodists and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.\n\nNewer movements of Protestant Evangelical churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.\n\nIn the LDS Church, only a man who has been ordained to the Aaronic priesthood holding the priesthood office of priest or higher office in the Melchizedek priesthood may administer baptism.\n\nA Jehovah's Witnesses baptism is performed by a \"dedicated male\" adherent.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1973, page 480, \"In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present.\"\"The General Priesthood Today\", The Watchtower, March 1, 1963, page 147, \"Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord's death.\" Only in extraordinary circumstances would a \"dedicated\" baptizer be unbaptized (see section Jehovah's Witnesses).\n\nSpecific Christian groups practicing baptism\n\nAnabaptist\n\nAnabaptists (\"re-baptizers\") and Baptists promote adult baptism, or \"believer's baptism\". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as savior.\n\nEarly Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.\n\nThe traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring or sprinkling, the form commonly used in the West in the early 16th century when they emerged. Since the 18th century immersion and submersion became more widespread. Today all forms of baptism can be found among Anabaptist.[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Baptism#Mode_and_Ritual Baptism - Mode and Ritual] at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online.\n\nBaptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ's cross.London Baptist Confession of 1644, XVII. Web: [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm London Baptist Confession of 1644. Dec 29, 2009]  It is considered a covenantal act, signifying entrance into the New Covenant of Christ.; ; \n\nBaptist\n\nFor the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.\"The Baptist Faith and Message,\" Southern Baptist Convention. Adopted, June 14, 2000. Accessed July 29, 2009: http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#vii\n\nFurthermore, for a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted \"new members classes\" as a mandatory step for congregational membership).\n\nRegarding rebaptism the general rules are:\n*baptisms by other than immersion are not recognized as valid and therefore rebaptism by immersion is required; and \n*baptisms by immersion in other denominations may be considered valid if performed after the person having professed faith in Jesus Christ (though among the more conservative groups such as Independent Baptists, rebaptism may be required by the local congregation if performed in a non-Baptist church – and, in extreme cases, even if performed within a Baptist church that wasn't an Independent Baptist congregation)\n\nChurches of Christ\n\nBaptism in Churches of Christ is performed only by full bodily immersion, based on the Koine Greek verb baptizo which means to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge., and here [http://church-of-christ.org/who.html], here  and here  Submersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism. Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the 1st century, and that pouring and sprinkling later emerged as secondary modes when immersion was not possible. Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion. Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (i.e., infant baptism is not practiced because the New Testament has no precedent for it).\n\nChurches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion. The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. David Lipscomb insisted that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. Austin McGary contended that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared.  As such, the general practice among churches of Christ is to require rebaptism by immersion of converts, even those who were previously baptized by immersion in other churches.\n\nMore recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ (who \"saw themselves as the only true Christians and insisted on reimmersing all who come into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ\") has caused some to reexamine the issue.\n\nChurches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God \"by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.\" Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it \"is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God.\" While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a \"sacrament\", their view of it can legitimately be described as \"sacramental.\" They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as \"the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation.\" There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to \"reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity.\"\n\nBecause of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration.Douglas A. Foster, [http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/2000s/vol_43_no_2_contents/foster.html \"Churches of Christ and Baptism: An Historical and Theological Overview,\"]  Restoration Quarterly, Volume 43/Number 2 (2001) However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. Rather, their inclination is to point to the biblical passage in which Peter, analogizing baptism to Noah's flood, posits that \"likewise baptism doth also now save us\" but parenthetically clarifies that baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the response of a good conscience toward God\" (1 Peter 3:21).KJV, italics inserted. One author from the churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, \"Faith is the reason why a person is a child of God; baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God\" (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a \"work\" that earns salvation.\n\nReformed Protestantism\n\nIn Reformed baptismal theology, baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of union with Christ and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized. Reformed theologians believe the Holy Spirit brings into effect the promises signified in baptism. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. Baptism also initiates one into the visible church and the covenant of grace. Baptism is seen as a replacement of circumcision, which is considered the rite of initiation into the covenant of grace in the Old Testament.\n\nReformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, with no allowance for emergency baptism, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church, accept the validity of baptisms performed with them and do not rebaptize.\n\nRoman Catholicism\n\nIn Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be \"necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire\". This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the Gospel according to John: \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\" It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until Huldrych Zwingli denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.\"  The Council of Trent also states in the Decree Concerning Justification from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation.  A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, \"those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience.\"\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: \"Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate\". In the Roman Rite of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: \"Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord.\"Rite of Baptism of Children, 86\n\nIn the Catholic Church by baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins. Given once for all, baptism cannot be repeated. Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte \"a new creature,\" an adopted son of God, who has become a \"partaker of the divine nature,\" member of Christ and co-heir with him, and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Sanctifying grace, the grace of justification, given by God by baptism, erases the original sin and personal actual sins.Catechism of the Catholic Church: THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM  \n\nCatholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy SpiritOrdo initiationis christanae adultorum, editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV De Fide Catholica, DS 802, cf Florence, Decretum pro Armeniis, DS, 1317.—not three gods, but one God subsisting in three Persons. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three \"masks\" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three \"Persons\" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.\n\nIt is claimed that Pope Stephen I, St. Ambrose and Pope Nicholas I declared that baptisms in the name of \"Jesus\" only as well as in the name of \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed. Current canonical law requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.\n\nThe Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: \"baptism of blood\" and \"baptism of desire\". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are martyred for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to catechumens who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:\n\nThe Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)\n\nFor catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)\n\nThe Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: \"'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.\" As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; \"the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God\".\n\nJehovah's Witnesses\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.Jet magazine, August 4, 1955, page 26 [https://books.google.com/books?idxbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg\nPA26&dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]\n\nProspective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation elders to assess their suitability.Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182. Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.\n\nMost baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servantsThe Watchtower, May 15, 1970, page 309.\"The General Priesthood Today\", The Watchtower, March 1, 1963, page 147Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, \"Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses.\" and rarely occur at local Kingdom Halls.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1973, page 480 Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:Watchtower June 1, 1985\n\nOnly baptized males may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or revealing.\"\"God's Prophetic Word\" District Conventions\", Our Kingdom Ministry, May 1999, page 4\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, April 15, 1973, page 254–255\"Question Box\", Our Kingdom Ministry, June 1993, page 3 Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer, unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical disability.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, November 15, 1986, page 31 In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate's dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed.\"Questions From Readers\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1973, pages 479–480 In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid.\"Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands\", 1987 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 71 Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but recognized their original baptism dates.\n\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), baptism has the main purpose of remitting the sins of the participant. It is followed by confirmation, which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a baptism with the Holy Spirit. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated. It typically occurs in a baptismal font.\n\nIn addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a priest or elder). Authority is passed down through a form of apostolic succession. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or re-baptized. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their \"natural\" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.\n\nAccording to Latter-day Saint theology, faith and repentance are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of original sin, as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects infant baptismBook of Mormon,  and baptism must occur after the age of accountability, defined in Latter-day Saint scripture as eight years old.\n\nLatter-day Saint theology also teaches baptism for the dead in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in . This occurs in Latter-day Saint temples.\n\nNon-practitioners\n\nQuakers\n\nQuakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward sacraments in their religious life. Robert Barclay's Apology for the True Christian Divinity (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:\n\nBarclay argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which Quakers argue is meaningless.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe Salvation Army does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward sacraments. William Booth and Catherine Booth, the founders of the Salvation Army, believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the Salvation Army does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.\n\nHyperdispensationalism\n\nThere are some Christians termed \"Hyperdispensationalists\" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism)who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles.\"Prison epistles\" include Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's. Hyperdispensationalists assert:\n\n*The great commission[] and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.\n*The baptism of  is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of atonement for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.\n\nWater baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism foretold by John the Baptist., ,  Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.\n\nMany in this group also argue that John's promised baptism by fire is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire., , \n\nJohn, as he said \"baptized with water\", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples. Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize in contradiction to the Great Commission.cf. But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth and in Philippi,. He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection. Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.\n\nOther Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission  and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation  or the baptism of the Holy Spirit until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul. Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.\n\nComparative summary\n\nComparative Summary of Baptisms of Denominations of Christian Influence.Good News. Issue 3. St Louis, MO. 2003. pp 18–19 (This section does not give a complete listing of denominations, and therefore, it only mentions a fraction of the churches practicing \"believer's baptism\".)\n\nDebaptism\n\nMost Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be neither repeated nor undone. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by rejecting religion entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.\n\nOther initiation ceremonies\n\nMany cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the ancient Egyptian, the Hebraic/Jewish, the Babylonian, the Mayan, and the Norse cultures. The modern Japanese practice of Miyamairi is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be archaeological and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.\n\nMystery religion initiation rites\n\nApuleius, a 2nd-century Roman writer, described an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting. Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of Osiris and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Penguin Books), pp. 211–214\n\nThe water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to catechumenal practices preceding baptism in Christianity.\n\nGnostic Catholicism and Thelema\n\nThe Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of Ordo Templi Orientis), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11 years old. The ceremony is performed before a Gnostic Mass and represents a symbolic birth into the Thelemic community.\n\nBaptism of objects\n\nThe word \"baptism\" or \"christening\" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.\n*The name Baptism of Bells has been given to the blessing of (musical, especially church) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with holy water by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming censer is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.\n*Baptism of Ships: at least since the time of the Crusades, rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The ship is usually sprinkled with holy water.\n*\"Baptism of Dolls\": the custom of 'dolly dunking' was once a common practice in parts of the United Kingdom, particularly in Cornwall where it has been revived in recent years http://www.cornishman.co.uk/pictures/PICTURES-Good-Friday-dolly-dunking-Fenton/pictures-26301254-detail/pictures.html\n\nMandaean baptism\n\nMandaeans revere John the Baptist and practice frequent baptism as a ritual of purification, not of initiation.
