  "textBody" : ", also known as Emperor Tenchi, was the 38th emperor of Japan,Imperial Household Agency (Kunaichō): [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/ryobo/guide/038/index.html 天智天皇 (38)] according to the traditional order of succession.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 52.\n\nTenji's reign spanned the years from 661 through 672.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). \n\nTraditional narrative\n\nHe was the son of Emperor Jomei, but was preceded as ruler by his mother Empress Saimei.\n\nPrior to his accession, he was known as .\n\nEvents of Tenji's life\n\nAs prince, Naka no Ōe played a crucial role in ending the near-total control the Soga clan had over the imperial family. In 644, seeing the Soga continue to gain power, he conspired with Nakatomi no Kamatari and Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro to assassinate Soga no Iruka in what has come to be known as the Isshi Incident. Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka's adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no Ōe was named heir apparent. He also married the daughter of his ally Soga no Kurayamada, thus ensuring that a significant portion of the Soga clan's power was on his side.\n\nEvents of Tenji's reign\n\nNaka no Ōe reigned as Emperor Tenji from 661 to 672.\n\n* 661: In the , the empress designated her son as her heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that this son would have received the succession (senso) after her death or abdication.  Shortly after, she died, and Emperor Tenji could be said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, p. 54; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.\n* 662: Tenji is said to have compiled the first Japanese legal code known to modern historians. The Ōmi Code, consisting of 22 volumes, was promulgated in the last year of Tenji's reign.  This legal codification is no longer extant, but it is said to have been refined in what is known as the Asuka Kiyomihara ritsu-ryō of 689; and these are understood to have been a forerunner of the Taihō ritsu-ryō of 701.Varley, p. 136 n. 43.\n* 668: An account in Nihon Shoki becomes the first mention of petrochemical oil in Japan. In the , flammable water (possibly petroleum) was presented as an offering to Emperor Tenji from Echigo Province (now known as a part of Niigata Prefecture).Aston, William George. (1896).  This presentation coincided with the emperor's ceremonial confirmation as emperor.  He had postponed formalities during the period that the mausoleum of his mother was being constructed; and when the work was finished, he could delay no longer.  Up until this time, although he had been de facto monarch, he had retained the title of Crown Prince.\n\nTenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions which had been established during the Taika reforms.Asakawa, Kan'ichi. (1903). The Early Institutional Life of Japan, p. 313.\n\nDeath of the emperor\n\nFollowing his death in 672, there ensued a succession dispute between his fourteen children (many by different mothers). In the end, he was succeeded by his son, Prince Ōtomo, also known as Emperor Kōbun, then by Tenji's brother Prince Ōama, also known as Emperor Tenmu. Almost one hundred years after Tenji's death, the throne passed to his grandson Emperor Kōnin.\n\nPost-Meiji chronology\n* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (senso) after his father's death.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōbun is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Brown, Delmer et al. (1979).  Gukanshō, pp. 268–269.  If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:\n:* In the 1st year of Kōbun (672): Emperor Kōbun, in the 1st year of his reign (弘文天皇一年), died; and his uncle Ōaomi-shinnō received the succession (senso) after the death of his nephew.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Tenmu could be said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, pp. 55–58.\n\nPre-Meiji chronology\nPrior to the 19th century, Ōtomo was understood to have been a mere interloper, a pretender, an anomaly; and therefore, if that commonly accepted understanding were to have been valid, then it would have followed:\n* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , died; and despite any military confrontations which ensued, the brother of the dead sovereign would have received the succession (senso);  and after a time, it would have been understood that Emperor Tenmu rightfully acceded to the throne (sokui).\n\nThe actual site of Tenji's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Yamashina-ku, Kyoto.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenji's mausoleum.  It is formally named Yamashina no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 420.\n\nPoetry\n\nThe Man'yōshū includes poems attributed to emperors and empresses; and according to Donald Keene, evolving Man'yōshū studies have affected the interpretation of even simple narratives like \"The Three Hills.\"  The poem was long considered to be about two male hills in a quarrel over a female hill, but scholars now consider that Kagu and Mimihashi might be female hills in love with the same male hill, Unebi.Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai. (1969). The Manyōshū, p. iv.  This still-unresolved enigma in poetic form is said to have been composed by Emperor Tenji while he was still Crown Prince during the reign of Empress Saimei:\n\n::Mount Kagu strove with Mount Miminashi\n:: For the love of Mount Unebi.\n::Such is love since the age of the gods;\n::As it was thus in the early days,\n::So people strive for spouses even now.\n:::  – Emperor TenjiNippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai,  p. 5.\n\nOne of his 31-letters poems was chosen by Fujiwara no Teika as the first in the very popular anthology Hyakunin Isshu.\n\n::Aki no ta no\n::Kariho no io no\n::Toma o arami\n::Waga koromode wa\n::Tsuyu ni nure tsutsu\n:::  – Tenji Ten'nōMacCauley, Clay. (1900). \"Hyakunin-Isshu: Single Songs of a Hundred Poets\" in Transactions of the Asia Society of Japan, p. 3.\n\n:Translation:\n::Because of the coarseness of the rush-mat\n::Of the temporary-hut\n::Where the rice of autumn harvest is\n::As far as my sleeve is concerned\n::They are becoming wet with dew (or tears).\n:::  – Emperor Tenji\n\n::\n\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n\nAfter his death, his wife, Empress Yamato wrote a song of longing about her husband. Sato 2008, p. 21.\n\nKugyo\n\nThe top  during Emperor Tenji's reign included:\n\n* Daijō-daijin: , 671–672.Brown, p. 268.\n* Naishin(内臣): Fujiwara no Kamatari (藤原鎌足) (614–669), 645–669.\n\nPrince Ōtomo (Ōtomo-shinnō) was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to be accorded the title of Daijō-daijin.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 53.\n\nNon-nengō period\n\nThe years of Tenji's reign are not linked by scholars to any era or nengō.  The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – nengō – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.\n* See Japanese era name – \"Non-nengo periods\"\n* See Tenji period (661).\n\nIn this context, Brown and Ishida's translation of Gukanshō offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō's reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame:\n:\"The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was kinoto-hitsuji [695].)  ...
