  "textBody" : "Limp Bizkit is an American rap rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1994. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's elaborate live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards.\n\nFormed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville, Florida underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon after. They are currently recording their sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants.\n\nHistory \n\nFormation and early years (1994–96) \n\nFred Durst grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, \"You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'.\" Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer. Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.\n\nDurst named the band Limp Bizkit, because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, \"The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music.\" Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name. \nLimp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred [...] was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\" However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's \"Faith\" and Paula Abdul's \"Straight Up\", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.\n\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager. Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"Counterfeit\" and \"Stuck\". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer, and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.\n\nThree Dollar Bill, Yall (1997–98) \n\nAfter their performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band. After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\". The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".\n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him. Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously. The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan.\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile.\" That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled \"That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene.\"\n\nInterscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland, Oregon radio station play the song \"Counterfeit\" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as \"payola\". The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a \"brilliant marketing move\". Durst stated, \"It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing.\" Following the release of \"Counterfeit\" as a single, Three Dollar Bill, Yall was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"They might not have many original ideas [...] but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting.\" However, Robert Christgau panned the album. Despite the minimal response to his band's album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.\n\nLimp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour, performing alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon and Blink-182. Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.\n\nIn 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly's first European tour. Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success, and the second single from Three Dollar Bill, Yall, a cover of George Michael's \"Faith\", became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. In July, Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure. Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days. In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.\n\nAfter completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing, and later performed on Korn's Family Values Tour. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single \"Faith\" in promotion for its appearance in the film Very Bad Things, but was unsatisfied with it, and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones and Korn, who appeared in the video. Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the writer of the song, hated the cover and \"hates us for doing it\".\n\nSignificant Other (1999–2000) \n\nFollowing the radio success of \"Faith\", the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren't a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame. Terry Date, who had produced albums for Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen to produce the album. The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man. The song was originally titled \"Shut the Fuck Up\", but was retitled \"N 2 Gether Now\" for marketing purposes. Durst also recorded with Eminem, but the collaboration, \"Turn Me Loose\", was left off the album. The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield.\n\nSignificant Other saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines, including Spin, and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with their fans on a website established by Dike 99. Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. Significant Other was seen as an improvement over their debut, and was generally well received by critics with mixed to positive reviews.  However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in Spin and discussing Significant Other claimed that \"Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song\", and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band.\n\nThe band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago, as radio stations received a strong amount of requests for the album's first single, \"Nookie\". Significant Other climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies. On the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set. On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was later arrested on assault charges. Further criticisms of the band appeared in Rolling Stone and The New York Times. New York Times writer Ann Powers wrote, \"DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer\".\n\nIn the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock '99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song \"Break Stuff\". Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert. Durst stated during the concert, \"People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy\". Durst later stated in an interview, \"I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?\" Les Claypool told The San Francisco Examiner, \"Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy.\"\n\nDurst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single \"Re-Arranged\", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song. Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band, due to their reputation for raucous performances. Despite this controversy, Significant Other remained at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and the band headlined the year's Family Values Tour. Durst directed a music video for \"N 2 Gether Now\" which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau's fights with his butler, Cato Fong, in the Pink Panther film series.\n\nChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000–01) \n\nIn 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought he was joking about this title. The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase \"Chocolate Starfish\" refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an \"asshole\". Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.\n\nIn June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but showed up an hour late for their set. An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time. During the band's performance, Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp, calling him \"an egomaniac\". Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual. In the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster, doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing. They also did a \"Guerrilla Tour\" which involved the band setting up illegally and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.\n\nDuring the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed \"Livin' It Up\", a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying \"Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all.\" In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, \"I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man.\" In response to Durst's remark, Aguilera commented, \"He got no nookie.\"\n\nReleased on October 17, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water set a record for highest first-week sales for a rock album with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release. 400,000 of those sales happened during the first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam's Vs. Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum. The album received mixed reviews, with Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, \"Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time.\" Entertainment Weekly writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000.\n\nDuring a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit, and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor, and also the promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent. Durst stated that he was \"emotionally scarred\" because of the teenager's death.\n\nLater in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called New Old Songs.\n\nDeparture of Borland and Results May Vary (2001–03) \n\nIn October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that \"Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors.\" Durst also stated that the band would \"comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man\" to replace Borland.\n\nAfter holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist, called \"Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is\",[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451596/20011221/story.jhtml \"Limp Bizkit Scouring 99 Cities For New Guitarist\"]. MTV News, December 21, 2001; Retrieved May 31, 2006. the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith, but later scrapped their recording sessions with Smith. Durst told a fan site that he had a falling out with Smith, saying \"We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally.\"\n\nAfter recording another album without Smith, the band scrapped the new sessions and assembled a new album combining songs from different sessions. During the album's production, the working title changed from Bipolar to Panty Sniffer, and was completed under the title Results May Vary. Under Durst's sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles, and featured a cover of The Who's \"Behind Blue Eyes\", which differed from the original's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak & Spell during the song's bridge.\n\nIn the Summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica. At the tour's stop in Chicago, attendees of the concert threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting \"Fuck Fred Durst\" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, \"Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!\" until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the Sun-Times stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.\n\nResults May Vary was released on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, \"the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?\" The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, \"At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?\" Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.\n\nBorland's return, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) and hiatus (2004–08) \n\nIn August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording another album, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1).\n\nIn May, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the album, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"neo-prog alt-metal\". At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.\n Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was \"self-sabotage\": \"Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really want to put it out there.\"\n\nThe album received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it \"a step in the right direction – it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses.\" However, he felt that the band was being \"held back\" by Durst, whom he called \"the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock.\" IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the album lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.\n\nThe Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) sold over 37,000 copies worldwide, peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard 200. Following the release of the band's Greatest Hitz album, the band went on hiatus. Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to The Unquestionable Truth would be produced and that \"As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit.\"\n\nReunion, Gold Cobra and departure from Interscope (2009–11) \n\nIn 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled Gold Cobra. Borland said that the title does not have any meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album. The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album. The band also recorded additional \"non-album\" tracks, including \"Combat Jazz\", which featured rapper Raekwon and \"Middle Finger\", featuring Paul Wall. \"Shotgun\" was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for. \"Shotgun\" received favorable reviews, with Artistdirect writing, \"['Shotgun'] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on Three Dollar Bill Y'All and Significant Other with another decade-plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity, carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit.\"\n\nGold Cobra was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it \"a return to the full-throttled attack of Three Dollar Bill Y'All. IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, \"Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit's latest at least proves that their 2005 Greatest Hitz album may have been premature.\" Metal Hammer writer Terry Bezer appraised the album, writing \"Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that'll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again.\" The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album. A music video for the title track was released. Gold Cobra has sold nearly 80,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200; however, the band left Interscope after the album's release.\n\nCash Money Records, Stampede of the Disco Elephants and DJ Lethal's departure (2012–present)\n\nIn February 2012, the band returned to Australia for the first time in 11 years, to perform at the Soundwave festival. Durst dedicated the shows to Jessica Michalik, who died during the Limp Bizkit performance at Big Day Out 2001.  On February 24, Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records, and revealed plans to release a new single, \"Ready to Go\", a full-length album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants, and an EP, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 2). Due to mounting tensions and following a dispute between Durst and bandmates Lethal and Otto about the latter two's alleged chronic drug and alcohol use, DJ Lethal angrily left the band.\n\nFred Durst was featured in the song \"Champions\" by Kevin Rudolf, used as theme for WWE's Night of Champions. The song debuted on WWE Raw televised event on September 3, 2012. This is the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2003. On October 11, 2012, DJ Lethal posted an apology to the band on Twitter, but was ultimately not allowed back into the band.\nIt was announced on October 26, 2012 on Fred Durst's official Twitter account that a video for the first Cash Money single with Lil Wayne, \"Ready to Go\" was currently being filmed. Limp Bizkit also \"leaked\" a new song on the web called \"Lightz (City of Angels)\" via YouTube. The band is currently recording their seventh studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced the band's debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall, and their 2005 album The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). The album was scheduled for a July 2014 release.\n\nOn March 24, 2013, the first single from the album, \"Ready to Go\" (featuring Lil Wayne) was released on limpbizkit.com and the accompanying music video was released on July 22.Ready to Go music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyAAwCu-Lu4\n\nIn April 2013, the band announced 34 tour dates, 25 being in the U.S. Their touring schedule included Welcome to Rockville, the Carolina Rebellion, Rock Am Ring in Germany, and Rome.\n\nOn November 1, 2013, a new track from the album, a cover of the Ministry song \"Thieves\" was released by the band via their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. On December 11, the band released a new single, the previously leaked song, \"Lightz\" along with an accompanying music video.\n\nThe next single off the album, \"Endless Slaughter\" was originally set to be released only on cassette and during concerts, beginning from June 2014 in Europe and culminating at Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit will perform along with festival founders Slipknot, and Korn, Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames, however the single currently can be streamed and downloaded at the band's official website.\n\nIn October 2014, Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money, and became independent again. The split was carried out amicably, and Fred says that \"We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne, though. We love that song.\" (the song \"Ready to Go\").\n\nThe band started its 2015 activities with news: Stampede of the Disco Elephants is in the final stages of production, however as of 2016 no news has come of release of the album. A few days later, the band announced their major 2015 tour called \"Money Sucks\" (for which Stanislav Lanovoy was videographer), a Russian 20-date tour to take place during October and November, celebrating the 20th anniversary of Limp Bizkit. The tour name is a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time.\n\nLimp Bizkit was leading ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some days before the event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: \"Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA impressions in the top deck mosh pit.\" Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying \"When I first read the description of the cruise I realized it is what it is and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe. I'm turning 40 next week and I think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [30s] on ShipRocked. It's funny to me. It's a joke with truth in it. I just don't want our fans to get all butthurt and thinking I'm criticising them, because I'm not.\"\n\nBefore the band travel to Europe to attend some shows and the \"Money Sucks\" Tour through Russia, Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the discs of the spine and that was complicated due to a pinched nerve, causing a lot of pain in such area, which has prevented him from being with the band. Through the Armpit.net forums Sam offers this statement, adding that he will have surgery, following for rehabilitation. Bass duties are covered by Samuel Gerhard Mpungu.\n\nLimp Bizkit will offer several concerts in UK during winter 2016 alongside Korn, two of the most prominent nu metal acts from 1990s. Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: \"You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favorite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!\"\n\nBecause of little information and constant delays for the release of Stampede, in an interview/talk with the podcast \"Someone Who Isn't Me\", Wes says that Fred \"isn't happy\" with what he is working on. The original idea was to follow the spirit of Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique album, but Borland commented that right now he doesn't know exactly what Durst's idea is. The guitarist says that he (Durst) will \"just keep working on something until he's happy with it, even if it takes years and years\".\n\nStyle, influences, and legacy \n\nMusic, influences, and lyrics \n\nDurst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a \"megaband\" which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible. Limp Bizkit's music has predominately been described as , (March 20, 2009). Retrieved on September 22, 2015  and rap rock. Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal, alternative rock and . In 2000, the New York Daily News labelled the band as \"frat-metal\".\n\nLimp Bizkit's music is noted for its \"kinetic, frenzied energy\". Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk. DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\" Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. Three Dollar Bill, Yall features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. The song \"Stuck\" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.\n\nAllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that their album, Significant Other, contains \"flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers\" and \"swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background\". The band did not employ solos until Gold Cobra (except for the song \"Underneath The Gun\" out of Results May Vary), however, during the recording of Significant Other, drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song \"Nobody Like You\". Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The song \"Sour\", from the album Three Dollar Bill, Yall, was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend. His breakup with her inspired the Significant Other songs \"Nookie\" and . When describing Limp Bizkit's lyrics, The Michigan Daily said \"In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs.\" (October 21, 2008). Retrieved on October 25, 2015 Furthermore, Limp Bizkit's lyrics were described as \"misogynistic\". (October 13, 2000). Retrieved on October 25, 2015 The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.\n\nInfluences cited by the band on Limp Bizkit's music include Tool and Korn. Durst has also said that Pantera \"motivated him\" to form Limp Bizkit.\n\nAwards and recognition \n\nLimp Bizkit has been nominated for and won several awards. Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Nookie\"), Best Rock Album (Significant Other), and Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Take A Look Around\"). Limp Bizkit has been nominated for 3 American Music Awards for Favorite Alternative Artist winning one of them in 2002.\n\nIn 1999, the band won the Maximum Vision Award at the Billboard Music Video Awards for their music video \"Nookie\". At the 2000 and 2001 Blockbuster Awards, the band won the Favorite Group (Rock) award. That year also saw the band winning a MuchMusic Award for Best International Video, honoring their video for the song \"Break Stuff\". At the 2001 ECHO Awards, the band won the Best International Metal Band award.Wolfgang Spahr - \"Echoes Debuts in Berlin\" -  [https://books.google.com/books?id\nfhQEAAAAMBAJ&lpgPA8&dq\nbillboard%202001%20march%2031%20echoes%20debut%20in%20berlin%20by%20wolfgang%20spahr&pgPA8#v\nonepage&qbillboard%202001%20march%2031%20echoes%20debut%20in%20berlin%20by%20wolfgang%20spahr&f\nfalse Billboard 2001-03-31 p8 continued p82]. Retrieved February 26, 2016 At the 2009 Kerrang! Awards, the band won the Hall of Fame award. Further expanding upon the group's achievements and popularity, they were also the first group inducted into MTV's Total Request Live \"Hall of Fame\" on May 26, 2001.\n\nRichard Cheese performed a lounge rendition of the songs \"Nookie\" and \"Break Stuff\" on his debut album, Lounge Against the Machine. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Angry White Boy Polka\" medley included Limp Bizkit's song \"My Way\". The Vitamin String Quartet recorded a tribute album called The String Quartet Tribute to Limp Bizkit: Break Stuff, which contains reinterpretations of the band's songs performed by a violinist backed by cellos, synthesizers, and keyboard percussion. Girl Talk sampled \"Nookie\" and \"Break Stuff\" in the song \"Friends-4-Ever\", which appears on his album Secret Diary. The Blackout covered \"My Generation\" for the compilation Higher Voltage!: Another Brief History of Rock. Bands citing Limp Bizkit as an influence on their music incclude the progressive metal band Proyecto Eskhata.\n\nWhile Limp Bizkit's popularity has declined in the USA since the mid-2000s, it has been noted in the media that the band still remains highly popular in Russia.\n\nLive performances \n\nBorland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a \"burnt match\". Describing the character, he stated, \"I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.\" Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.\n\nIn addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan \"Primus sucks\": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, \"they finger us back—and you know what that means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'\"\n\nDuring the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30-foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by \"flushing\" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the Los Angeles Times described as \"a mix of The War Of The Worlds and Mars Attacks\". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career.\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent\n* Fred Durst – lead vocals (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* Sam Rivers – bass, backing vocals (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* John Otto – drums, percussion (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* Wes Borland – guitars, backing vocals (1995–2001, 2004–2006, 2009–present)\n\nCurrent touring musicians\n* Franko Carino – sampling, programming, backing vocals (2013–present)[http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/live-review-limp-bizkit-revolution-live-fort-lauderdale/10490932 Live Review: Limp Bizkit - Revolution Live, Fort Lauderdale @ARTISTdirect].

    "aggregatedText" : "Limp Bizkit is an American rap rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1994. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's elaborate live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards.\n\nFormed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville, Florida underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon after. They are currently recording their sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants.\n\nHistory \n\nFormation and early years (1994–96) \n\nFred Durst grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, \"You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'.\" Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer. Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.\n\nDurst named the band Limp Bizkit, because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, \"The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music.\" Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name. \nLimp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred [...] was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\" However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's \"Faith\" and Paula Abdul's \"Straight Up\", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.\n\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager. Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"Counterfeit\" and \"Stuck\". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer, and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.\n\nThree Dollar Bill, Yall (1997–98) \n\nAfter their performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band. After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\". The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".\n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him. Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously. The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan.\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile.\" That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled \"That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene.\"\n\nInterscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland, Oregon radio station play the song \"Counterfeit\" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as \"payola\". The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a \"brilliant marketing move\". Durst stated, \"It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing.\" Following the release of \"Counterfeit\" as a single, Three Dollar Bill, Yall was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"They might not have many original ideas [...] but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting.\" However, Robert Christgau panned the album. Despite the minimal response to his band's album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.\n\nLimp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour, performing alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon and Blink-182. Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.\n\nIn 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly's first European tour. Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success, and the second single from Three Dollar Bill, Yall, a cover of George Michael's \"Faith\", became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. In July, Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure. Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days. In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.\n\nAfter completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing, and later performed on Korn's Family Values Tour. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single \"Faith\" in promotion for its appearance in the film Very Bad Things, but was unsatisfied with it, and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones and Korn, who appeared in the video. Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the writer of the song, hated the cover and \"hates us for doing it\".\n\nSignificant Other (1999–2000) \n\nFollowing the radio success of \"Faith\", the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren't a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame. Terry Date, who had produced albums for Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen to produce the album. The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man. The song was originally titled \"Shut the Fuck Up\", but was retitled \"N 2 Gether Now\" for marketing purposes. Durst also recorded with Eminem, but the collaboration, \"Turn Me Loose\", was left off the album. The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield.\n\nSignificant Other saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines, including Spin, and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with their fans on a website established by Dike 99. Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. Significant Other was seen as an improvement over their debut, and was generally well received by critics with mixed to positive reviews.  However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in Spin and discussing Significant Other claimed that \"Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song\", and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band.\n\nThe band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago, as radio stations received a strong amount of requests for the album's first single, \"Nookie\". Significant Other climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies. On the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set. On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was later arrested on assault charges. Further criticisms of the band appeared in Rolling Stone and The New York Times. New York Times writer Ann Powers wrote, \"DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer\".\n\nIn the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock '99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song \"Break Stuff\". Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert. Durst stated during the concert, \"People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy\". Durst later stated in an interview, \"I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?\" Les Claypool told The San Francisco Examiner, \"Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy.\"\n\nDurst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single \"Re-Arranged\", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song. Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band, due to their reputation for raucous performances. Despite this controversy, Significant Other remained at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and the band headlined the year's Family Values Tour. Durst directed a music video for \"N 2 Gether Now\" which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau's fights with his butler, Cato Fong, in the Pink Panther film series.\n\nChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000–01) \n\nIn 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought he was joking about this title. The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase \"Chocolate Starfish\" refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an \"asshole\". Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.\n\nIn June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but showed up an hour late for their set. An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time. During the band's performance, Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp, calling him \"an egomaniac\". Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual. In the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster, doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing. They also did a \"Guerrilla Tour\" which involved the band setting up illegally and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.\n\nDuring the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed \"Livin' It Up\", a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying \"Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all.\" In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, \"I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man.\" In response to Durst's remark, Aguilera commented, \"He got no nookie.\"\n\nReleased on October 17, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water set a record for highest first-week sales for a rock album with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release. 400,000 of those sales happened during the first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam's Vs. Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum. The album received mixed reviews, with Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, \"Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time.\" Entertainment Weekly writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000.\n\nDuring a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit, and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor, and also the promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent. Durst stated that he was \"emotionally scarred\" because of the teenager's death.\n\nLater in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called New Old Songs.\n\nDeparture of Borland and Results May Vary (2001–03) \n\nIn October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that \"Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors.\" Durst also stated that the band would \"comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man\" to replace Borland.\n\nAfter holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist, called \"Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is\",[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451596/20011221/story.jhtml \"Limp Bizkit Scouring 99 Cities For New Guitarist\"]. MTV News, December 21, 2001; Retrieved May 31, 2006. the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith, but later scrapped their recording sessions with Smith. Durst told a fan site that he had a falling out with Smith, saying \"We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally.\"\n\nAfter recording another album without Smith, the band scrapped the new sessions and assembled a new album combining songs from different sessions. During the album's production, the working title changed from Bipolar to Panty Sniffer, and was completed under the title Results May Vary. Under Durst's sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles, and featured a cover of The Who's \"Behind Blue Eyes\", which differed from the original's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak & Spell during the song's bridge.\n\nIn the Summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica. At the tour's stop in Chicago, attendees of the concert threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting \"Fuck Fred Durst\" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, \"Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!\" until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the Sun-Times stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.\n\nResults May Vary was released on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, \"the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?\" The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, \"At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?\" Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.\n\nBorland's return, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) and hiatus (2004–08) \n\nIn August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording another album, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1).\n\nIn May, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the album, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"neo-prog alt-metal\". At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.\n Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was \"self-sabotage\": \"Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really want to put it out there.\"\n\nThe album received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it \"a step in the right direction – it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses.\" However, he felt that the band was being \"held back\" by Durst, whom he called \"the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock.\" IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the album lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.\n\nThe Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) sold over 37,000 copies worldwide, peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard 200. Following the release of the band's Greatest Hitz album, the band went on hiatus. Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to The Unquestionable Truth would be produced and that \"As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit.\"\n\nReunion, Gold Cobra and departure from Interscope (2009–11) \n\nIn 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled Gold Cobra. Borland said that the title does not have any meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album. The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album. The band also recorded additional \"non-album\" tracks, including \"Combat Jazz\", which featured rapper Raekwon and \"Middle Finger\", featuring Paul Wall. \"Shotgun\" was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for. \"Shotgun\" received favorable reviews, with Artistdirect writing, \"['Shotgun'] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on Three Dollar Bill Y'All and Significant Other with another decade-plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity, carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit.\"\n\nGold Cobra was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it \"a return to the full-throttled attack of Three Dollar Bill Y'All. IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, \"Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit's latest at least proves that their 2005 Greatest Hitz album may have been premature.\" Metal Hammer writer Terry Bezer appraised the album, writing \"Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that'll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again.\" The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album. A music video for the title track was released. Gold Cobra has sold nearly 80,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200; however, the band left Interscope after the album's release.\n\nCash Money Records, Stampede of the Disco Elephants and DJ Lethal's departure (2012–present)\n\nIn February 2012, the band returned to Australia for the first time in 11 years, to perform at the Soundwave festival. Durst dedicated the shows to Jessica Michalik, who died during the Limp Bizkit performance at Big Day Out 2001.  On February 24, Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records, and revealed plans to release a new single, \"Ready to Go\", a full-length album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants, and an EP, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 2). Due to mounting tensions and following a dispute between Durst and bandmates Lethal and Otto about the latter two's alleged chronic drug and alcohol use, DJ Lethal angrily left the band.\n\nFred Durst was featured in the song \"Champions\" by Kevin Rudolf, used as theme for WWE's Night of Champions. The song debuted on WWE Raw televised event on September 3, 2012. This is the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2003. On October 11, 2012, DJ Lethal posted an apology to the band on Twitter, but was ultimately not allowed back into the band.\nIt was announced on October 26, 2012 on Fred Durst's official Twitter account that a video for the first Cash Money single with Lil Wayne, \"Ready to Go\" was currently being filmed. Limp Bizkit also \"leaked\" a new song on the web called \"Lightz (City of Angels)\" via YouTube. The band is currently recording their seventh studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced the band's debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall, and their 2005 album The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). The album was scheduled for a July 2014 release.\n\nOn March 24, 2013, the first single from the album, \"Ready to Go\" (featuring Lil Wayne) was released on limpbizkit.com and the accompanying music video was released on July 22.Ready to Go music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyAAwCu-Lu4\n\nIn April 2013, the band announced 34 tour dates, 25 being in the U.S. Their touring schedule included Welcome to Rockville, the Carolina Rebellion, Rock Am Ring in Germany, and Rome.\n\nOn November 1, 2013, a new track from the album, a cover of the Ministry song \"Thieves\" was released by the band via their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. On December 11, the band released a new single, the previously leaked song, \"Lightz\" along with an accompanying music video.\n\nThe next single off the album, \"Endless Slaughter\" was originally set to be released only on cassette and during concerts, beginning from June 2014 in Europe and culminating at Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit will perform along with festival founders Slipknot, and Korn, Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames, however the single currently can be streamed and downloaded at the band's official website.\n\nIn October 2014, Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money, and became independent again. The split was carried out amicably, and Fred says that \"We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne, though. We love that song.\" (the song \"Ready to Go\").\n\nThe band started its 2015 activities with news: Stampede of the Disco Elephants is in the final stages of production, however as of 2016 no news has come of release of the album. A few days later, the band announced their major 2015 tour called \"Money Sucks\" (for which Stanislav Lanovoy was videographer), a Russian 20-date tour to take place during October and November, celebrating the 20th anniversary of Limp Bizkit. The tour name is a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time.\n\nLimp Bizkit was leading ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some days before the event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: \"Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA impressions in the top deck mosh pit.\" Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying \"When I first read the description of the cruise I realized it is what it is and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe. I'm turning 40 next week and I think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [30s] on ShipRocked. It's funny to me. It's a joke with truth in it. I just don't want our fans to get all butthurt and thinking I'm criticising them, because I'm not.\"\n\nBefore the band travel to Europe to attend some shows and the \"Money Sucks\" Tour through Russia, Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the discs of the spine and that was complicated due to a pinched nerve, causing a lot of pain in such area, which has prevented him from being with the band. Through the Armpit.net forums Sam offers this statement, adding that he will have surgery, following for rehabilitation. Bass duties are covered by Samuel Gerhard Mpungu.\n\nLimp Bizkit will offer several concerts in UK during winter 2016 alongside Korn, two of the most prominent nu metal acts from 1990s. Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: \"You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favorite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!\"\n\nBecause of little information and constant delays for the release of Stampede, in an interview/talk with the podcast \"Someone Who Isn't Me\", Wes says that Fred \"isn't happy\" with what he is working on. The original idea was to follow the spirit of Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique album, but Borland commented that right now he doesn't know exactly what Durst's idea is. The guitarist says that he (Durst) will \"just keep working on something until he's happy with it, even if it takes years and years\".\n\nStyle, influences, and legacy \n\nMusic, influences, and lyrics \n\nDurst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a \"megaband\" which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible. Limp Bizkit's music has predominately been described as , (March 20, 2009). Retrieved on September 22, 2015  and rap rock. Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal, alternative rock and . In 2000, the New York Daily News labelled the band as \"frat-metal\".\n\nLimp Bizkit's music is noted for its \"kinetic, frenzied energy\". Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk. DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\" Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. Three Dollar Bill, Yall features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. The song \"Stuck\" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.\n\nAllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that their album, Significant Other, contains \"flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers\" and \"swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background\". The band did not employ solos until Gold Cobra (except for the song \"Underneath The Gun\" out of Results May Vary), however, during the recording of Significant Other, drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song \"Nobody Like You\". Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The song \"Sour\", from the album Three Dollar Bill, Yall, was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend. His breakup with her inspired the Significant Other songs \"Nookie\" and . When describing Limp Bizkit's lyrics, The Michigan Daily said \"In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs.\" (October 21, 2008). Retrieved on October 25, 2015 Furthermore, Limp Bizkit's lyrics were described as \"misogynistic\". (October 13, 2000). Retrieved on October 25, 2015 The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.\n\nInfluences cited by the band on Limp Bizkit's music include Tool and Korn. Durst has also said that Pantera \"motivated him\" to form Limp Bizkit.\n\nAwards and recognition \n\nLimp Bizkit has been nominated for and won several awards. Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Nookie\"), Best Rock Album (Significant Other), and Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Take A Look Around\"). Limp Bizkit has been nominated for 3 American Music Awards for Favorite Alternative Artist winning one of them in 2002.\n\nIn 1999, the band won the Maximum Vision Award at the Billboard Music Video Awards for their music video \"Nookie\".

That year also saw the band winning a MuchMusic Award for Best International Video, honoring their video for the song \"Break Stuff\".

Retrieved February 26, 2016 At the 2009 Kerrang! Awards, the band won the Hall of Fame award. Further expanding upon the group's achievements and popularity, they were also the first group inducted into MTV's Total Request Live \"Hall of Fame\" on May 26, 2001.\n\nRichard Cheese performed a lounge rendition of the songs \"Nookie\" and \"Break Stuff\" on his debut album, Lounge Against the Machine. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Angry White Boy Polka\" medley included Limp Bizkit's song \"My Way\". The Vitamin String Quartet recorded a tribute album called The String Quartet Tribute to Limp Bizkit: Break Stuff, which contains reinterpretations of the band's songs performed by a violinist backed by cellos, synthesizers, and keyboard percussion. Girl Talk sampled \"Nookie\" and \"Break Stuff\" in the song \"Friends-4-Ever\", which appears on his album Secret Diary. The Blackout covered \"My Generation\" for the compilation Higher Voltage!: Another Brief History of Rock. Bands citing Limp Bizkit as an influence on their music incclude the progressive metal band Proyecto Eskhata.\n\nWhile Limp Bizkit's popularity has declined in the USA since the mid-2000s, it has been noted in the media that the band still remains highly popular in Russia.\n\nLive performances \n\nBorland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a \"burnt match\". Describing the character, he stated, \"I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.\" Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.\n\nIn addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan \"Primus sucks\": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, \"they finger us back—and you know what that means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'\"\n\nDuring the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30-foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by \"flushing\" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the Los Angeles Times described as \"a mix of The War Of The Worlds and Mars Attacks\". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career.\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent\n* Fred Durst – lead vocals (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* Sam Rivers – bass, backing vocals (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* John Otto – drums, percussion (1994–2006, 2009–present)\n* Wes Borland – guitars, backing vocals (1995–2001, 2004–2006, 2009–present)\n\nCurrent touring musicians\n* Franko Carino – sampling, programming, backing vocals (2013–present)[http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/live-review-limp-bizkit-revolution-live-fort-lauderdale/10490932 Live Review: Limp Bizkit - Revolution Live, Fort Lauderdale @ARTISTdirect].
