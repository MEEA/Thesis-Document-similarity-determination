According to estimates in 2015, the population of Kabul is 4.635 million, which includes all the major ethnic groups. Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world's 64th largest city.\n\nKabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains, with an elevation of 1790 m making it one of the highest capitals in the world. The city is said to be over 3,500 years old, mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. It is at a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia, and a key location of the ancient Silk Road. It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids, Mauryans, Kushans, Kabul Shahis, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khwarazmians, Qarlughids, Khaljis, Timurids, Mughals, and Hotaks, until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire (also known as the \"Afghan Empire\") in 1747. Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776, during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani, the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the British occupied the city but after establishing foreign relations they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan. The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed. A civil war in the 1990s between various rebel groups destroyed much of the city, resulting in many casualties. \n\nKabul is known for its historical gardens, quaint bazaars, and vast amount of palaces.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reversing-kabuls-environmental-setbacks-sayed-aziz-azimihttp://afghanistantimes.af/kabul-city-isnt-just-capital-of-afghanistan-but-of-palaces-as-well/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-capital/once-called-paradise-now-kabul-struggles-to-cope-idUSSP20888220070416 It was also formerly a mecca for young western hippies.Dateline Mongolia: An American Journalist in Nomad's Land by Michael Kohnhttps://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20160830_OTS0058/mein-kabul-orf-reporterlegende-fritz-orter-praesentiert-im-weltjournal-seine-stadt-am-31-august-um-2230-uhr-in-orf-2 Since the removal of the Taliban from power in late 2001, the city gradually began rebuilding itself with assistance from the international community. Despite the many terrorist attacks by anti-state elements, the city is greatly developing and was the fifth fastest-growing city in the world as of 2012. The city is divided into 22 districts.\n\nToponymy\n\nKabul (;  ',;  ',),See [http://www.nationalreview.com/nordlinger/nordlinger112002.asp National Review, November 20, 2002], [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kabul Merriam-Webster: Kabul] also spelled Cabool, Caubul, Kabol, or Cabul.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\n \nThe actual origin of Kabul, who built it and when, is unknown. In the Hindu book Rigveda, composed between 1700–1100 BCE, one of the four canonical sacred texts (śruti) of Hinduism, and the Avesta, the primary collection of sacred texts of Zoroastrianism; in these sources, Kabul is referred to as Kubha.Adamec, p.231 The book calls it an \"ideal city\" and is full of poems in praise of the city. The area in which the city sits was ruled by Medes though much information is not available about it.  refers to the Kabul River. The Rigveda praises it as an ideal city, a vision of paradise set in the mountains. The area in which the Kabul valley sits was ruled by the Medes before falling to the Achaemenids.\n\nIn the 6th century BCE, the city fell to the Achaemenid Empire. During that period, Kabul became a center of learning for Zoroastrianism which was followed by Buddhism and Hinduism. There is a reference to a settlement called Kabura by the rulers of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nWhen Alexander annexed the Achaemenid Empire, the Kabul region came under his control. After his death, his empire was seized by his general Seleucus, becoming part of the Seleucid Empire. In 305 BCE, he extended his empire all the way to the Indus river, which caused a friction with the neighboring Mauryan Empire. It is widely believed that the two empires reached an alliance treaty. During the Mauryan period, trade flourished because of uniform weights and measures. Irrigation facilities for public use were developed leading to an increased harvest of crops. People were also employed as artisans, jewelers, carpenters.Romano, p.12\n\nThe Greco-Bactrians took control of Kabul from the Mauryans in the early 2nd century BC, then lost the city to their subordinates in the Indo-Greek Kingdom around the mid-2nd century BC. Buddhism was greatly patronized by the rulers and majority of people of the city were adherents of the religion. Indo-Scythians expelled the Indo-Greeks by the mid 1st century BC, but lost the city to the Kushan Empire about 100 years later.\n\nSome historians ascribe Kabul the Sanskrit name of Kamboja (Kamboj). It is mentioned as Kophes or Kophene in some classical writings. Hsuan Tsang refers to the name as Kaofu in the 7th century AD, which is the appellation of one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi who had migrated from across the Hindu Kush into the Kabul valley around the beginning of the Christian era. It was conquered by Kushan Emperor Kujula Kadphises in about 45 AD and remained Kushan territory until at least the 3rd century AD.Hill, John E. 2004. The Peoples of the West from the Weilue 魏略 by Yu Huan 魚豢: A Third Century Chinese Account Composed between 239 and 265 AD. Draft annotated English translation... [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/weilue.html Link]Hill (2004), pp. 29, 352–352. The Kushans were Indo-European-speaking Tocharians from the Tarim Basin.A. D. H. Bivar, [http://iranicaonline.org/articles/kushan-dynasty-i-history KUSHAN DYNASTY], in Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2010\n\nAround 230 AD, the Kushans were defeated by the Sassanid Empire and replaced by Sassanid vassals known as the Indo-Sassanids. During the Sassanian period, the city was referred to as \"Kapul\" in Pahlavi scripts. In 420 AD the Indo-Sassanids were driven out of Afghanistan by the Xionite tribe known as the Kidarites, who were then replaced in the 460s by the Hephthalites. It became part of the surviving Turk Shahi Kingdom of Kapisa, also known as Kabul-Shahan. According to Táríkhu-l Hind by Al-Biruni, Kabul was governed by princes of Turkic lineage whose rule lasted for about 60 generations.\n\nThe Kabul rulers built a long defensive wall around the city to protect it from enemy raids. This historical wall has survived until today. It was briefly held by Tibetan Empire between 801 and 815.\n\nIslamization and Mongol invasion\n\n \nThe Islamic conquest reached modern-day Afghanistan in 642 AD, at a time when Kabul was independent. A number of failed expeditions were made to Islamize the region. In one of them, Abdur Rahman bin Samana arrived to Kabul from Zaranj in the late 600s and managed to convert 12,000 local inhabitants to Islam before abandoning the city. Muslims were a minority until Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar of Zaranj conquered Kabul in 870 and established the first Islamic dynasty in the region. It was reported that the rulers of Kabul were Muslims with non-Muslims living close by.\n\nOver the following centuries, the city was successively controlled by the Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khwarazmshahs, Qarlughids, and Khaljis. In the 13th century, the invading Mongols caused major destruction in the region. Report of a massacre in the close by Bamiyan is recorded around this period, where the entire population of the valley was annihilated by the Mongol troops as a revenge for the death of Genghis Khan's grandson. As a result, many natives of Afghanistan fled south toward the Indian subcontinent where some established dynasties in Delhi. The Chagatai Khanate and Kartids were vassals of Ilkhanate till dissolution of latter in 1335.\n\nFollowing the era of the Khalji dynasty in 1333, the famous Moroccan scholar Ibn Battuta was visiting Kabul and wrote:\n\nTimurid and Mughal era\n\nIn the 14th century, Kabul became a major trading center under the kingdom of Timur (Tamerlane). In 1504, the city fell to Babur from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later Mughal Empire. In 1525, Babur described Kabulistan in his memoirs by writing that:\n\nMirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, a poet from Hindustan who visited at the time wrote: \"Dine and drink in Kabul: it is mountain, desert, city, river and all else.\" It was from here that Babur began his 1526 conquest of Hindustan, which was ruled by the Afghan Lodi dynasty and began east of the Indus River in what is present-day Pakistan. Babur loved Kabul due to the fact that he lived in it for 20 years and the people were loyal to him, including its weather that he was used to. His wish to be buried in Kabul was finally granted. The inscription on his tomb contains the famous Persian couplet, which states: اگرفردوس روی زمین است همین است و همین است و همین است (If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!)\n\nDurrani Empire\n\nNine years after Nader Shah and his forces invaded and occupied the city as part of the more easternmost parts of his Empire, he was assassinated by his own officers, causing the rapid disintegration of it. Ahmad Shah Durrani, commander of 4,000 Abdali Afghans, asserted Pashtun rule in 1747 and further expanded his new Afghan Empire. His ascension to power marked the beginning of Afghanistan. His son Timur Shah Durrani, after inheriting power, transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776, and used Peshawar in what is today Pakistan as the winter capital. Timur Shah died in 1793 and was succeeded by his son Zaman Shah Durrani. Kabul's first visitor from Europe was Englishman George Forster, who described 18th-century Kabul as \"the best and cleanest city in South Asia\".\n\nIn 1826, the kingdom was claimed by Dost Mohammad Khan but in 1839 Shujah Shah Durrani was re-installed with the help of British India during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In 1841 a local uprising resulted in the killing of the British resident and loss of mission in Kabul and the 1842 retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad. In 1842 the British returned to Kabul, plundering Bala Hissar in revenge before fleeing back to British India (now Pakistan). Akbar Khan took to the throne from 1842 to 1845 and was followed by Dost Mohammad Khan.\n\nThe British-led Indian forces invaded in 1879 when Kabul was under Sher Ali Khan's rule, as the Afghan king initially refused to accept British diplomatic mission and later the British residents were again massacred. The British partially destroyed Bala Hissar fortress before retreating to British India.\n\n20th century\n\nHaving become an established bazaar city, leather and textile industries developed by 1916.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf\n\nIn the early 20th century King Amanullah Khan rose to power. His reforms included electricity for the city and schooling for girls. He drove a Rolls-Royce, and lived in the famous Darul Aman Palace. In 1919, after the Third Anglo-Afghan War, Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from foreign affairs at Eidgah Mosque. In 1929 King Ammanullah left Kabul due to a local uprising orchestrated by Habibullah Kalakani. After nine months rule, Kalakani was imprisoned and executed by King Nader Khan. Three years later, in 1933, the new king was assassinated by a Hazara student Abdul Khaliq during an award ceremony inside a school in Kabul. The throne was left to his 19-year-old son, Zahir Shah, who became the last King of Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the inter-war period France and Germany worked to help develop the country and maintained high schools and lycees in the capital, providing education for the children of the city's elite families.Anthony Hyman, \"Nationalism in Afghanistan\" in International Journal of Middle East Studies, 34:2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 305. Kabul University opened in 1932 and by the 1960s western educated Afghans made up the majority of teachers.Hyman, 305. By the 1960s the majority of instructors at the university had degrees from Western universities.\n\nWhen Zahir Shah took power in 1933 Kabul had the only 6 mi of rail in the country and the country had few internal telegraphs, phone lines or roads. Zahir turned to the Japanese, Germans and Italians for help developing a modern transportation and communication network.Nick Cullather, \"Damming Afghanistan: Modernization in a Buffer State\" in The Journal of American History 89:2 (Indiana: Organization of American Historians, 2002) 518. A radio tower built by the Germans in 1937 in Kabul allowing instant communication with outlying villages.Cullather, 518. A national bank and state cartels were organized to allow for economic modernization.Cullather, 519. Textile mills, power plants, carpet and furniture factories were also built in Kabul, providing much needed manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, urbanization accelerated and the built-up area was increased to 68 km² by 1962, an almost fourteen-fold increase compared to 1925.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf\n\nIn 1955, the Soviet Union forwarded $100 million in credit to Afghanistan, which financed public transportation, airports, a cement factory, mechanized bakery, a five-lane highway from Kabul to the Soviet border and dams.Cullather, 530.\n\nIn the 1960s the first Marks & Spencer store in Central Asia was built in the city. Kabul Zoo was inaugurated in 1967, which was maintained with the help of visiting German zoologists. Many foreigners began flocking to Kabul and the nation's tourism industry was starting to pick up speed. Kabul experimented with liberalization, dropping laws requiring women to wear burkas, restrictions on speech and assembly were loosened which led to student politics in the capital.Cullather, 534. Socialist, Maoist and liberal factions demonstrated daily in Kabul while more traditional Islamic leaders spoke out against the failure to aid the Afghan countryside. From the 1960s until the late 1970s, Kabul was a major stop on the famous Hippie trail.\n\nIn 1969 a religious uprising at the Pul-e Khishti Mosque protested the Soviet Union's increasing influence over Afghan politics and religion. This protest ended in the arrest of many of its organizers, including Mawlana Faizani, a popular Islamic scholar. In the early 1970s Radio Kabul began to broadcast in other languages besides Pashto which helped to unify those minorities that often felt marginalized. However this was put to a stop after Daoud Khan, the King's cousin and former Prime Minister, launched a coup in July 1973Hyman, \"Nationalism in Afghanistan\", 307. which deposed the King and took over power. This was supported by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a pro-Soviet political party. Daoud named himself President and planned to institute reforms.John E. Haynes, \"Keeping Cool About Kabul\" in World Affairs, 145:4 (Washington, D.C.: Heldref Publications, 1983), 371. The BBC has described the period before the April 1978 Revolution as an era when different ethnic groups of Afghanistan lived together harmoniously, intermarried and mixed socially.\n\nBy 1975, the young Ahmad Shah Massoud and his followers initiated an uprising in Panjshir but were forced to flee to neighboring Pakistan where they received recruitment from Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to create unrest in Afghanistan with the help of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). It is claimed that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 Saur Revolution in Kabul by making Daoud spread his armed forces to the countryside. \"To launch this plan, Bhutto recruited and trained a group of Afghans in the Bala-Hesar of Peshawar, in Pakistan's North-west Frontier Province. Among these young men were Massoud, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and other members of Jawanan-e Musulman. Massoud's mission to Bhutto was to create unrest in northern Afghanistan. It served Massoud's interests, which were apparently opposition to the Soviets and independence for Afghanistan. Later, after Massoud and Hekmatyar had a terrible falling-out over Massoud's opposition to terrorist tactics and methods, Massoud overthrew from Jawanan-e Musulman. He joined Rabani's newly created Afghan political party, Jamiat-i-Islami, in exile in Pakistan.\"\n\nSoviet occupation\n\nOn April 28, 1978, President Daoud and most of his family were assassinated in Kabul, in what is called the Saur Revolution. Pro-Soviet PDPA under Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and slowly began to institute reforms.Haynes, 372. Private businesses were nationalized in the Soviet manner.Haynes, 373. Education was modified into the Soviet model, with lessons focusing on teaching Russian, Marxism-Leninism and learning of other countries belonging to the Soviet bloc. Foreign-backed rebel groups and army deserters took up arms in the name of Islam.\n\nIn February 1979, U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs was murdered after Afghan security forces burst in on his kidnappers. In neighboring Pakistan, President Zulfiqar Bhutto was executed in April 1979. In September 1979 Afghan President Taraki was assassinated by his rival Hafizullah Amin, who in turn was assassinated in December 1979 by a team of Soviet Spetsnaz inside the Tajbeg Palace in Kabul. On December 24, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and Kabul was heavily occupied by Soviet Armed Forces. Following this invasion, Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq chaired a meeting in Islamabad and was told by several cabinet members to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan, owing to the vastly superior military power of the Soviet Union. However, Zia-ul-Haq, fearing that the Soviets may be advancing into Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, made no secret about his intentions of aiding the mujahideen rebel groups. During this meeting, Director-General of the ISI Akhtar Abdur Rahman advocated for the idea of covert operation in Afghanistan by arming the Islamic extremists. General Rahman was heard loudly saying: \"Kabul must burn! Kabul must burn!\", and mastered the idea of proxy war in Afghanistan. President Zia-ul-Haq authorised this operation under General Rahman, and it was later merged with Operation Cyclone, a programme funded by the United States. Major protests against the Soviet presence broke out in Kabul in 1980 in what is called the 3 Hut uprising.\n\nThe Soviets turned the city of Kabul into their command center during the Soviet-Afghan War. Kabul was considered moderately safe during that period as it was essentially a guerrilla war with fighting mostly taking place in the countryside. During this time, women made up 40% of the workforce. However political crime such as assassinations of PDPA party members or guerrilla attacks on military and government targets were quite common. The Soviet Embassy, for example, was attacked four times with arms fire in the first five years of the war. In 1983, a report from Izvestia said that most public places such as hospitals and state banks had \"people with guns in their hands\", which was not the case before 1979. A Western correspondent revisiting Kabul in December 1983 after a year, said that the city was \"converted into a fortress bristling with weapons\".Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 139 Contrastingly, American diplomat Charles Dunbar said that the Soviet troops' presence was \"surprisingly modest\". He said in a July 1983 article that whilst Soviet troops are a common sight, they \"do not give the impression of invaders who are enforcing their occupation at the point of a bayonet\". Soviet men and women were very common in the city's shopping roads, with the large availability of Western products.Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 139 & 140 An December 1983 article from Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where the author stayed two weeks in the city, said that the Soviet soldiers had a friendly atmosphere in which they would greet friends and have a chat with the population.Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists – December 1983 issue Most Soviet civilians (numbering between 8,000 and 10,000) lived in the north eastern Soviet-style Mikrorayon (microraion) housing complex that was surrounded by barbed-wire and armed tanks. They sometimes received abuse from anti-Soviet civilians on the streets.Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 140 The mujahideen rebels managed to strike at the city a few times - on October 9, 1987, a car bomb planted by a mujahideen group killed 27 people, and on April 27, 1988 in celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Saur Revolution, a truck bomb killed six people.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/27/A-truck-bomb-exploded-in-crowded-downtown-Kabul-today/7671578116800/\n\nThe city's population increased from around 500,000 in 1978 to 1.5 million in 1988.Afghanistan: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan, by Amin Saikal, William Maley – Page 48 The large influx were mostly internal refugees who fled other parts of the country for safety in Kabul.\n\nCivil war and Taliban era\n\nAfter the fall of Najibullah's government in April 1992, leaders of the different mujahideen factions created a new government under the Peshawar Accords, but Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's party refused to sign the accords and started shelling the city for power, which soon escelated into a full-scale conflict. This marked the start of a dark period of the city: at least 30,000 civilians were killed.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/world/guerrillas-take-afghan-capital-as-troops-flee.html About 80 percent of the city was devastated and destroyed by 1996.Bowersox (p.192) The old city and western areas were among the worst-hit. A The New York Times analyst said in 1996 that the city was more devastated than Sarajevo, which was similarly damaged during the Bosnian War at the time.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/world/afghan-capital-grim-as-war-follows-war.html\n\nThe city suffered heavily under a bombardment campaign between rival militias which intensified during the summer of 1992. Its geographic location in a narrow valley made it an easy target from rockets fired by militias who based themselves in the surrounding mountains. Initially the factions in the city aligned to fight off Hekmatyar's forces, but diplomacy inside the capital quickly broke down.Nazif M Shahrani, \"War, Factionalism and the State in Afghanistan\" in American Anthropologist 104:3 (Arlington, Virginia: American Anthropological Association, 2008), 719. For the following two years in particular, much of Kabul would be laid to waste, the majority of infrastructure destroyed, a massive exodus of the population leaving to the countryside or abroad, and electricity and water completely out. In late 1994, bombardment of the capital came to a temporary halt.Amnesty International. \"DOCUMENT – AFGHANISTAN: FURTHER INFORMATION ON FEAR FOR SAFETY AND NEW CONCERN: DELIBERATE AND ARBITRARY KILLINGS: CIVILIANS IN KABUL.\" 16 November 1995 Accessed at:  These forces took steps to restore law and order. Courts started to work again, convicting individuals inside government troops who had committed crimes.\n\nOn September 26, 1996 when the Taliban prepared a major offensive, Ahmad Shah Massoud, the government's military leader, ordered a full retreat from Kabul and fled north.Coll, Ghost Wars (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14. The next day the Taliban seized Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed a strict form of Sharia (Islamic law), restricting women from work and education. They also conducted amputations against common thieves. Their hit-squads from the infamous \"Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice\" watched the streets conducting public beatings of people. During the hardline Taliban regime, Kabul was a deserted city with many residents having long left, most infrastructure destroyed and little to no education or public services\n\n21st century\n\nIn November 2001, the Northern Alliance captured Kabul after the Taliban had abandoned it following the American invasion. A month later a new government under President Hamid Karzai began to assemble. In the meantime, a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Afghanistan. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as many expatriate Afghans returned to the country. The city's population grew from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million in recent years. Many foreign embassies re-opened, and the city has been recovering ever since.\n\nAs of 2014, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have been in charge of security in and around the city. Kabul is periodically the scene of deadly bombings carried out mostly by the Taliban but also by the Haqqani network, ISIL, and other anti-state groups. Government employees, soldiers and ordinary civilians have all been targets of attacks. The Afghan government called the actions of the terrorists war crimes. The deadliest attack yet was a truck bombing in May 2017.\n\nThe city has experienced rapid urbanization with an increasing population. Many informal settlements have been build.http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/system/files/resource-documents/reach_afg_factsheet_kabul_cover_page_jan2017_3.pdf Since the late 2000s, numerous modern housing complexes have been built, many of which are gated and secured, to serve a growing Afghan middle class.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/01/kabul-afghanistan-suburb-modern/ Some of these include the Aria City (in District 10) and Golden City (District 8).https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/to-go-with-story-afghanistan-elections-presidency-economics-news-photo/456453908#to-go-with-story-afghanistanelectionspresidencyeconomics-by-emmanuel-picture-id456453908https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/11/kabul-afghanistan-fifth-fastest-growing-city-world-rapid-urbanisation Some complexes have been built out-of-town, such as the Omid-e-Sabz township (District 13), Qasaba/Khwaja Rawash township (District 15), and Sayed Jamaludin township (District 12).https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2015/03/10/new-township-changes-kabul-ring-road-coursehttp://gholghola.com/en/complete-projects/https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-the-changing-face-of-kabul/27796779.html\n\nA major ambitious $80 billion project called \"Kabul New City\" aims to develop a large modern township of homes and businesses on 1,700 acres of land to the north of Kabul (Districts 18 and 19) and Bagram in Parwan Province.https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2015/03/10/agreement-kabul-new-city-signedhttp://www.dcda.gov.af/ The project was first conceptualized in 2007 and approved in 2009. After years in planning and assistance from the Japanese government, construction started in 2015.https://www.khaama.com/kabul-new-city-to-be-equipped-with-renewal-energy-9614\n\nGeography\n\nKabul is situated in the eastern part of the country, 1791 m above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River. It has been described as a \"bowl surrounded by mountains\".Canada in Afghanistan: The War So Far by Peter Pigott Some of the mountains (which are called koh) include: Khair Khana-e Shamali, Khwaja Rawash, Shakhi Baran Tey, Chihil Sutun, Qurugh, Khwaja Razaq and Sher Darwaza. There are also two mountains in between urban areas in western Kabul: Asmayi (also known as the TV hill) and Ali Abad. Hills within the city (which are called tapa) include Bibi Mahro and Maranjan. Immediately to the south of the old city is the Bala Hissar fortress and the ancient city walls, with mountains behind it.\n\nThe city covers an area size of 1023 km2, making it by far the largest in the country.\n\nClimate\n\nKabul has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) with precipitation concentrated in the winter (almost exclusively falling as snow) and spring months. Temperatures are relatively cool compared to much of Southwest Asia, mainly due to the high elevation of the city. Summer has very low humidity, providing relief from the heat. Autumn features warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are cold, with a January daily average of . Spring is the wettest time of the year, though temperatures are generally amiable. Sunny conditions dominate year-round. The annual mean temperature is , much lower than the other large cities of Afghanistan.\n\nEnvironment\n\nA large lake and wetland is located just to the southeast from the old city called Kol-e Hashmat Khan.https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/kabul-duck-alert-2-pictures-of-birds-and-birdwatchers-at-the-kol-e-hashmat-khan-wetland/ The marsh provides a critical resting place to thousands of birds who fly between the Indian subcontinent and Siberia. In 2017 the government declared the lake a protected area.http://web.unep.org/stories/story/kabul-wetland-declared-new-protected-area-migrating-birds Some rare species of birds have been spotted at the lake, such as the Eastern imperial eagle and the Dalmatian pelican.https://afghanistan.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Kabul.aspx Kabul's other large lake is Qargha, located some 9 km northwest from the center. It is a major attraction for locals as well as foreigners.http://afghanistantimes.af/qargha-lake-a-transcendental-beauty-of-nature/\n\nDemographics\n\nKabul's population was estimated in 2015 at about 4.6 million, which possibly includes the people of the province as well. Another 2015 estimate has put it at 3,678,034. The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars. The lack of an up-to-date census means that there are many various estimates of the population.\n\nKabul's population is estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976.http://www.spvd.cz/index.php/component/content/article/181-clanky/svet/af/217-afghanistan-en This figure rose to about 1.5 million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to a large number of Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid. Although the settlements are illegal, they have been tolerated by authorities. In 2017 Kabul Municipality started a project to paint the homes in these settlements in bright colors in an effort to \"cheer up\" residents.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/world/asia/kabul-urban-sprawl.htmlhttps://www.stripes.com/news/homes-in-kabul-painted-bright-colors-to-cheer-up-war-weary-residents-1.474759\n\nKabul is the most ethnically diverse city in the country, with the population including Afghans from all over the country.Women of Afghanistan in the Post-Taliban Era: How Lives Have Changed and Where They Stand Today by Rosemarie Skaine, 2009. In 2003, the National Geographic Channel reported that Kabul's population was composed of the following ethnic groups: 45% Tajik, 25% Hazara, 25% Pashtun, 2% Uzbek, 1% Baloch, 1% Turkmen, and 1% Afghan Hindu. The Dari (Persian) and Pashto languages are widely used in the region, although Dari serves as the lingua franca. Multilingualism is common throughout the area, particularly among the Pashtun people.\n\nThe term \"Kabuli\" (کابلی) is referred to the heterogeneous urbanites of the city. They are ethnic-neutral, typically speak Dari (Persian), are generally secularly and highly educated, and favor Western fashion. Many Kabulites (especially elites and the upper class) left the country during the civil war and are now outnumbered by rural people who moved in from the countryside, mostly refugees but also labor-seekers.https://my.nps.edu/web/ccs/kabulhttps://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/striking-at-kabul-now-and-then/https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/striking-at-kabul-now-and-then/\n\nAbout 74% of the city's population follow Sunni Islam while 25% are Shiites (mainly the Hazaras). The remaining 1% are followers of Sikhism and Hinduism, as well as one known Christian resident (First Lady Rula Ghani) and one Jewish resident (Zablon Simintov). There are other Christians too but they are from international organizations rather than permanent residents. Kabul also has small Indian and Turkish communities, and in the 1980s had a sizable Russian community.\n\nDistricts\n\nThe city of Kabul is one of the 15 districts of Kabul Province. As the provincial capital, it forms a municipality (shārwāli). It is further divided into 22 city districts or \"Police Districts\" (nāhia). The number of city districts increased from 11 to 18 in 2005, and then to 22 by 2010 after the incorporations of Districts 14 and 19-22 which were annexed by Kabul Municipality from surrounding rural districts. The city limits have thus substantionally increased.\n\nDistrict 1 contains most of the old city. Downtown Kabul mostly consist of Districts 2, 4 and 10.\n\nThe table below show the 22 city districts and their settlements, with information about its land size and usage, accurate as of 2011.http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12068151.pdf\n\nNote that the latter figures don't add up to 100% since there are miscellaneous figures too.\n\nPlaces of interest\n\nEach year about 20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan. Major hotels in Kabul include; the Serena Hotel, the Inter-Continental, and the Safi Landmark Hotel above the Kabul City Center. There are a number of other less-known hotels. Most visitors prefer lodging at guest houses, which are found all over the city. The better and safer ones are in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood where the embassies are located.\n\nThe old part of Kabul is filled with bazaars nestled along its narrow, crooked streets. Cultural sites include: the National Museum of Afghanistan, notably displaying an impressive statue of Surya excavated at Khair Khana, the ruined Darul Aman Palace, the tomb of Mughal Emperor Babur at Bagh-e Babur, and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the Third Afghan War, the tomb of Timur Shah Durrani, the Bagh-e Bala Palace and the imposing Id Gah Mosque (founded 1893). Bala Hissar is a fort destroyed by the British in 1879, in retaliation for the death of their envoy, now restored as a military college. The Minaret of Chakari, destroyed in 1998, had Buddhist swastika and both Mahayana and Theravada qualities.\n\nOther places of interest include Kabul City Center, which is Kabul's first shopping mall, the shops around Flower Street and Chicken Street, Wazir Akbar Khan district, Kabul Golf Club, Kabul Zoo, Abdul Rahman Mosque, Shah-Do Shamshira and other famous mosques, the National Gallery of Afghanistan, the National Archives of Afghanistan, Afghan Royal Family Mausoleum, the OMAR Mine Museum, Bibi Mahro Hill, Kabul Cemetery, and Paghman Gardens. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was also involved in the restoration of the Bagh-e Babur (Babur Gardens).\n\nTappe-i-Maranjan is a nearby hill where Buddhist statues and Graeco-Bactrian coins from the 2nd century BC have been found. Outside the city proper is a citadel and the royal palace. Paghman and Jalalabad are interesting valleys north and east of the city.\n\n*Sports complexes\n**Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground\n**Ghazi Stadium\n**Olympic Committee Gymnasium\n* Parks\n** Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of Babur)\n** Baghi Bala Park\n** Zarnegar Park\n** Shahr-e Naw Park\n** Bagh-e Zanana\n** Chaman-e-Hozori\n** Bibi Mahro Park\n** Lake Qargha\n* Mosques\n** Abdul Rahman Mosque\n** Id Gah Mosque\n** Abu Fazl Mosque in Murad Khane\n** Pul-e Khishti Mosque\n** Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque\n* Mausoleums\n** Mausoleum of Timur Shah Durrani\n** Mausoleum of Abdur Rahman Khan\n** Mausoleum of Zahir Shah and Nadir Shah\n** Mausoleum of Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani\n* Palaces\n**Tajbeg Palace\n**Stor Palace\n**Darul Aman Palace\n**Chihil Sutun Palace\n**Zarnegar Palace\n**Bagh-e Bala Palace\n**Haram Sara Palace\n**Shah Bobo Jan Palace\n**Arg (Presidential Palace), including numerous other palaces inside the compound\n**Delgushah Palace\n* Museums\n** National Museum of Afghanistan\n** National Archives of Afghanistan\n** National Gallery of Afghanistan\n** Negaristani Milli\n* Hotels\n** Serena Hotel\n** Inter-Continental\n** Safi Landmark Hotel\n\nFile:Kabul 2015.jpg|Looking towards a neighborhood from the hill in Wazir Akbar Khan\nFile:Bagh e Bala - panoramio.jpg|Aerial view towards the Bagh-e Bala Palace and the gardens surrounding it\nFile:Garden of Babur By Dani.jpg|View from the Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of Babur)\nFile:Kabul Baghe Babur mosque.jpg|16th-century mosque inside the Gardens of Babur\nFile:Taq-e-Zafar+ cropped.jpg|The Paghman arc de triomphe\nFile:Bird Market Kabul.jpg|The Kabul Bird Market (Ka Foroshi)\nFile:Shah-e-Doshamshera Mosque - panoramio.jpg|Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nThe municipality's administrative structure consists of 17 departments under a mayor. Like other provincial municipalities in Afghanistan, the municipality of Kabul deals with city affairs such as construction and infrastructure. The city districts (nāhia) collect certain taxes and issue building licenses. Each city district has a district head appointed by the mayor, and leads six major departments in the district office. The neighborhood organization structure at the nahia level is called a gozar. A wakil-e gozar is a person chosen to represent a community within a city district.\n\nThe current mayor of Kabul Municipality is Abdullah Habibzai who was appointed in May 2016 as the acting mayor.\n\nKabul's Chief of Police is Lt. Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahimi. The police are part of the Afghan National Police (ANP) under the Ministry of Interior and are arranged by city districts. The Police Chief is selected by the Interior Minister and is responsible for all law enforcement activities throughout the Kabul province.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\n\nKabul's main products include fresh and dried fruit, nuts, beverages, Afghan rugs, leather and sheep skin products, furniture, antique replicas, and domestic clothes. The world bank authorized US$25 million for the Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project which closed in 2011. Over the last decade, the United States has invested approximately $9.1 billion into urban infrastructure in Afghanistan. The wars since 1978 have limited the city's economic productivity but after the establishment of the Karzai administration since late 2001, local economic developments have included a number of indoor shopping malls. The first of these was the Kabul City Center, opened 2005. Others have also opened in recent years including Gulbahar Center, City Walk Mall and Majid Mall.http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20130202/LIFE/302020305https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/03/the-modern-face-of-kabul/100707/\n\nAbout 4 mi from downtown Kabul, in Bagrami, a 22 acre industrial complex has completed with modern facilities, which will allow companies to operate businesses there. The park has professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons.Afghanistan Industrial Parks Development Authority...[http://www.aisa.org.af/IPD/Bagrami.htm Kabul (Bagrami)]  A number of factories operate there, including the $25 million Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Omaid Bahar juice factory.\n\nAccording to Transparency International, the government of Afghanistan is the third most-corrupt in the world. Experts believe that the poor decisions of Afghan politicians contribute to the unrest in the region. This also prevents foreign investment in Afghanistan, especially by Western countries. In 2012, there were reportedly $3.9 billion paid to public officials in bribes which contributed to these issues.\n\nDa Afghanistan Bank, the nation's central bank, is headquartered in Kabul. In addition, there are several commercial banks in the city.Licensed banks in Kabul include: Afghanistan International Bank, Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank, Pashtany Bank, [http://www.afghanunitedbank.com/ Afghan United Bank], Standard Chartered Bank, Punjab National Bank, Habib Bank and Western Union\n\nDevelopment planning\n\nA $1 billion USD contract was signed in 2013 to commence work on the \"New Kabul City\", which is a major residential scheme that would accommodate 1.5 million people. In the meantime, many high rise buildings are being constructed in order to control the overcrowding and also to modernize the city.\n\nAn initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr. Hisham N. Ashkouri, for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul, along the southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,Kabul – City of Light Project...[http://www.cityoflight-kabul.com/p11.htm link] \n\nCommunications\n\nAs of November 2015, there are more than 24 television stations based out of Kabul.\n\nIn Kabul, Minister Amir Zai Sangin of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology maintains statistics regarding telecommunications in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Afghanistan Information Management Services (AIMS) provides software development, capacity development, information management, and project management services to the Afghan Government and other NGOs, thereby supporting their on-the-ground activities.\n\nGSM/GPRS mobile phone services in the city are provided by Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, Roshan, MTN and Salaam. , all of them provide 3G services as well. In November 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a $64.5 million US dollar deal with ZTE on the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network to help improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kabul but throughout the country.Pajhwok Afghan News – [http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2006/11/02/ministry-signs-contract-chinese-company Ministry signs contract with Chinese company] Internet cafes were introduced in 2002 and has been expanding throughout the country. , 3G services are also available.\n\nThere are a number of post offices throughout the city. Package delivery services like FedEx, TNT N.V., and DHL are also available.\n\nTransportation\n\nAir\n\nThe Hamid Karzai International Airport (Kabul International Airport) is located 25 km from the center of Kabul, which has always served as the country's main airport. It is a hub to Ariana Afghan Airlines, the national carrier of Afghanistan, as well as private airlines such as Afghan Jet International, East Horizon Airlines, Kam Air, Pamir Airways, and Safi Airways. Regional airlines such as Air India, SpiceJet, flydubai, Emirates, Gulf Air, Mahan Air, Pakistan International Airlines, Turkish Airlines and others also have regularly scheduled flights to the airport. A new international terminal was built by the government of Japan and began operation in 2008.\n\nRail\n\nKabul has no train service currently, but the government has proposed the building of rail lines or a metro rail in the future. Kabul's only railway service, the Kabul–Darulaman Tramway, operated for only six years from 1923 to 1929. As part of the approved major Deh Sabz \"Kabul New City\" development project that kicked off in 2015, a light rail service is being planned during the mid-term development period.http://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/afghanistan/kabul-new-city-light-rail-plan/\n\nRoad\n\nThe AH76 highway (or Kabul-Charikar Highway) connects Kabul north towards Charikar, Pol-e Khomri and Mazar-i-Sharif (310 km away), with leading roads to Kunduz (250 km away). The AH77 highway goes west towards Bamiyan Province (150 km away) and Chaghcharan in the central mountains of Afghanistan. To the south-west, the Kabul-Ghazni Highway goes to Ghazni (130 km away) and Kandahar (460 km away). To the south, the Kabul-Gardez Highway connects it to Gardez (100 km away) and Khost. To the east, the Kabul-Jalalabad Highway goes to Jalalabad (120 km away) and across the border to Peshawar.\n\nThe steep population rise in the 21st century has caused major congestion problems for the city's roads.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-20509559/traffic-chaos-as-kabul-s-roads-are-improved In efforts to tackle this issue, a 95 km outer ring road costing $110 million was approved in 2017.http://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/officials-say-kabul-ring-road-construction-start-soonrta.org.af/eng/2017/09/17/idb-pays-74m-loan-for-construction-of-kabul-city-ring-road/ Construction will take five years and it will run from Char Asiab via Ahmad Shah Baba Mina, Deh Sabz (\"Kabul New City\" development area), the AH76 highway, Paghman and back to Char Asyab.https://www.khaama.com/president-ghani-kabuls-ring-road-important-economical-project-3768 A new bus public transport service is also planned to be opened in 2018 (see below).http://kbr.id/english/07-2017/amid_chaos__kabul_gears_up_for_pioneering_metro_bus_service/91148.html In September 2017, the head of the Kabul Municipality announced that 286 meters of pedestrian overpass footbridges will be built in eight busy areas \"in the near future\".http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/09/17/building-fly-overs-in-kabul/\n\nUnder the Kabul Urban Transport Efficiency Improvement Project that was signed in 2014 and backed by the World Bank, the city has seen widespread improvements in road conditions, including the building of new pedestrian sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting and asphalted road surfaces. The project runs until December 31, 2019.http://projects.worldbank.org/P131864?lang=enhttps://nl4worldbank.org/2017/06/09/urban-transport-program-helps-keep-kabul-clean/\n\nPrivate vehicles have been on the rise in Kabul since 2002, with about 700,000 cars registered as of 2013 and up to 80% of the cars reported to be Toyota Corollas.http://www.autonews.com/article/20130626/BLOG06/130629915/why-the-corolla-is-so-popular----even-in-afghanistanAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/09/2565599.htm Dodgy cars clogging Kabul's roads] The number of dealerships have also increased from 77 in 2003 to over 550 by 2010.https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/afghanistan/corolla-s-the-car-of-choice-in-kabul-1.112845 Gas stations are mainly private-owned. Bicycles on the road are a common sight in the city.\n\nTaxis\n\nThe taxicabs in Kabul are painted in a white and yellow livery. The majority of these are older model Corollas. A few Soviet-era Russian cabs are also still in operation.\n\nBuses and trolleybuses\n\nLong distance road journeys are made by private Mercedes-Benz coach buses or various types of vans, trucks and cars. Although a nationwide bus service is available from Kabul, flying is safer, especially for foreigners. The city's public bus service (Millie Bus / \"National Bus\") was established in the 1960s to take commuters on daily routes to many destinations. The service currently has about 800 buses. The Kabul bus system has recently discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from MTN similar to \"bus wrap\" advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There is also an express bus that runs from downtown to Hamid Karzai International Airport for Safi Airways passengers.\n\nAn electric trolleybus system operated in Kabul from February 1979 to 1992 using Škoda fleet built by a Czechoslovak company (see Trolleybuses in Kabul for more). The trolleybus service was highly popular mainly due to its low price compared to the Millie Bus conventional bus service. The last trolleybus came to a halt in late 1992 due to warfare. The copper overhead wires were subsequently looted and sold to scrap dealers. The steel poles can still be seen in Kabul today.\n\nIn June 2017 Kabul Municipality unveiled plans for a new bus rapid transit (BRT) system (referred to as \"Metro Bus\"), the first major urban public transportation scheme. The initial route of 8 km will run from De Afghanan in central Kabul to Sara-e Shamali Square in the north-west via Baraki Square and Karte Parwan. The second phase would connect De Afghanan westwards to Kote Sangi via Deh Mazang and Karte Char. Work is underway for a 2018 opening. In the next phases the service will expand to about 111 km by 2020, including covering Dashte Barchi in the west, Darulaman in the south, and Karte Naw in the east.https://www.khaama.com/kabul-municipality-unveils-new-developments-in-metro-bus-project-03420http://www.tolonews.com/business/kabul-municipality-unveils-first-metro-bus-systemhttp://www.1tvnews.af/en/news/afghanistan/29784-kabul-metro-bus-project-to-be-launched-today\n\nEducation\n\nThe Ministry of Education led by Ghulam Farooq Wardak is responsible for the education system in Afghanistan. Public and private schools in the city have reopened since 2002 after they were shut down or destroyed during fighting in the 1980s to the late 1990s. Boys and girls are strongly encouraged to attend school under the Karzai administration but many more schools are needed not only in Kabul but throughout the country. The Afghan Ministry of Education has plans to build more schools in the coming years so that education is provided to all citizens of the country. The most well known high schools in Kabul include:\n* Habibia High School, a British-Afghan school founded in 1903 by King Habibullah Khan\n* Lycée Esteqlal, a Franco-Afghan school founded in 1922\n* Malalai High School, a Franco-Afghan school for girls\n* Amani High School, a German-Afghan school for boys founded in 1924\n* Aisha-i-Durani School, a German-Afghan school for girls\n* Rahman Baba High School, an American-Afghan school for boys\n* International School of Kabul, an American-Afghan school\n* Afghan Turk High Schools, Turkish-Afghan schools\n* Ghulam Haider Khan High School, a school for boys\n* Abdul Hadi Dawi High School, a school for boys\n* Nazo Ana High School, a school for girls\n\nUniversities\n\nThe city's colleges and universities were renovated after 2002. Some of them have been developed recently, while others have existed since the early 20th century.\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care in Afghanistan is relatively poor. The wealthy Afghans usually go abroad when seeking treatment. Presently, there are several hospitals in Kabul which include;\n\n* French Medical Institute for Children\n* Kabul City Hospital\n* Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital\n* Jamhuriat Hospital\n* Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan Hospital\n* Jinnah Hospital (under construction)\n* Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital\n* Malalai Maternity Hospital\n* Rabia-I-Balki Maternity Hospital\n* Maywand Hospital\n* Afshar Hospital\n* Noor Eye Hospital\n* Atatürk Children's Hospital\n* American Medical Center Afghanistan\n* DK-German Medical Diagnostic Center\n* CURE International Hospital\n* KIA ISAF Role 3 Hospital\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\n*  Ankara, Turkey (since 2003)\n* Delhi, India (proposed, 2017)https://thediplomat.com/2015/09/india-and-afghanistan-a-growing-partnership/\n*  Istanbul, Turkey (since 1992)\n*  Kazan, Russia (since 2005)Cultures and Globalization: Cities, Cultural Policy and Governance by Helmut K Anheier, p.376\n* Omaha, Nebraska, United States (since 2003)https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/cities-afghanistan-and-nebraska-forge-sister-cities-partnership",

    "aggregatedText" : "Kabul (;) is the capital of Afghanistan as well as its largest city, located in the eastern section of the country. According to estimates in 2015, the population of Kabul is 4.635 million, which includes all the major ethnic groups. Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world's 64th largest city.\n\nKabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains, with an elevation of 1790 m making it one of the highest capitals in the world. The city is said to be over 3,500 years old, mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. It is at a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia, and a key location of the ancient Silk Road. It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids, Mauryans, Kushans, Kabul Shahis, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khwarazmians, Qarlughids, Khaljis, Timurids, Mughals, and Hotaks, until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire (also known as the \"Afghan Empire\") in 1747. Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776, during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani, the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the British occupied the city but after establishing foreign relations they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan. The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed. A civil war in the 1990s between various rebel groups destroyed much of the city, resulting in many casualties. \n\nKabul is known for its historical gardens, quaint bazaars, and vast amount of palaces.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reversing-kabuls-environmental-setbacks-sayed-aziz-azimihttp://afghanistantimes.af/kabul-city-isnt-just-capital-of-afghanistan-but-of-palaces-as-well/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-capital/once-called-paradise-now-kabul-struggles-to-cope-idUSSP20888220070416 It was also formerly a mecca for young western hippies.Dateline Mongolia: An American Journalist in Nomad's Land by Michael Kohnhttps://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20160830_OTS0058/mein-kabul-orf-reporterlegende-fritz-orter-praesentiert-im-weltjournal-seine-stadt-am-31-august-um-2230-uhr-in-orf-2 Since the removal of the Taliban from power in late 2001, the city gradually began rebuilding itself with assistance from the international community. Despite the many terrorist attacks by anti-state elements, the city is greatly developing and was the fifth fastest-growing city in the world as of 2012. The city is divided into 22 districts.\n\nToponymy\n\nKabul (;  ',;  ',),See [http://www.nationalreview.com/nordlinger/nordlinger112002.asp National Review, November 20, 2002], [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kabul Merriam-Webster: Kabul] also spelled Cabool, Caubul, Kabol, or Cabul.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\n \nThe actual origin of Kabul, who built it and when, is unknown. In the Hindu book Rigveda, composed between 1700–1100 BCE, one of the four canonical sacred texts (śruti) of Hinduism, and the Avesta, the primary collection of sacred texts of Zoroastrianism; in these sources, Kabul is referred to as Kubha.Adamec, p.231 The book calls it an \"ideal city\" and is full of poems in praise of the city. The area in which the city sits was ruled by Medes though much information is not available about it.  refers to the Kabul River. The Rigveda praises it as an ideal city, a vision of paradise set in the mountains. The area in which the Kabul valley sits was ruled by the Medes before falling to the Achaemenids.\n\nIn the 6th century BCE, the city fell to the Achaemenid Empire. During that period, Kabul became a center of learning for Zoroastrianism which was followed by Buddhism and Hinduism. There is a reference to a settlement called Kabura by the rulers of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nWhen Alexander annexed the Achaemenid Empire, the Kabul region came under his control. After his death, his empire was seized by his general Seleucus, becoming part of the Seleucid Empire. In 305 BCE, he extended his empire all the way to the Indus river, which caused a friction with the neighboring Mauryan Empire. It is widely believed that the two empires reached an alliance treaty. During the Mauryan period, trade flourished because of uniform weights and measures. Irrigation facilities for public use were developed leading to an increased harvest of crops. People were also employed as artisans, jewelers, carpenters.Romano, p.12\n\nThe Greco-Bactrians took control of Kabul from the Mauryans in the early 2nd century BC, then lost the city to their subordinates in the Indo-Greek Kingdom around the mid-2nd century BC. Buddhism was greatly patronized by the rulers and majority of people of the city were adherents of the religion. Indo-Scythians expelled the Indo-Greeks by the mid 1st century BC, but lost the city to the Kushan Empire about 100 years later.\n\nSome historians ascribe Kabul the Sanskrit name of Kamboja (Kamboj). It is mentioned as Kophes or Kophene in some classical writings. Hsuan Tsang refers to the name as Kaofu in the 7th century AD, which is the appellation of one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi who had migrated from across the Hindu Kush into the Kabul valley around the beginning of the Christian era. It was conquered by Kushan Emperor Kujula Kadphises in about 45 AD and remained Kushan territory until at least the 3rd century AD.Hill, John E. 2004. The Peoples of the West from the Weilue 魏略 by Yu Huan 魚豢: A Third Century Chinese Account Composed between 239 and 265 AD. Draft annotated English translation... [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/weilue.html Link]Hill (2004), pp. 29, 352–352. The Kushans were Indo-European-speaking Tocharians from the Tarim Basin.A. D. H. Bivar, [http://iranicaonline.org/articles/kushan-dynasty-i-history KUSHAN DYNASTY], in Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2010\n\nAround 230 AD, the Kushans were defeated by the Sassanid Empire and replaced by Sassanid vassals known as the Indo-Sassanids. During the Sassanian period, the city was referred to as \"Kapul\" in Pahlavi scripts. In 420 AD the Indo-Sassanids were driven out of Afghanistan by the Xionite tribe known as the Kidarites, who were then replaced in the 460s by the Hephthalites. It became part of the surviving Turk Shahi Kingdom of Kapisa, also known as Kabul-Shahan. According to Táríkhu-l Hind by Al-Biruni, Kabul was governed by princes of Turkic lineage whose rule lasted for about 60 generations.\n\nThe Kabul rulers built a long defensive wall around the city to protect it from enemy raids. This historical wall has survived until today. It was briefly held by Tibetan Empire between 801 and 815.\n\nIslamization and Mongol invasion\n\n \nThe Islamic conquest reached modern-day Afghanistan in 642 AD, at a time when Kabul was independent. A number of failed expeditions were made to Islamize the region. In one of them, Abdur Rahman bin Samana arrived to Kabul from Zaranj in the late 600s and managed to convert 12,000 local inhabitants to Islam before abandoning the city. Muslims were a minority until Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar of Zaranj conquered Kabul in 870 and established the first Islamic dynasty in the region. It was reported that the rulers of Kabul were Muslims with non-Muslims living close by.\n\nOver the following centuries, the city was successively controlled by the Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khwarazmshahs, Qarlughids, and Khaljis. In the 13th century, the invading Mongols caused major destruction in the region. Report of a massacre in the close by Bamiyan is recorded around this period, where the entire population of the valley was annihilated by the Mongol troops as a revenge for the death of Genghis Khan's grandson. As a result, many natives of Afghanistan fled south toward the Indian subcontinent where some established dynasties in Delhi. The Chagatai Khanate and Kartids were vassals of Ilkhanate till dissolution of latter in 1335.\n\nFollowing the era of the Khalji dynasty in 1333, the famous Moroccan scholar Ibn Battuta was visiting Kabul and wrote:\n\nTimurid and Mughal era\n\nIn the 14th century, Kabul became a major trading center under the kingdom of Timur (Tamerlane). In 1504, the city fell to Babur from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later Mughal Empire. In 1525, Babur described Kabulistan in his memoirs by writing that:\n\nMirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, a poet from Hindustan who visited at the time wrote: \"Dine and drink in Kabul: it is mountain, desert, city, river and all else.\" It was from here that Babur began his 1526 conquest of Hindustan, which was ruled by the Afghan Lodi dynasty and began east of the Indus River in what is present-day Pakistan. Babur loved Kabul due to the fact that he lived in it for 20 years and the people were loyal to him, including its weather that he was used to. His wish to be buried in Kabul was finally granted. The inscription on his tomb contains the famous Persian couplet, which states: اگرفردوس روی زمین است همین است و همین است و همین است (If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!)\n\nDurrani Empire\n\nNine years after Nader Shah and his forces invaded and occupied the city as part of the more easternmost parts of his Empire, he was assassinated by his own officers, causing the rapid disintegration of it. Ahmad Shah Durrani, commander of 4,000 Abdali Afghans, asserted Pashtun rule in 1747 and further expanded his new Afghan Empire. His ascension to power marked the beginning of Afghanistan. His son Timur Shah Durrani, after inheriting power, transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776, and used Peshawar in what is today Pakistan as the winter capital. Timur Shah died in 1793 and was succeeded by his son Zaman Shah Durrani. Kabul's first visitor from Europe was Englishman George Forster, who described 18th-century Kabul as \"the best and cleanest city in South Asia\".\n\nIn 1826, the kingdom was claimed by Dost Mohammad Khan but in 1839 Shujah Shah Durrani was re-installed with the help of British India during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In 1841 a local uprising resulted in the killing of the British resident and loss of mission in Kabul and the 1842 retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad. In 1842 the British returned to Kabul, plundering Bala Hissar in revenge before fleeing back to British India (now Pakistan). Akbar Khan took to the throne from 1842 to 1845 and was followed by Dost Mohammad Khan.\n\nThe British-led Indian forces invaded in 1879 when Kabul was under Sher Ali Khan's rule, as the Afghan king initially refused to accept British diplomatic mission and later the British residents were again massacred. The British partially destroyed Bala Hissar fortress before retreating to British India.\n\n20th century\n\nHaving become an established bazaar city, leather and textile industries developed by 1916.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf\n\nIn the early 20th century King Amanullah Khan rose to power. His reforms included electricity for the city and schooling for girls. He drove a Rolls-Royce, and lived in the famous Darul Aman Palace. In 1919, after the Third Anglo-Afghan War, Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from foreign affairs at Eidgah Mosque. In 1929 King Ammanullah left Kabul due to a local uprising orchestrated by Habibullah Kalakani. After nine months rule, Kalakani was imprisoned and executed by King Nader Khan. Three years later, in 1933, the new king was assassinated by a Hazara student Abdul Khaliq during an award ceremony inside a school in Kabul. The throne was left to his 19-year-old son, Zahir Shah, who became the last King of Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the inter-war period France and Germany worked to help develop the country and maintained high schools and lycees in the capital, providing education for the children of the city's elite families.Anthony Hyman, \"Nationalism in Afghanistan\" in International Journal of Middle East Studies, 34:2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 305. Kabul University opened in 1932 and by the 1960s western educated Afghans made up the majority of teachers.Hyman, 305. By the 1960s the majority of instructors at the university had degrees from Western universities.\n\nWhen Zahir Shah took power in 1933 Kabul had the only 6 mi of rail in the country and the country had few internal telegraphs, phone lines or roads. Zahir turned to the Japanese, Germans and Italians for help developing a modern transportation and communication network.Nick Cullather, \"Damming Afghanistan: Modernization in a Buffer State\" in The Journal of American History 89:2 (Indiana: Organization of American Historians, 2002) 518. A radio tower built by the Germans in 1937 in Kabul allowing instant communication with outlying villages.Cullather, 518. A national bank and state cartels were organized to allow for economic modernization.Cullather, 519. Textile mills, power plants, carpet and furniture factories were also built in Kabul, providing much needed manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, urbanization accelerated and the built-up area was increased to 68 km² by 1962, an almost fourteen-fold increase compared to 1925.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf\n\nIn 1955, the Soviet Union forwarded $100 million in credit to Afghanistan, which financed public transportation, airports, a cement factory, mechanized bakery, a five-lane highway from Kabul to the Soviet border and dams.Cullather, 530.\n\nIn the 1960s the first Marks & Spencer store in Central Asia was built in the city. Kabul Zoo was inaugurated in 1967, which was maintained with the help of visiting German zoologists. Many foreigners began flocking to Kabul and the nation's tourism industry was starting to pick up speed. Kabul experimented with liberalization, dropping laws requiring women to wear burkas, restrictions on speech and assembly were loosened which led to student politics in the capital.Cullather, 534. Socialist, Maoist and liberal factions demonstrated daily in Kabul while more traditional Islamic leaders spoke out against the failure to aid the Afghan countryside. From the 1960s until the late 1970s, Kabul was a major stop on the famous Hippie trail.\n\nIn 1969 a religious uprising at the Pul-e Khishti Mosque protested the Soviet Union's increasing influence over Afghan politics and religion. This protest ended in the arrest of many of its organizers, including Mawlana Faizani, a popular Islamic scholar. In the early 1970s Radio Kabul began to broadcast in other languages besides Pashto which helped to unify those minorities that often felt marginalized. However this was put to a stop after Daoud Khan, the King's cousin and former Prime Minister, launched a coup in July 1973Hyman, \"Nationalism in Afghanistan\", 307. which deposed the King and took over power. This was supported by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a pro-Soviet political party. Daoud named himself President and planned to institute reforms.John E. Haynes, \"Keeping Cool About Kabul\" in World Affairs, 145:4 (Washington, D.C.: Heldref Publications, 1983), 371. The BBC has described the period before the April 1978 Revolution as an era when different ethnic groups of Afghanistan lived together harmoniously, intermarried and mixed socially.\n\nBy 1975, the young Ahmad Shah Massoud and his followers initiated an uprising in Panjshir but were forced to flee to neighboring Pakistan where they received recruitment from Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to create unrest in Afghanistan with the help of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). It is claimed that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 Saur Revolution in Kabul by making Daoud spread his armed forces to the countryside. \"To launch this plan, Bhutto recruited and trained a group of Afghans in the Bala-Hesar of Peshawar, in Pakistan's North-west Frontier Province. Among these young men were Massoud, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and other members of Jawanan-e Musulman. Massoud's mission to Bhutto was to create unrest in northern Afghanistan. It served Massoud's interests, which were apparently opposition to the Soviets and independence for Afghanistan. Later, after Massoud and Hekmatyar had a terrible falling-out over Massoud's opposition to terrorist tactics and methods, Massoud overthrew from Jawanan-e Musulman. He joined Rabani's newly created Afghan political party, Jamiat-i-Islami, in exile in Pakistan.\"\n\nSoviet occupation\n\nOn April 28, 1978, President Daoud and most of his family were assassinated in Kabul, in what is called the Saur Revolution. Pro-Soviet PDPA under Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and slowly began to institute reforms.Haynes, 372. Private businesses were nationalized in the Soviet manner.Haynes, 373. Education was modified into the Soviet model, with lessons focusing on teaching Russian, Marxism-Leninism and learning of other countries belonging to the Soviet bloc. Foreign-backed rebel groups and army deserters took up arms in the name of Islam.\n\nIn February 1979, U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs was murdered after Afghan security forces burst in on his kidnappers. In neighboring Pakistan, President Zulfiqar Bhutto was executed in April 1979. In September 1979 Afghan President Taraki was assassinated by his rival Hafizullah Amin, who in turn was assassinated in December 1979 by a team of Soviet Spetsnaz inside the Tajbeg Palace in Kabul. On December 24, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and Kabul was heavily occupied by Soviet Armed Forces. Following this invasion, Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq chaired a meeting in Islamabad and was told by several cabinet members to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan, owing to the vastly superior military power of the Soviet Union. However, Zia-ul-Haq, fearing that the Soviets may be advancing into Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, made no secret about his intentions of aiding the mujahideen rebel groups. During this meeting, Director-General of the ISI Akhtar Abdur Rahman advocated for the idea of covert operation in Afghanistan by arming the Islamic extremists. General Rahman was heard loudly saying: \"Kabul must burn! Kabul must burn!\", and mastered the idea of proxy war in Afghanistan. President Zia-ul-Haq authorised this operation under General Rahman, and it was later merged with Operation Cyclone, a programme funded by the United States. Major protests against the Soviet presence broke out in Kabul in 1980 in what is called the 3 Hut uprising.\n\nThe Soviets turned the city of Kabul into their command center during the Soviet-Afghan War. Kabul was considered moderately safe during that period as it was essentially a guerrilla war with fighting mostly taking place in the countryside. During this time, women made up 40% of the workforce. However political crime such as assassinations of PDPA party members or guerrilla attacks on military and government targets were quite common. The Soviet Embassy, for example, was attacked four times with arms fire in the first five years of the war. In 1983, a report from Izvestia said that most public places such as hospitals and state banks had \"people with guns in their hands\", which was not the case before 1979. A Western correspondent revisiting Kabul in December 1983 after a year, said that the city was \"converted into a fortress bristling with weapons\".Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 139 Contrastingly, American diplomat Charles Dunbar said that the Soviet troops' presence was \"surprisingly modest\". He said in a July 1983 article that whilst Soviet troops are a common sight, they \"do not give the impression of invaders who are enforcing their occupation at the point of a bayonet\". Soviet men and women were very common in the city's shopping roads, with the large availability of Western products.Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 139 & 140 An December 1983 article from Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where the author stayed two weeks in the city, said that the Soviet soldiers had a friendly atmosphere in which they would greet friends and have a chat with the population.Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists – December 1983 issue Most Soviet civilians (numbering between 8,000 and 10,000) lived in the north eastern Soviet-style Mikrorayon (microraion) housing complex that was surrounded by barbed-wire and armed tanks. They sometimes received abuse from anti-Soviet civilians on the streets.Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation, By J. Bruce Amstutz – Page 140 The mujahideen rebels managed to strike at the city a few times - on October 9, 1987, a car bomb planted by a mujahideen group killed 27 people, and on April 27, 1988 in celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Saur Revolution, a truck bomb killed six people.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/27/A-truck-bomb-exploded-in-crowded-downtown-Kabul-today/7671578116800/\n\nThe city's population increased from around 500,000 in 1978 to 1.5 million in 1988.Afghanistan: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan, by Amin Saikal, William Maley – Page 48 The large influx were mostly internal refugees who fled other parts of the country for safety in Kabul.\n\nCivil war and Taliban era\n\nAfter the fall of Najibullah's government in April 1992, leaders of the different mujahideen factions created a new government under the Peshawar Accords, but Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's party refused to sign the accords and started shelling the city for power, which soon escelated into a full-scale conflict. This marked the start of a dark period of the city: at least 30,000 civilians were killed.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/world/guerrillas-take-afghan-capital-as-troops-flee.html About 80 percent of the city was devastated and destroyed by 1996.Bowersox (p.192) The old city and western areas were among the worst-hit. A The New York Times analyst said in 1996 that the city was more devastated than Sarajevo, which was similarly damaged during the Bosnian War at the time.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/world/afghan-capital-grim-as-war-follows-war.html\n\nThe city suffered heavily under a bombardment campaign between rival militias which intensified during the summer of 1992. Its geographic location in a narrow valley made it an easy target from rockets fired by militias who based themselves in the surrounding mountains. Initially the factions in the city aligned to fight off Hekmatyar's forces, but diplomacy inside the capital quickly broke down.Nazif M Shahrani, \"War, Factionalism and the State in Afghanistan\" in American Anthropologist 104:3 (Arlington, Virginia: American Anthropological Association, 2008), 719. For the following two years in particular, much of Kabul would be laid to waste, the majority of infrastructure destroyed, a massive exodus of the population leaving to the countryside or abroad, and electricity and water completely out. In late 1994, bombardment of the capital came to a temporary halt.Amnesty International. \"DOCUMENT – AFGHANISTAN: FURTHER INFORMATION ON FEAR FOR SAFETY AND NEW CONCERN: DELIBERATE AND ARBITRARY KILLINGS: CIVILIANS IN KABUL.\" 16 November 1995 Accessed at:  These forces took steps to restore law and order. Courts started to work again, convicting individuals inside government troops who had committed crimes.\n\nOn September 26, 1996 when the Taliban prepared a major offensive, Ahmad Shah Massoud, the government's military leader, ordered a full retreat from Kabul and fled north.Coll, Ghost Wars (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14. The next day the Taliban seized Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed a strict form of Sharia (Islamic law), restricting women from work and education. They also conducted amputations against common thieves. Their hit-squads from the infamous \"Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice\" watched the streets conducting public beatings of people. During the hardline Taliban regime, Kabul was a deserted city with many residents having long left, most infrastructure destroyed and little to no education or public services\n\n21st century\n\nIn November 2001, the Northern Alliance captured Kabul after the Taliban had abandoned it following the American invasion. A month later a new government under President Hamid Karzai began to assemble. In the meantime, a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Afghanistan. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as many expatriate Afghans returned to the country. The city's population grew from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million in recent years. Many foreign embassies re-opened, and the city has been recovering ever since.\n\nAs of 2014, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have been in charge of security in and around the city. Kabul is periodically the scene of deadly bombings carried out mostly by the Taliban but also by the Haqqani network, ISIL, and other anti-state groups. Government employees, soldiers and ordinary civilians have all been targets of attacks. The Afghan government called the actions of the terrorists war crimes. The deadliest attack yet was a truck bombing in May 2017.\n\nThe city has experienced rapid urbanization with an increasing population. Many informal settlements have been build.http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/system/files/resource-documents/reach_afg_factsheet_kabul_cover_page_jan2017_3.pdf Since the late 2000s, numerous modern housing complexes have been built, many of which are gated and secured, to serve a growing Afghan middle class.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/01/kabul-afghanistan-suburb-modern/ Some of these include the Aria City (in District 10) and Golden City (District 8).https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/to-go-with-story-afghanistan-elections-presidency-economics-news-photo/456453908#to-go-with-story-afghanistanelectionspresidencyeconomics-by-emmanuel-picture-id456453908https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/11/kabul-afghanistan-fifth-fastest-growing-city-world-rapid-urbanisation Some complexes have been built out-of-town, such as the Omid-e-Sabz township (District 13), Qasaba/Khwaja Rawash township (District 15), and Sayed Jamaludin township (District 12).https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2015/03/10/new-township-changes-kabul-ring-road-coursehttp://gholghola.com/en/complete-projects/https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-the-changing-face-of-kabul/27796779.html\n\nA major ambitious $80 billion project called \"Kabul New City\" aims to develop a large modern township of homes and businesses on 1,700 acres of land to the north of Kabul (Districts 18 and 19) and Bagram in Parwan Province.https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2015/03/10/agreement-kabul-new-city-signedhttp://www.dcda.gov.af/ The project was first conceptualized in 2007 and approved in 2009. After years in planning and assistance from the Japanese government, construction started in 2015.https://www.khaama.com/kabul-new-city-to-be-equipped-with-renewal-energy-9614\n\nGeography\n\nKabul is situated in the eastern part of the country, 1791 m above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River. It has been described as a \"bowl surrounded by mountains\".Canada in Afghanistan: The War So Far by Peter Pigott Some of the mountains (which are called koh) include: Khair Khana-e Shamali, Khwaja Rawash, Shakhi Baran Tey, Chihil Sutun, Qurugh, Khwaja Razaq and Sher Darwaza. There are also two mountains in between urban areas in western Kabul: Asmayi (also known as the TV hill) and Ali Abad. Hills within the city (which are called tapa) include Bibi Mahro and Maranjan. Immediately to the south of the old city is the Bala Hissar fortress and the ancient city walls, with mountains behind it.\n\nThe city covers an area size of 1023 km2, making it by far the largest in the country.\n\nClimate\n\nKabul has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) with precipitation concentrated in the winter (almost exclusively falling as snow) and spring months. Temperatures are relatively cool compared to much of Southwest Asia, mainly due to the high elevation of the city. Summer has very low humidity, providing relief from the heat. Autumn features warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are cold, with a January daily average of . Spring is the wettest time of the year, though temperatures are generally amiable. Sunny conditions dominate year-round. The annual mean temperature is , much lower than the other large cities of Afghanistan.\n\nEnvironment\n\nA large lake and wetland is located just to the southeast from the old city called Kol-e Hashmat Khan.https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/kabul-duck-alert-2-pictures-of-birds-and-birdwatchers-at-the-kol-e-hashmat-khan-wetland/ The marsh provides a critical resting place to thousands of birds who fly between the Indian subcontinent and Siberia. In 2017 the government declared the lake a protected area.http://web.unep.org/stories/story/kabul-wetland-declared-new-protected-area-migrating-birds Some rare species of birds have been spotted at the lake, such as the Eastern imperial eagle and the Dalmatian pelican.https://afghanistan.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Kabul.aspx Kabul's other large lake is Qargha, located some 9 km northwest from the center. It is a major attraction for locals as well as foreigners.http://afghanistantimes.af/qargha-lake-a-transcendental-beauty-of-nature/\n\nDemographics\n\nKabul's population was estimated in 2015 at about 4.6 million, which possibly includes the people of the province as well. Another 2015 estimate has put it at 3,678,034. The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars. The lack of an up-to-date census means that there are many various estimates of the population.\n\nKabul's population is estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMMJ.pdf More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976.http://www.spvd.cz/index.php/component/content/article/181-clanky/svet/af/217-afghanistan-en This figure rose to about 1.5 million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to a large number of Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid. Although the settlements are illegal, they have been tolerated by authorities. In 2017 Kabul Municipality started a project to paint the homes in these settlements in bright colors in an effort to \"cheer up\" residents.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/world/asia/kabul-urban-sprawl.htmlhttps://www.stripes.com/news/homes-in-kabul-painted-bright-colors-to-cheer-up-war-weary-residents-1.474759\n\nKabul is the most ethnically diverse city in the country, with the population including Afghans from all over the country.Women of Afghanistan in the Post-Taliban Era: How Lives Have Changed and Where They Stand Today by Rosemarie Skaine, 2009. In 2003, the National Geographic Channel reported that Kabul's population was composed of the following ethnic groups: 45% Tajik, 25% Hazara, 25% Pashtun, 2% Uzbek, 1% Baloch, 1% Turkmen, and 1% Afghan Hindu. The Dari (Persian) and Pashto languages are widely used in the region, although Dari serves as the lingua franca. Multilingualism is common throughout the area, particularly among the Pashtun people.\n\nThe term \"Kabuli\" (کابلی) is referred to the heterogeneous urbanites of the city. They are ethnic-neutral, typically speak Dari (Persian), are generally secularly and highly educated, and favor Western fashion. Many Kabulites (especially elites and the upper class) left the country during the civil war and are now outnumbered by rural people who moved in from the countryside, mostly refugees but also labor-seekers.https://my.nps.edu/web/ccs/kabulhttps://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/striking-at-kabul-now-and-then/https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/striking-at-kabul-now-and-then/\n\nAbout 74% of the city's population follow Sunni Islam while 25% are Shiites (mainly the Hazaras). The remaining 1% are followers of Sikhism and Hinduism, as well as one known Christian resident (First Lady Rula Ghani) and one Jewish resident (Zablon Simintov). There are other Christians too but they are from international organizations rather than permanent residents. Kabul also has small Indian and Turkish communities, and in the 1980s had a sizable Russian community.\n\nDistricts\n\nThe city of Kabul is one of the 15 districts of Kabul Province. As the provincial capital, it forms a municipality (shārwāli). It is further divided into 22 city districts or \"Police Districts\" (nāhia). The number of city districts increased from 11 to 18 in 2005, and then to 22 by 2010 after the incorporations of Districts 14 and 19-22 which were annexed by Kabul Municipality from surrounding rural districts. The city limits have thus substantionally increased.\n\nDistrict 1 contains most of the old city. Downtown Kabul mostly consist of Districts 2, 4 and 10.\n\nThe table below show the 22 city districts and their settlements, with information about its land size and usage, accurate as of 2011.http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12068151.pdf\n\nNote that the latter figures don't add up to 100% since there are miscellaneous figures too.\n\nPlaces of interest\n\nEach year about 20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan. Major hotels in Kabul include; the Serena Hotel, the Inter-Continental, and the Safi Landmark Hotel above the Kabul City Center. There are a number of other less-known hotels. Most visitors prefer lodging at guest houses, which are found all over the city. The better and safer ones are in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood where the embassies are located.\n\nThe old part of Kabul is filled with bazaars nestled along its narrow, crooked streets. Cultural sites include: the National Museum of Afghanistan, notably displaying an impressive statue of Surya excavated at Khair Khana, the ruined Darul Aman Palace, the tomb of Mughal Emperor Babur at Bagh-e Babur, and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the Third Afghan War, the tomb of Timur Shah Durrani, the Bagh-e Bala Palace and the imposing Id Gah Mosque (founded 1893). Bala Hissar is a fort destroyed by the British in 1879, in retaliation for the death of their envoy, now restored as a military college. The Minaret of Chakari, destroyed in 1998, had Buddhist swastika and both Mahayana and Theravada qualities.\n\nOther places of interest include Kabul City Center, which is Kabul's first shopping mall, the shops around Flower Street and Chicken Street, Wazir Akbar Khan district, Kabul Golf Club, Kabul Zoo, Abdul Rahman Mosque, Shah-Do Shamshira and other famous mosques, the National Gallery of Afghanistan, the National Archives of Afghanistan, Afghan Royal Family Mausoleum, the OMAR Mine Museum, Bibi Mahro Hill, Kabul Cemetery, and Paghman Gardens. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was also involved in the restoration of the Bagh-e Babur (Babur Gardens).\n\nTappe-i-Maranjan is a nearby hill where Buddhist statues and Graeco-Bactrian coins from the 2nd century BC have been found. Outside the city proper is a citadel and the royal palace. Paghman and Jalalabad are interesting valleys north and east of the city.\n\n*Sports complexes\n**Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground\n**Ghazi Stadium\n**Olympic Committee Gymnasium\n* Parks\n** Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of Babur)\n** Baghi Bala Park\n** Zarnegar Park\n** Shahr-e Naw Park\n** Bagh-e Zanana\n** Chaman-e-Hozori\n** Bibi Mahro Park\n** Lake Qargha\n* Mosques\n** Abdul Rahman Mosque\n** Id Gah Mosque\n** Abu Fazl Mosque in Murad Khane\n** Pul-e Khishti Mosque\n** Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque\n* Mausoleums\n** Mausoleum of Timur Shah Durrani\n** Mausoleum of Abdur Rahman Khan\n** Mausoleum of Zahir Shah and Nadir Shah\n** Mausoleum of Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani\n* Palaces\n**Tajbeg Palace\n**Stor Palace\n**Darul Aman Palace\n**Chihil Sutun Palace\n**Zarnegar Palace\n**Bagh-e Bala Palace\n**Haram Sara Palace\n**Shah Bobo Jan Palace\n**Arg (Presidential Palace), including numerous other palaces inside the compound\n**Delgushah Palace\n* Museums\n** National Museum of Afghanistan\n** National Archives of Afghanistan\n** National Gallery of Afghanistan\n** Negaristani Milli\n* Hotels\n** Serena Hotel\n** Inter-Continental\n** Safi Landmark Hotel\n\nFile:Kabul 2015.jpg|Looking towards a neighborhood from the hill in Wazir Akbar Khan\nFile:Bagh e Bala - panoramio.jpg|Aerial view towards the Bagh-e Bala Palace and the gardens surrounding it\nFile:Garden of Babur By Dani.jpg|View from the Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of Babur)\nFile:Kabul Baghe Babur mosque.jpg|16th-century mosque inside the Gardens of Babur\nFile:Taq-e-Zafar+ cropped.jpg|The Paghman arc de triomphe\nFile:Bird Market Kabul.jpg|The Kabul Bird Market (Ka Foroshi)\nFile:Shah-e-Doshamshera Mosque - panoramio.jpg|Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nThe municipality's administrative structure consists of 17 departments under a mayor. Like other provincial municipalities in Afghanistan, the municipality of Kabul deals with city affairs such as construction and infrastructure. The city districts (nāhia) collect certain taxes and issue building licenses. Each city district has a district head appointed by the mayor, and leads six major departments in the district office. The neighborhood organization structure at the nahia level is called a gozar. A wakil-e gozar is a person chosen to represent a community within a city district.\n\nThe current mayor of Kabul Municipality is Abdullah Habibzai who was appointed in May 2016 as the acting mayor.\n\nKabul's Chief of Police is Lt. Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahimi. The police are part of the Afghan National Police (ANP) under the Ministry of Interior and are arranged by city districts. The Police Chief is selected by the Interior Minister and is responsible for all law enforcement activities throughout the Kabul province.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\n\nKabul's main products include fresh and dried fruit, nuts, beverages, Afghan rugs, leather and sheep skin products, furniture, antique replicas, and domestic clothes. The world bank authorized US$25 million for the Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project which closed in 2011. Over the last decade, the United States has invested approximately $9.1 billion into urban infrastructure in Afghanistan. The wars since 1978 have limited the city's economic productivity but after the establishment of the Karzai administration since late 2001, local economic developments have included a number of indoor shopping malls. The first of these was the Kabul City Center, opened 2005. Others have also opened in recent years including Gulbahar Center, City Walk Mall and Majid Mall.http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20130202/LIFE/302020305https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/03/the-modern-face-of-kabul/100707/\n\nAbout 4 mi from downtown Kabul, in Bagrami, a 22 acre industrial complex has completed with modern facilities, which will allow companies to operate businesses there. The park has professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons.Afghanistan Industrial Parks Development Authority...[http://www.aisa.org.af/IPD/Bagrami.htm Kabul (Bagrami)]  A number of factories operate there, including the $25 million Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Omaid Bahar juice factory.\n\nAccording to Transparency International, the government of Afghanistan is the third most-corrupt in the world. Experts believe that the poor decisions of Afghan politicians contribute to the unrest in the region. This also prevents foreign investment in Afghanistan, especially by Western countries. In 2012, there were reportedly $3.9 billion paid to public officials in bribes which contributed to these issues.\n\nDa Afghanistan Bank, the nation's central bank, is headquartered in Kabul. In addition, there are several commercial banks in the city.Licensed banks in Kabul include: Afghanistan International Bank, Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank, Pashtany Bank, [http://www.afghanunitedbank.com/ Afghan United Bank], Standard Chartered Bank, Punjab National Bank, Habib Bank and Western Union\n\nDevelopment planning\n\nA $1 billion USD contract was signed in 2013 to commence work on the \"New Kabul City\", which is a major residential scheme that would accommodate 1.5 million people. In the meantime, many high rise buildings are being constructed in order to control the overcrowding and also to modernize the city.\n\nAn initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr. Hisham N. Ashkouri, for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul, along the southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,Kabul – City of Light Project...[http://www.cityoflight-kabul.com/p11.htm link] \n\nCommunications\n\nAs of November 2015, there are more than 24 television stations based out of Kabul.\n\nIn Kabul, Minister Amir Zai Sangin of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology maintains statistics regarding telecommunications in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Afghanistan Information Management Services (AIMS) provides software development, capacity development, information management, and project management services to the Afghan Government and other NGOs, thereby supporting their on-the-ground activities.\n\nGSM/GPRS mobile phone services in the city are provided by Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, Roshan, MTN and Salaam. , all of them provide 3G services as well. In November 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a $64.5 million US dollar deal with ZTE on the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network to help improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kabul but throughout the country.Pajhwok Afghan News – [http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2006/11/02/ministry-signs-contract-chinese-company Ministry signs contract with Chinese company] Internet cafes were introduced in 2002 and has been expanding throughout the country. , 3G services are also available.\n\nThere are a number of post offices throughout the city. Package delivery services like FedEx, TNT N.V., and DHL are also available.\n\nTransportation\n\nAir\n\nThe Hamid Karzai International Airport (Kabul International Airport) is located 25 km from the center of Kabul, which has always served as the country's main airport. It is a hub to Ariana Afghan Airlines, the national carrier of Afghanistan, as well as private airlines such as Afghan Jet International, East Horizon Airlines, Kam Air, Pamir Airways, and Safi Airways. Regional airlines such as Air India, SpiceJet, flydubai, Emirates, Gulf Air, Mahan Air, Pakistan International Airlines, Turkish Airlines and others also have regularly scheduled flights to the airport. A new international terminal was built by the government of Japan and began operation in 2008.\n\nRail\n\nKabul has no train service currently, but the government has proposed the building of rail lines or a metro rail in the future. Kabul's only railway service, the Kabul–Darulaman Tramway, operated for only six years from 1923 to 1929. As part of the approved major Deh Sabz \"Kabul New City\" development project that kicked off in 2015, a light rail service is being planned during the mid-term development period.http://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/afghanistan/kabul-new-city-light-rail-plan/\n\nRoad\n\nThe AH76 highway (or Kabul-Charikar Highway) connects Kabul north towards Charikar, Pol-e Khomri and Mazar-i-Sharif (310 km away), with leading roads to Kunduz (250 km away). The AH77 highway goes west towards Bamiyan Province (150 km away) and Chaghcharan in the central mountains of Afghanistan. To the south-west, the Kabul-Ghazni Highway goes to Ghazni (130 km away) and Kandahar (460 km away). To the south, the Kabul-Gardez Highway connects it to Gardez (100 km away) and Khost. To the east, the Kabul-Jalalabad Highway goes to Jalalabad (120 km away) and across the border to Peshawar.\n\nThe steep population rise in the 21st century has caused major congestion problems for the city's roads.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-20509559/traffic-chaos-as-kabul-s-roads-are-improved In efforts to tackle this issue, a 95 km outer ring road costing $110 million was approved in 2017.http://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/officials-say-kabul-ring-road-construction-start-soonrta.org.af/eng/2017/09/17/idb-pays-74m-loan-for-construction-of-kabul-city-ring-road/ Construction will take five years and it will run from Char Asiab via Ahmad Shah Baba Mina, Deh Sabz (\"Kabul New City\" development area), the AH76 highway, Paghman and back to Char Asyab.https://www.khaama.com/president-ghani-kabuls-ring-road-important-economical-project-3768 A new bus public transport service is also planned to be opened in 2018 (see below).http://kbr.id/english/07-2017/amid_chaos__kabul_gears_up_for_pioneering_metro_bus_service/91148.html In September 2017, the head of the Kabul Municipality announced that 286 meters of pedestrian overpass footbridges will be built in eight busy areas \"in the near future\".http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/09/17/building-fly-overs-in-kabul/\n\nUnder the Kabul Urban Transport Efficiency Improvement Project that was signed in 2014 and backed by the World Bank, the city has seen widespread improvements in road conditions, including the building of new pedestrian sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting and asphalted road surfaces. The project runs until December 31, 2019.http://projects.worldbank.org/P131864?lang=enhttps://nl4worldbank.org/2017/06/09/urban-transport-program-helps-keep-kabul-clean/\n\nPrivate vehicles have been on the rise in Kabul since 2002, with about 700,000 cars registered as of 2013 and up to 80% of the cars reported to be Toyota Corollas.http://www.autonews.com/article/20130626/BLOG06/130629915/why-the-corolla-is-so-popular----even-in-afghanistanAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/09/2565599.htm Dodgy cars clogging Kabul's roads] The number of dealerships have also increased from 77 in 2003 to over 550 by 2010.https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/afghanistan/corolla-s-the-car-of-choice-in-kabul-1.112845 Gas stations are mainly private-owned. Bicycles on the road are a common sight in the city.\n\nTaxis\n\nThe taxicabs in Kabul are painted in a white and yellow livery. The majority of these are older model Corollas. A few Soviet-era Russian cabs are also still in operation.\n\nBuses and trolleybuses\n\nLong distance road journeys are made by private Mercedes-Benz coach buses or various types of vans, trucks and cars. Although a nationwide bus service is available from Kabul, flying is safer, especially for foreigners. The city's public bus service (Millie Bus / \"National Bus\") was established in the 1960s to take commuters on daily routes to many destinations. The service currently has about 800 buses. The Kabul bus system has recently discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from MTN similar to \"bus wrap\" advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There is also an express bus that runs from downtown to Hamid Karzai International Airport for Safi Airways passengers.\n\nAn electric trolleybus system operated in Kabul from February 1979 to 1992 using Škoda fleet built by a Czechoslovak company (see Trolleybuses in Kabul for more). The trolleybus service was highly popular mainly due to its low price compared to the Millie Bus conventional bus service. The last trolleybus came to a halt in late 1992 due to warfare. The copper overhead wires were subsequently looted and sold to scrap dealers. The steel poles can still be seen in Kabul today.\n\nIn June 2017 Kabul Municipality unveiled plans for a new bus rapid transit (BRT) system (referred to as \"Metro Bus\"), the first major urban public transportation scheme. The initial route of 8 km will run from De Afghanan in central Kabul to Sara-e Shamali Square in the north-west via Baraki Square and Karte Parwan. The second phase would connect De Afghanan westwards to Kote Sangi via Deh Mazang and Karte Char. Work is underway for a 2018 opening. In the next phases the service will expand to about 111 km by 2020, including covering Dashte Barchi in the west, Darulaman in the south, and Karte Naw in the east.https://www.khaama.com/kabul-municipality-unveils-new-developments-in-metro-bus-project-03420http://www.tolonews.com/business/kabul-municipality-unveils-first-metro-bus-systemhttp://www.1tvnews.af/en/news/afghanistan/29784-kabul-metro-bus-project-to-be-launched-today\n\nEducation\n\nThe Ministry of Education led by Ghulam Farooq Wardak is responsible for the education system in Afghanistan. Public and private schools in the city have reopened since 2002 after they were shut down or destroyed during fighting in the 1980s to the late 1990s. Boys and girls are strongly encouraged to attend school under the Karzai administration but many more schools are needed not only in Kabul but throughout the country. The Afghan Ministry of Education has plans to build more schools in the coming years so that education is provided to all citizens of the country. The most well known high schools in Kabul include:\n* Habibia High School, a British-Afghan school founded in 1903 by King Habibullah Khan\n* Lycée Esteqlal, a Franco-Afghan school founded in 1922\n* Malalai High School, a Franco-Afghan school for girls\n* Amani High School, a German-Afghan school for boys founded in 1924\n* Aisha-i-Durani School, a German-Afghan school for girls\n* Rahman Baba High School, an American-Afghan school for boys\n* International School of Kabul, an American-Afghan school\n* Afghan Turk High Schools, Turkish-Afghan schools\n* Ghulam Haider Khan High School, a school for boys\n* Abdul Hadi Dawi High School, a school for boys\n* Nazo Ana High School, a school for girls\n\nUniversities\n\nThe city's colleges and universities were renovated after 2002. Some of them have been developed recently, while others have existed since the early 20th century.\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care in Afghanistan is relatively poor. The wealthy Afghans usually go abroad when seeking treatment. Presently, there are several hospitals in Kabul which include;\n\n* French Medical Institute for Children\n* Kabul City Hospital\n* Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital\n* Jamhuriat Hospital\n* Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan Hospital\n* Jinnah Hospital (under construction)\n* Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital\n* Malalai Maternity Hospital\n* Rabia-I-Balki Maternity Hospital\n* Maywand Hospital\n* Afshar Hospital\n* Noor Eye Hospital\n* Atatürk Children's Hospital\n* American Medical Center Afghanistan\n* DK-German Medical Diagnostic Center\n* CURE International Hospital\n* KIA ISAF Role 3 Hospital\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\n*  Ankara, Turkey (since 2003)\n* Delhi, India (proposed, 2017)https://thediplomat.com/2015/09/india-and-afghanistan-a-growing-partnership/\n*  Istanbul, Turkey (since 1992)\n*  Kazan, Russia (since 2005)Cultures and Globalization: Cities, Cultural Policy and Governance by Helmut K Anheier, p.376\n* Omaha, Nebraska, United States (since 2003)https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/cities-afghanistan-and-nebraska-forge-sister-cities-partnership.
