  "textBody" : "This article is about the demographic features of the population of Cambodia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nPopulation\n\nBetween 1874 and 1921, the total population of Cambodia increased from about 946,000 to 2.4 million. By 1950, it had increased to between 3,710,107 and 4,073,967, and in 1962 it had reached 5.7 million. From the 1960s until 1975, the population of Cambodia increased by about 2.2% yearly, the lowest increase in Southeast Asia. By 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, it was estimated at 7.3 million. Of this total an estimated one to two million reportedly died between 1975 and 1978. In 1981, the PRK gave the official population figure as nearly 6.7 million, although approximately 6.3 million to 6.4 million is probably more accurate. The average annual rate of population growth from 1978 to 1985 was 2.3% (see table 2, Appendix A). A post-Khmer Rouge baby boom pushed the population above 10 million, although growth has slowed in recent years.\n\nIn 1959, about 45% of the population was under 15 years of age. By 1962, this had increased slightly to 46%. In 1962, an estimated 52% of the population was between 15 and 64 years of age, while 2% were older than 65. The percentage of males and females in the three groups was almost the same.\n\nPopulation and age distribution[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]\n\nStructure of the populationhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates) (Excluding foreign diplomatic personnel and their dependants. Data based on the 2008 Population Census) :\n\nVital statistics\n\nUN estimates\n\nBirths and deathshttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/vitstats/serATab3.pdf\n\nFertility\n\nThe total fertility rate in Cambodia was 3.0 children per woman in 2010. The fertility rate was 4.0 children in 2000. Women in urban areas have 2.2 children on average, compared with 3.3 children per woman in rural areas. Fertility is highest in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri Provinces, where women have an average of 4.5 children, and lowest in Phnom Penh where women have an average of 2.0 children.[http://www.nis.gov.kh/ National Institute of Statistics CAMBODIA DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY 2010]\n\nFertility and Births\n\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/1421\nhttp://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR251/OD43.pdf\n\nTotal fertility rate and other related statistics by province, as of 2014:[http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR312/FR312.pdf Cambodia DHS, 2014 - Final Report (English)]\n\nInfant and childhood mortality\n\nChildhood mortality rates are decreasing in Cambodia. Currently, the infant mortality rate is 45 deaths per 1,000 live births for the five-year period before the survey compared with 66 deaths reported in the 2005 CDHS and 95 in the 2000 CDHS. Under-five mortality rates have also decreased from 124 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000, 83 deaths in 2005 to 54 deaths per 1,000 in 2010.\n\nChildhood mortality decreases markedly with mother’s education and wealth. Infant mortality, for example, is twice as high among children whose mothers have no schooling compared to those with secondary or higher education (72 versus 31). The association with wealth is even stronger. There are 77 deaths per 1,000 live births among infants from the poorest households compared to only 23 deaths per 1,000 live births among infants from the richest households.\n\nMortality rates are much higher in rural than urban areas. Infant mortality, for example, is 64 deaths per 1,000 live births in rural areas compared to only 22 in urban areas.\nMortality also differs by province. Infant mortality ranges from only 13 deaths per 1,000 live births in Phnom Penh to 78 deaths per 1,000 live births in Kampong Chhnang and Svay Rieng.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nIn 1959, life expectancy at birth was 44.2 years for males and 43.3 years for females. By 1970, life expectancy had increased by about 2.5 years since 1945. The greater longevity for females apparently reflected improved health practices during maternity and childbirth.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nThe largest of the ethnic groups in Cambodia are the Khmer, who comprise approximately 90% of the total population and primarily inhabit the lowland Mekong subregion and the central plains. \n\nThe Khmer historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous arc that runs from the southern Khorat Plateau where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northeast, stretching southwest through the lands surrounding Tonle Sap lake to the Cardamom Mountains, then continues back southeast to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.\n\nEthnic groups in Cambodia other than the politically and socially dominant Khmer are classified as either \"indigenous ethnic minorities\" or \"non-indigenous ethnic minorities\". The indigenous ethnic minorities, more commonly collectively referred to as the Khmer Loeu (\"upland Khmer\"), constitute the majority in the remote mountainous provinces of Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri and Stung Treng and are present in substantial numbers in Kratie Province. \n\nApproximately 17-21 separate ethnic groups, most of whom speak Austroasiatic languages related to Khmer, are included in the Khmer Loeu designation, including the Kuy and Tampuan people. These peoples are considered by the Khmer to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Two of these highland groups, the Rade and the Jarai, are Chamic peoples who speak Austronesian languages descended from ancient Cham. These indigenous ethnic minorities haven't integrated into Khmer culture and follow their traditional animist beliefs.\n\nThe non-indigenous ethnic minorities include immigrants and their descendants who live among the Khmer and have adopted, at least nominally, Khmer culture and language. The three groups most often included are the Chinese Cambodians, Vietnamese and Cham peoples. The Chinese have immigrated to Cambodia from different regions of China throughout Cambodia's history, integrating into Cambodian society and today Chinese Cambodians or Cambodians of mixed Sino-Khmer ancestry dominate the business community, politics and the media. The Cham are descendants of refugees from the various wars of the historical kingdom of Champa. The Cham live amongst the Khmer in the central plains but in contrast to the Khmer who are Theravada Buddhists, the vast majority of Cham follow Islam.\n\nThere are also small numbers of other minority groups. Tai peoples in Cambodia include the Lao along the Mekong at the northeast border, Thai (urban and rural), and the culturally Burmese Kola, who have visibly influenced the culture of Pailin Province. Even smaller numbers of recent Hmong immigrants reside along the Lao border and various Burmese peoples have immigrated to the capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nKhmer 90%, Vietnamese 5%, Chinese 1%, other 4%.CIA factbook\n\nLanguages\n\n;Official language:Khmer\n;Languages of education:English, Frenchhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html (3%, 423,000 French speakers La langue française dans le monde, 2014, Éditions Nathan, p. 18.).\n;Minority languages:Cham, Vietnamese, Tumpoon, Lao, Jarai, Yue Chinese, Teochew Chinese, and many other indigenous Mon–Khmer languages \n;Sign languages:American Sign Language\n\nReligions\n\nBuddhism: 95%, Islam: 1.6%, Christianity: 0.2%, Others: 3.2%\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nPopulation\n\n15,957,223\n\nNote: estimates for this country take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2016 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n* 1.56% (2016 est.)\n* 1.698% (2011 est.)\n* 1.71% (2010 est.)\n* 1.77% (2009 est.)\n* 1.75% (2008 est)\n\nSex ratio\n\nAt birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n0-14 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n15-24 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\n25-54 years: 0.96 male(s)/female\n55-64 years: 0.65 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.6 male(s)/female\nTotal Population: 0.94 male(s)/female (2016 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\nTotal population: 64.5 years\nMale: 62 years\nFemale: 67.1 years (2016 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nAdult prevalence rate\n0.63% (2015 est.)\n\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS\n74,100 (2015 est.)\n63,000 (2009 est.)\n75,000 (2007 est.)\n\nDeaths\n1,000 (2011 est.)\n2,000 (2015 est.)\n3,100 (2009 est.)\n6,900 (2007 est.)\n\nNationality\n\nNoun: Cambodian(s) or Khmer(s)\nAdjective: Cambodian or Khmer\n\nUrbanization\n\nUrban population: 20.7% of total population (2015)\nRate of urbanization: 2.65% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)\n\nLiteracy\n\nDefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\nTotal population: 77.2%\nMale: 84.5%\nFemale: 70.5% (2015 est.)\n\nEducatate expendiure\n\n1.9% of GDP (2014)\n\nDiaspora\n\nCountries with notable populations of Cambodians are:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*",
