  "textBody" : "In phonology, an allophone (; from the , állos, \"other\" and φωνή, phōnē, \"voice, sound\") is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds (or phones) or signs used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language. For example, Aspirated consonant| (as in pin) and (as in spin which is less aspirated) are allophones for the phoneme in the English language. The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context (such allophones are called positional variants), but sometimes allophones occur in free variation. Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme will usually not change the meaning of a word, although sometimes the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible. Native speakers of a given language usually perceive one phoneme in that language as a single distinctive sound, and are \"both unaware of and even shocked by\" the allophone variations used to pronounce single phonemes.\n\nHistory of concept\n\nThe term \"allophone\" was coined by Benjamin Lee Whorf in the 1940s. In doing so, he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.\n\nComplementary and free-variant allophones and assimilation\n\nEvery time a user's speech is vocalized for a given phoneme, it will be slightly different from other utterances, even for the same speaker. This has led to some debate over how real, and how universal, phonemes really are (see phoneme for details). Only some of the variation is significant (i.e., detectable or perceivable) to speakers. There are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation, or whether the speaker has freedom to (unconsciously) choose which allophone to use.\n\nWhen a specific allophone (from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme) must be selected in a given context (i.e., using a different allophone for a phoneme will cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native), the allophones are said to be 'complementary' (i.e., the allophones complement each other, and one is not used in a situation where the usage of another is standard). In the case of complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a phonological process.\n\nIn other cases, the speaker is able to select freely from free variant allophones, based on personal habit or preference.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is assimilation, wherein a phoneme is to sound more like the other phoneme. One example of assimilation is consonant voicing and devoicing, wherein voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\nAllotone\n\nA tonic allophone is sometimes called an allotone, for example in the neutral tone of Mandarin.\n\nExamples \n\nEnglish \n\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English, like lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* Aspiration – strong explosion of breath. In English a voiceless plosive (that is p, t or k) is aspirated whenever it stands as the consonant at the beginning of the stressed syllable or of the first, stressed or unstressed, syllable in a word. For example, as in pin and as in spin are allophones for the phoneme because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in complementary distribution). English speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated (plain). Many languages treat these two phones differently; see Aspirated consonant, section Usage patterns.\n* Nasal plosion – In English a plosive has nasal plosion when it is followed by a nasal, inside a word or across word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of sonorants – In English sonorants are partially devoiced when they follow a voiceless sound within the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants – In English a sonorant is completely devoiced when it follows an aspirated plosive.\n* Partial devoicing of obstruents – In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound, inside a word or across its boundary.\n* Retraction – in English are retracted before.\n\nBecause the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control, people may not realize they exist. English speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme, namely unreleased as in cat, aspirated as in top, glottalized as in button, flapped as in American English water, nasalized flapped as in winter, and none of the above as in stop. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*Night rate: unreleased (without word space between and)\n*Nitrate:  aspirated or retracted\n\nIf a flame is held before the lips while these words are spoken, it flickers more during aspirated nitrate than during unaspirated night rate. The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a Mandarin speaker, to whom and are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than it is to the English speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore it.\n\nAllophones of English may be noticed if the 'light' of leaf is contrasted with the 'dark' of feel. Again, this difference is much more obvious to a Turkish speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nCross-language comparison\n\nThere are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation. (See e.g. Hawaiian and Toki Pona.)  Examples (links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon):\n* Consonant allophones\n** Final devoicing, in particular Final-obstruent devoicing: Arapaho, English, Nahuatl and many others\n** Voicing of initial letter \n** Anticipatory assimilation\n** Aspiration changes: Algonquin \n** Frication between vowels: Dahalo\n** Lenition: Manx \n** Voicing of clicks: Dahalo\n\n** Allophones for /b/: Arapaho, Xavante\n** Allophones for /d/: Xavante\n** Allophones for /f/: Bengali\n** Allophones for /j/: Xavante\n** Allophones for /k/: Manam\n** Allophones for /pʰ/: Garhwali\n** [e] and [o] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ in closed final syllables in Malaysian, Singapore and Sumatra and [ɪ] and [ʊ] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ in Indonesian.\n** [l] and [n] as allophones: Some dialects of Hawaiian\n** Allophones for /n/\n*** [ŋ]: Finnish and many more.\n*** wide range of variation in Japanese (as archiphoneme /N/) \n** Allophones for /r/: Xavante\n** Allophones for /ɽ/: Bengali\n** Allophones for /s/: Bengali, Taos \n** [t] and [k] as allophones: Hawaiian\n** Allophones for /w/:\n*** [v] and [w]: Hindustani, Hawaiian\n*** fricative [β] before unrounded vowels: O'odham\n** Allophones for /z/: Bengali\n* Vowel allophones\n** Polish\n** Russian\n** Allophones for /i/, /a/ and /u/: Nuxálk\n* Vowel/consonant allophones\n** Vowels become glides in diphthongs: Manam\n\nRepresenting a phoneme with an allophone \n\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct phonetic transcription. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple broad transcription is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, so that the allophony is significant, things become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, then that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than this allows. In such cases a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules. For example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable; elsewhere they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic; nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the world's languages than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory. Another alternative, commonly employed for archiphonemes, is the use of a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [ŋ].\n\nIn rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as dingbats, so as not to privilege any one allophone.",
