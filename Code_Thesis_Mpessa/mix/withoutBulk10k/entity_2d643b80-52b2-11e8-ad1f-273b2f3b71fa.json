London Colchester 1959 (first: 1843), pp. 542. is the informal fallacy of presenting an argument that may or may not be logically valid, but fails nonetheless to address the issue in question.  More colloquially, it is also known as missing the point.\n\nOverview\n\nIgnoratio elenchi falls into the broad class of relevance fallacies. It is one of the fallacies identified by Aristotle in his Organon. In a broader sense he asserted that all fallacies are a form of ignoratio elenchi.\n\nThe phrase ignoratio elenchi is . Here elenchi is the genitive singular of the Latin noun elenchus, which is .  The translation in English of the Latin expression has varied somewhat. Hamblin proposed \"misconception of refutation\" or \"ignorance of refutation\" as a literal translation, John Arthur Oesterle preferred \"ignoring the issue\", and  Irving Copi, Christopher Tindale and others used \"irrelevant conclusion\".\n\n● Example 1: A and B are debating as to whether criticizing indirectly has any merit in general. \nA: There is no point in people ranting on social media about politics; the president is not going to read it anyway.\nB: But it is their social media.

The question was not if the law should allow, but if it does or not.\n\nDr Johnson's unique \"refutation\" of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist, has been described as ignoratio elenchi:Bagnall, Nicholas.
