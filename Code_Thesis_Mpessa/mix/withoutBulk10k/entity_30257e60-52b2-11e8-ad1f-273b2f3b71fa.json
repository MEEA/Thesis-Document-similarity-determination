  "textBody" : "Conjugation has two meanings.Merriam-Webster online dictionary [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conjugation \"Conjugation\"]. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. It may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, mood, aspect, voice, or other language-specific factors. \n\nThe second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on.\n\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin coniugātiō, which is a translation of the Greek  ', literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\n\nThe ancient Romans themselves divided their verbs into three conjugations (coniugationes verbis accidunt tres: prima, secunda, tertia \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus)), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an a, an e or an i in it.Donatus [Ars Maior], 10.16. However, modern grammarianse.g. Gildersleeve and Lodge, 3rd edition (1895), §120. usually divide the regular verbs into four different groups according to whether their active present infinitive has the ending -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre (or the passive equivalent of these), for example: (1) amō, amāre \"to love\", (2) videō, vidēre \"to see\", (3) regō, regere \"to rule\" and (4) audiō, audīre \"to hear\". There are also some verbs of mixed conjugation, having some endings like the 3rd and others like the 4th conjugation, for example, capiō, capere \"to capture\" and orior, orīrī \"to arise\".\n\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most important of these is the verb sum, esse \"to be\". There also exist deponent and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as defective verbs (verbs in which some of the tenses are missing).\n \nFor simple verb paradigms, see the appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\n\nProperties  \n\nThe Latin verbs have the following properties:\n* three persons: first, second, and third;\n* two numbers: singular and plural;\n* three tenses: present, past, and future, and two aspects: perfective (finished) and imperfective (unfinished), which combine to form six tenses: present, perfect, imperfect, Pluperfect, future, and future perfect;\n* three finite moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative, of which only the indicative is conjugated fully in all tenses and persons;\n* five non-finite forms: infinitive, gerund, participle, and supine; and gerundive.\n* two voices: active and passive.\n\nPrincipal parts \n\nThere are four conjugations in Latin which define patterns of verb inflection. However the grouping in conjugations is based on the behaviour of the verb in the present system; the stems for other forms cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\n\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are therefore listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs) which allow the reader to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\n# the first person singular of the present indicative active\n# the present infinitive active\n# the first person singular of the perfect indicative active\n# the supine or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs. Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.\n\nFirst conjugation \n\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel ā and can be recognized by the -āre ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n* perfect has the suffix –āvī. The majority of first-conjugation verbs adhere to this pattern, which is considered to be \"regular\", for example:\n** portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum, \"to carry, to bring\";\n** amō, amāre, amāvī, amātum, \"to love, to be fond of\";\n* perfect has the suffix –uī, for example:\n** secō, secāre, secuī, sectum, \"to cut, to divide\";\n** fricō, fricāre, fricuī, frictum, \"to rub\";\n** vetō, vetāre, vetuī, vetitum, \"to forbid, to prohibit\";\n* perfect has the suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:\n** lavō, lavāre, lāvī, lautum, \"to wash, to bathe\";\n** iuvō, iuvāre, iūvī, iūtum, \"to help, to assist\";\n* perfect is reduplicated, for example:\n** stō, stāre, stetī, statum, \"to stand\";\n** dō, dare, dedī, datum, \"to give\"; this verb is irregular, since except in the 2nd singular (dā, dās) the a is short (dăre, dătum, dăbō etc.)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:Gildersleeve & Lodge, Latin Grammar (1895), §163.\n*arbitror, arbitrārī, arbitrātus sum (to think)\n*cōnor, cōnārī, cōnātus sum (to try)\n*cūnctor, cūnctāri, cūnctātus sum (to hesitate)\n\nSecond conjugation \n\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ē, and can be recognized by the -eō ending of the first person present indicative and the -ēre ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n* perfect has the suffix –uī. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\n** terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum (to frighten, to deter)\n** doceō, docēre, docuī, doctum (to teach, to instruct)\n** teneō, tenēre, tenuī, tentum (to hold, to keep)\n* perfect has the suffix –ēvī. Examples:\n** dēleō, dēlēre, dēlēvī, dēlētum (to destroy, to efface)\n** cieō, ciēre, cīvī, citum (to arouse, to stir)\n* perfect has the suffix –sī (which combines with a preceding c or g to –xī). Examples:\n** augeō, augēre, auxī, auctum (to increase, to enlarge)\n** iubeō, iubēre, iussī, iussum (to order, to bid)\n* perfect is reduplicated with –ī. Examples:\n** mordeō, mordēre, momordī, morsum (to bite, to nip)\n** spondeō, spondēre, spopondī, spōnsum (to vow, to promise)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** videō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsum (to see, to notice)\n** foveō, fovēre, fōvī, fōtum (to caress, to cherish)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and no perfect passive participle. Examples:\n** strīdeō, strīdēre, strīdī (to hiss, to creak)\n** ferveō, fervēre, fervī (sometimes fervuī or ferbuī) (to boil, to seethe)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of terreō, but fateor and confiteor have a perfect participle with ss:Gildersleeve & Lodge, Latin Grammar (1895), §164.\n* mereor, merērī, meritus sum (to deserve)\n* polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum (to promise)\n* fateor, fatērī, fassus sum (to confess)\n\nThird conjugation \n\nThe third conjugation is characterized by a short thematic vowel, which alternates between e, i, and u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in –ere in the present active infinitive. There is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:\n* perfect has suffix –sī (–xī when c or h comes at the end of the root). Examples:\n** carpō, carpere, carpsī, carptum (to pluck, to select)\n** trahō, trahere, trāxī, trāctum (to drag, to draw)\n** gerō, gerere, gessī, gestum (to wear, to bear)\n** flectō, flectere, flexī, flexum (to bend, to twist)\n* perfect is reduplicated with suffix –ī. Examples:\n** currō, currere, cucurrī, cursum (to run, to race)\n** caedō, caedere, cecīdī, caesum (to kill, to slay)\n** tangō, tangere, tetigī, tāctum (to touch, to hit)\n** pellō, pellere, pepulī, pulsum (to beat, to drive away)\n* perfect has suffix -vī. Examples:\n** petō, petere, petīvī, petītum (to seek, to attack)\n** linō, linere, līvī, lītum (to smear, to befoul)\n** serō, serere, sēvī, satum (to sow, to plant)\n** terō, terere, trīvī, trītum (to rub, to wear out)\n** sternō, sternere, strāvī, strātus (to spread, to stretch out)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** agō, agere, ēgī, āctum (to do, to drive)\n** legō, legere, lēgī, lēctum (to collect, to read)\n** emō, emere, ēmī, ēmptum (to buy, to purchase)\n** vincō, vincere, vīcī, victum (to conquer, to master)\n** fundō, fundere, fūdī, fūsum (to pour, to utter)\n* perfect has suffix –ī only. Examples:\n** īcō, īcere, īcī, īctum (to strike, to smite)\n** vertō, vertere, vertī, versum (to turn, to alter)\n** vīsō, vīsere, vīsī, vīsum (to visit)\n* perfect has suffix –uī. Examples:\n** metō, metere, messuī, messum (to reap, to harvest)\n** vomō, vomere, vomuī, vomitum (to vomit)\n** colō, colere, coluī, cultum (to cultivate, to till)\n** texō, texere, texuī, textum (to weave, to plait)\n** gignō, gignere, genuī, genitum (to beget, to cause)\n* Present tense indicative first person singular form has suffix with –scō. Examples:\n** nōscō, nōscere, nōvī, nōtum (to get to know, to learn)\n** adolēscō, adolēscere, adolēvī (to grow up, to mature)\n** flōrēscō, flōrēscere, flōruī (to begin to flourish, to blossom)\n** haerēscō, haerēscere, haesī, haesum (to adhere, to stick)\n** pāscō, pāscere, pāvī, pāstum (to feed upon, to feed (an animal))\n\nDeponent verbs in the 3rd conjugation include the following:\n*lābor, lābī, lāpsus sum (to glide)\n*loquor, loquī, locūtus sum (to speak)\n*oblīvīscor, oblīvīscī, oblītus sum (to forget)\n*sequor, sequī, secūtus sum (to follow)\n*ūtor, ūtī, ūsus sum (to use)\n\nThird conjugation –iō verbs\n\nIntermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the third-conjugation verbs with suffix –iō. These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. Some examples are:\n*capiō, capere, cēpī, captum (to take, capture)\n*faciō, facere, fēcī, factum (to do, to make)\n*rapiō, rapere, rapuī, raptum (to plunder, take up, seize)\n*cupiō, cupere, cupīvī, cupītum (to desire, long for)\n\nDeponent verbs in this group include:\n*morior, morī, mortuus sum (to die)\n*patior, patī, passus sum (to suffer, to allow)\n*aggredior, aggredī, aggressus sum (to attack)\n\nThey resemble the fourth conjugation in the following parts of the verb:\n\nPresent indicative (first person singular, third person plural): capiō, capiunt.\nIndicative imperfect: capiēbam, capiēbāmus.\nIndicative future: capiam, capiēmus.\nSubjunctive present: capiam, capiāmus\nImperative future (third person plural): capiuntō\nPresent Active Participle: capiēns, -entis\nGerund: capiendī, capiendum (also capiundī)\nGerundive: capiendus, –a, –um (also capiundus)\n\nFourth conjugation \n\nThe fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel ī and can be recognized by the –īre ending of the present active infinitive. Principal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:\n* perfect has suffix –vī. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\n** audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum (to hear, listen (to))\n** mūniō, mūnīre, mūnīvī, mūnītum (to fortify, to build)\n* perfect has suffix –uī. Examples:\n** aperiō, aperīre, aperuī, apertum (to open, to uncover)\n* perfect has suffix –sī (-xī when c comes at the end of the root). Examples:\n** saepiō, saepīre, saepsī, saeptum (to surround, to enclose)\n** sanciō, sancīre, sānxī, sānctum (to confirm, to ratify)\n** sentiō, sentīre, sēnsī, sēnsum (to feel, to perceive)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** veniō, venīre, vēnī, ventum (to come, to arrive)\n\nDeponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:Gildersleeve & Lodge Latin Grammar (1985), §166.\n*assentior, assentīrī, assēnsus sum (to assent)\n*largior, largīrī, largītus sum (to bestow)\n*mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum (to tell a lie)\n*mētior, mētīrī, mēnsus sum (to measure)\n*sortior, sortīrī, sortītus sum (to cast lots)\n\nThe verb orior, orīrī, ortus sum (to arise) is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense oritur and imperfect subjunctive orerer, have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound adorior (to rise up, attack) is entirely 4th conjugation.\n\nPersonal endings \n\nPersonal endings are used in all tenses. The present, imperfect, future, pluperfect and future perfect use the same personal endings in the active voice. However, the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect do not have personal endings in the passive voice. These are formed by a participle and a form of esse (to be). For example, the perfect passive 1st person singular form of the verb amāre (to love) is amatus sum, using the participle and sum rather than the perfect stem amav- and some form of -ir. The perfect uses its own personal endings in the active voice, which are shown in the chart below.\n\nImperfective aspect tenses \n\nThe tenses of the imperfective aspect are present, imperfect, and future tense. Verb forms in the imperfective aspect express an action that has (or had) not been completed. Consider for concreteness the following verbs:\n* the first conjugation verb portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum (to carry, to bring)\n* the second conjugation verb terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum (to frighten, to deter)\n* the third conjugation verb petō, petere, petīvī, petītum (to seek, to attack)\n* the fourth conjugation verb audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum (to hear, to listen (to))\n\nIn all the conjugations except for the third conjugation, the –re is removed from the second principal part (for example, portāre without the suffix –re becomes portā–) to form the present stem, which is used for all of the tenses in the imperfective aspect. In the third conjugation, the –ō ending of the present indicative is dropped in order to form the present stem (for example, the present indicative form of regere is regō, and without the -ō it is the present stem, reg–). Occasionally, the terminating vowel of the stem is lengthened and/or shortened, and sometimes completely changed. This is often true both in the third conjugation and in the subjunctive mood of all conjugations.\n\nPresent tense \n\nThe present tense (Latin tempus praesēns) is used to show an uncompleted action that happens in the current time. The present tense does not have a tense sign. Instead, the personal endings are added to the bare present stem. However, in this tense the thematic vowel, most notably the ě in the third conjugation, changes the most frequently.\n\nPresent indicative \n\nThe present indicative expresses general truths, facts, demands and desires. Most commonly, a verb like portō can be translated as \"I carry,\" \"I do carry,\" or \"I am carrying\". In all but the third conjugation, only the thematical vowel of the stem is used. In the third conjugation, the e is only used in the second person singular in the passive for a less difficult pronunciation. Otherwise, it becomes either an i or u. The first person singular of the indicative active present is the first principal part. All end in –ō.\n\nAdd the passive endings to form the passive voice. The passive portor can be translated as \"I am carried,\" or \"I am being carried\".\n\nNotice that in the second person singular of petere, the thematic vowel is e (peteris, not petiris).\n\nPresent subjunctive \n\nThe present subjunctive may be used to assert many things. In general, in independent sentences, it is translated hortatorily (only in the third person plural), jussively and optatively. Portem can be translated as \"Let me carry.\" or \"May I carry.\" Portēmus can be \"Let us carry\".\n\nSome alterations have occurred in the vowels from the indicative and subjunctive.\n*The first conjugation now uses an e and an ē.\n*The second conjugation uses ea and eā.\n*The third conjugation uses a or ā.\n*The fourth conjugation uses ia or iā.\n\n\"Let's beat that giant\", \"Defeat all liars\", or \"She wears a diamond/tiara\" are helpful mnemonics for remembering this.  First conjugation verbs have an \"e\" in their stem (we), second conjugation verbs have an \"-ea\" (eat), third conjugation verbs have an \"a\" (caviar), and fourths have an \"ia\" (caviar).\n\nLike the indicative, active personal endings may be replaced by passive personal endings. Porter can be translated as \"Let me be carried\" or \"May I be carried.\" Hortatorily, Portēmur can be \"Let us be carried\".\n\nPresent imperative \n\nThe present imperative conveys commands, pleas and recommendations. Portā can be translated as \"(You) Carry\" or simply, \"Carry\". The imperative present occurs only in the second person.\n*The second person singular in the active voice uses only the bare stem, and does not add an imperative ending.\n\nThe imperative present of the passive voice is rarely used, except in the case of deponent verbs, whose passive forms carry active meaning. Portāminī can be translated as \"(You) Be carried\".  The deponent sequiminī, on the other hand, means \"(You) Follow!\".\n*The singular uses the alternate form of the present passive indicative (which looks like the present active infinitive) and the plural uses the present passive indicative form of the second person plural.\n\nImperfect \n\nThe imperfect (Latin tempus praeteritum imperfectum) indicates a perpetual, but incomplete action in the past. It is recognized by the tense signs bă and bā in the indicative, and re and rē in the subjunctive.\n\nImperfect indicative \n\nThe imperfect indicative simply expresses an action in the past that was not completed. Portābam can be translated to mean, \"I was carrying,\" \"I carried,\" or \"I used to carry\".\n*In the indicative, the imperfect employs its tense signs ba and bā before personal endings are added.\n\nAs with the present tense, active personal endings are taken off, and passive personal endings are put in their place. Portābar can be translated as \"I was being carried,\" \"I kept being carried,\" or \"I used to be carried\".\n\nImperfect subjunctive \n\nIn the subjunctive, the imperfect is quite important, especially in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is largely translated conditionally. Portārem can mean, \"I should carry,\" or \"I would carry\".\n*Unlike the indicative, the subjunctive does not modify the thematic vowel. The third conjugation's thematical remains short as an e, and the fourth conjugation does not use an iē before the imperfect signs. It keeps its ī.\n*In the subjunctive, the imperfect employs its tense signs re and rē before personal endings.\n*The verb esse (to be) has two imperfect subjunctives: one using the present infinitive (essem, esses, esset, essemus, essetis, essent) and one using the future infinitive (forem, fores, foret, foremus, foretis, forent).\n\nAs with the indicative subjunctive, active endings are removed, and passive endings are added. Portārer may be translated as \"I should be carried,\" or \"I would be carried.\"\n\nFuture tense \n\nThe future tense (Latin tempus futūrum simplex) expresses an uncompleted action in the future. It is recognized by its tense signs bō, bi, bu, a and ē in the indicative and the vowel ō in the imperative mood.\n\nFuture indicative \n\nThe future tense always refers to an incomplete action. In addition, the future tense is stricter in usage temporally in Latin than it is in English. Standing alone, portābō can mean, \"I shall carry,\" or \"I will carry.\"\n*The first and second conjugations use bō, bi and bu as signs for the future indicative.\n*The third and fourth conjugations replace their thematic vowels with a, ě and ē. The fourth conjugation inserts an ǐ before the a, e and ē.\n\nAs with all imperfective system tenses, active personal endings are removed, and passive personal endings are put on. Portābor translates as, \"I shall be carried.\"\n\nNotice that the penultimate vowel in the second person singular of portāre and terrēre is e, not i (portāberis and terrēberis, instead of the expected portābiris and terrēbiris).\n\nFuture imperative \n\nThe future imperative was a formal form of the imperative; by the classical period, it was chiefly used in legal documents, though it retained some currency in distinct reference to future time.Allen, Joseph and James Greenough. Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar. New York: Ginn & Co., 1888. 282.   A few irregular or defective verbs (meminisse 'remember') used this form as their only imperative.\n\nPortātō can be translated as \"You shall carry\".\n*As mentioned previously, the vowel ō is used as a sign of the future imperative.\n\nThe ending -r marks the passive voice in the future imperative. The second person plural is absent here. Portātor translates as \"You shall be carried.\"\n\nPerfective aspect tenses \n\nThe tenses of the perfective aspect, which are the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses, are used to express actions that have been, had been, or will have been completed. The verbs used for explanation are:\n\n1st conjugation: portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum – to carry, bring\n2nd conjugation: terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum – to frighten, deter\n3rd conjugation: petō, petere, petīvī, petītum – to seek, attack\n4th conjugation: audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum – to hear, listen (to)\n\nTo find the stem for the third principal part in all of the conjugations, the –ī is removed from it. For example, from portāvī, portāv is formed. This is the perfect stem, and it is used for all of the tenses in the perfective aspect. The perfective aspect verbs also use the perfect passive participle in the passive voice. See below to see how it is formed. Along with these participles, the verb esse, which means, \"to be\", is used.\n\nUnlike the imperfective aspect, inflection does not deviate from conjugation to conjugation.\n\nPerfect \n\nThe perfect (Latin tempus praeteritum perfectum) refers to an action completed in the past. Tense signs are only used in this tense with the indicative. The tense signs of the subjunctive are eri and erī.\n\nPerfect indicative \n\nThe indicative perfect expresses a finished action in the past. If the action were not finished, but still lies in the past, one would use the imperfect. Portāvī is translated as \"I carried,\" \"I did carry,\" or \"I have carried.\"\n*As aforementioned, the indicative perfect in the active voice has its special personal endings.\n\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with the auxiliary verb esse. It uses the present indicative form of esse. Portātus sum translates as \"I was carried,\" or \"I have been carried.\"\n\nNote the participle changes from singular to plural when the subject changes respectively. Treat the participle as an adjective with only nominative singular and plural forms. The participle must also be declined for gender. This can be done by removing the -us on the participle and adding -us, -a, -um with the plural being: -i -ae -a. -us, -i is Masculine, -a, -ae is Feminine, and -um, -a is neuter.\n\nPerfect subjunctive \n\nLike the imperfect subjunctive, the perfect subjunctive is largely used in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is usually translated as the potential subjunctive. By itself, portāverim translates as \"I may have carried.\"\n*The tense signs eri and erī are used before the personal endings are added.\n\nThe passive voice uses the perfect passive participle with the subjunctive present forms of esse. Portātus sim means, \"I may have been carried.\"\n\nPluperfect \n\nThe pluperfect (Latin tempus praeteritum plūsquamperfectum) expresses an action which was completed before another completed action. It is recognized by the tense signs era and erā in the indicative and isse and issē in the subjunctive.\n\nPluperfect indicative \n\nAs with English, in Latin, the pluperfect indicative is used to assert an action that was completed before another (perfect). Portāveram translates as \"I had carried.\"\n*The tense sign erā is employed before adding the personal endings, with the long ā following the usual rules for shortening before final -m, -t, and -nt.\n\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with esse in the imperfect indicative. Portātus eram is translated as \"I had been carried.\"\n\nPluperfect subjunctive \n\nThe pluperfect subjunctive is to the perfect subjunctive as the imperfect subjunctive is to the present subjunctive. Simply put, it is used with the perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses. Like the imperfect subjunctive, it is translated conditionally independently. Portāvissem is translated as \"I should have carried,\" or \"I would have carried.\"\n*The tense signs isse and issē are used before the personal endings.\n\nAs always, the passive voice uses the perfect passive participle. The imperfect subjunctive of esse is used here. Portātus essem may mean \"I should have been carried,\" or \"I could have been carried,\" in the conditional sense.\n\nFuture perfect \n\nProbably the least used of all the tenses, the future perfect (Latin tempus futūrum exāctum) conveys an action that will have been completed before another action. It is signified by the tense signs erō and eri. The future perfect is the only tense that occurs in a single mood.\n\nFuture perfect indicative \n\nAs said, the future perfect is used to mention an action that will have been completed in futurity before another action. It is often used with the future tense. In simple translation, portāverō means, \"I will have carried,\" or \"I shall have carried.\"\n\n*The tense signs erō and eri or erī are used before the personal endings.\n\nEndings with short -i- (e.g. portāveris, portāverimus, portāveritis) are found in the 2nd singular and 1st and 2nd person plural in some authors, e.g. Terence, Eunuchus 592, but Cicero and Catullus preferred the form with long -i-, e.g. Catullus 5.10 (with Fordyce's note).\n\nAs with all perfective aspect tenses, the perfect passive participle is used in the passive voice. However, the future perfect uses the future indicative of esse as the auxiliary verb. Portātus erō is \"I will have been carried,\" or \"I shall have been carried.\"\n\nNon-finite forms \n\nThe non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:\n\n1st conjugation: portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum – to carry, bring\n2nd conjugation: terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum – to frighten, deter\n3rd conjugation: petō, petere, petīvī, petītum – to seek, attack\n4th conjugation: audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum – to hear, listen (to)\n\nParticiples  \n\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future passive, and future active.\n*The present active participle is declined like a third declension adjective with one ending.\n**In the first and second conjugations, the present active is formed by taking the present stem and adding an –ns. The genitive singular form adds an –ntis, and the thematicals ā and ē are shortened.\n**In the third conjugation, the e of the present stem is lengthened. In the genitive, the ē is short again.\n**In the fourth conjugation, the ī is shortened, and an ē is placed. Of course, this ē is short in the genitive.\n**Puer portāns translates into \"carrying boy.\"\n*The perfect passive participle is declined like a first and second declension adjective.\n**In all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –us (masculine nominative singular).\n**Puer portātus translates into \"carried boy.\"\n*The future active participle is declined like a first and second declension adjective.\n**In all conjugations the –um is removed from the supine, and an –ūrus (masculine nominative singular) is added.\n**Puer portātūrus translates into \"boy going to carry,\" or \"boy who is going to carry.\"\n*The future passive participle is formed by taking the present stem, adding \"-nd-\", and then the adjective ending \"-us, -a, -um\".  Thus \"laudare\" forms \"laudandus\".\n**The literal translation is \"about to be praised\", but this often extends a sense of obligation, thus \"must be praised\".  Thus the \"future passive participle\" is often cross-listed as the \"gerundive\" (see below).\n\nInfinitives  \n\nThere are six infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active and future passive.\n*The present active infinitive is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of Accusativus cum infinitivo, for instance.\n**Portāre means, \"to carry.\"\n*The present passive infinitive is formed by adding a –rī to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, e, is taken from the present stem, and an –ī is added.\n**Portārī translates into \"to be carried.\"\n*The perfect active infinitive is formed by adding an –isse onto the perfect stem.\n**Portāvisse translates into \"to have carried.\"\n*The perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb esse. The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.\n**Portātus esse means, \"to have been carried.\"\n*The future active infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb esse.\n**Portātūrus esse means, \"to be going to carry.\" The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.\n**Esse has two future infinitives: futurus esse and fore (fore is mostly used in a substitute expression for the Future Passive Infinitive)\n*The future passive infinitive uses the supine with the auxiliary verb īrī.\n**Portātum īrī is translated as \"to be going to be carried.\" This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: Omnēs senātōres dīxērunt templum conditum īrī. \"All of the senators said that a temple would be built.\"\n\nThe Future Passive Infinitive was actually not very commonly used (Wheelock's Latin mentions it exists but makes it a point to avoid using it in any practice examples).  In practice, the Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, \"fore ut\" followed by a subjunctive clause.\n\nSupine  \n\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\n*The accusative form ends in a –um, and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like īre \"to go\", venīre \"to come\", etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.\n**Pater vēnit portātum līberōs suōs. – The father came to carry his children.\n*The ablative, which ends in a –ū, is used with the Ablative of Specification.\n**Arma haec facillima portātū erant. – These arms were the easiest to carry.\n\nGerund  \n\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the –ns becomes an –ndus, and the preceding ā or ē is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form portandī can mean \"of carrying\", the dative form portandō can mean \"to carrying\", the accusative form portandum can mean \"carrying\", and the ablative form portandō can mean \"by carrying\", \"in respect to carrying\", etc.\n\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition ad to indicate purpose. For example, paratus ad oppugnandum could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction paratus ad hostes oppugnandos is preferred over paratus ad hostes oppugnandum.\n\nGerundive  \n\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see  above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with an implicit esse, to show obligation.\n\n*Puer portandus \"The boy to be carried\"\n*Oratio laudanda est means \"The speech is to be praised\". In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (dativus auctoris), as in Oratio nobis laudanda est meaning \"The speech is to be praised by us\" or \"We must praise the speech\".\n\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\n\nPeriphrastic conjugations \n\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\n\nActive \n\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of esse. It is translated as \"I am going to carry,\" \"I was going to carry\", etc.\n\nPassive  \n\nThe second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of esse and expresses necessity. It is translated as \"I am to be carried,\" \"I was to be carried\", etc., or as \"I have to (must) be carried,\" \"I had to be carried,\" etc.\n\nPeculiarities \n\nIrregular verbs\n\nThere are a few irregular verbs in Latin that are not grouped into a particular conjugation (such as esse and posse), or deviate slightly from a conjugation (such as ferre, īre, and dare). It consists of the following list and their compounds (such as conferre). Many irregular verbs lack a fourth principal part.\n\nsum esse, fuī, futūrum – to be, exist\npossum, posse, potuī – to be able, can\neō, īre, īvī / īī, ītum – to go\nvolō, velle, voluī – to wish, want\nnōlō, nōlle, nōluī – not to want, refuse\nmālō, mālle, māluī – to prefer\nferō, ferre, tulī, lātum – to bear, endure, carry, bring\nfīō, fierī, factus sum – to become, happen, be made\nedō, ēsse, ēdī, ēsum – to eat, waste\ndō, dare, dedī, datum – to give, bestow\n\nOf these, esse, ferre, and fierī are suppletive, that is, their deviating third and fourth principal parts reflect what was an entirely different verb historically (in Proto-Indo-European).\n\nDeponent and semi-deponent verbs \n\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning.  These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n\n1st conjugation: mīror, mīrārī, mīrātus sum – to admire, wonder\n2nd conjugation: polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum – to promise, offer\n3rd conjugation: loquor, loquī, locūtus sum – to speak, say\n4th conjugation:  mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum – to tell a lie\n\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of loquī, and there are no forms like loquō, loquis, loquit, etc.\n\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n\naudeō, audēre, ausus sum – to dare, venture\n\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n\nEo die quo consueverat intervallo hostes sequitur. – That day he follows the enemy at his usual distance.\n\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, mīrārī changed to mirar(e) by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and audeō changed to osar(e) by taking the participle ausus and making an -ar(e) verb out of it (note that au went to o).\n\nDefective verbs \n\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\n*Some verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect's tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect's tenses' meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb ōdī means, \"I hate.\" These defective verbs' principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:\n\n:ōdī, ōdisse – to hate\n:meminī, meminisse – to remember\n:coepī, coepisse – to have begun\n*A few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.\n\n:Cedo (plur. cette), which means \"Hand it over\" or \"Out with it\" is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.\n\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\n\nAio  \n\nPresent Active Participle: – aiēns, –entis\n\nInquam  \n\nFari  \n\nPresent Active Participle – fāns, fantis\nPresent Active Infinitive – fārī (variant: fārier)\nSupine – (acc.) fātum, (abl.) fātū\nGerund – (gen.) fandī, (dat. and abl.) fandō, no accusative\nGerundive – fandus, –a, –um\n\nThe Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ōdī) survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, odiare).\n\nImpersonal verbs \n\nImpersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems,\" or \"It storms\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:\n\npluit, pluere, pluvit – to rain (it rains)\nningit, ningere, ninxit – to snow (it snows)\noportet, oportēre, oportuit – to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)\nlicet, licēre, licuit – to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])\n\nThe third person forms of esse may also be seen as impersonal when seen from the perspective of English:\n\nNox aestīva calida fuit. – It was a hot, summer night.\nEst eī quī terram colunt. – It is they who till the land.\n\nIrregular future active participles \n\nAs stated, the future active participle is normally formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –ūrus. However, some deviations occur.\n\nAlternative verb forms \n\nSeveral verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):\n*The ending –ris in the passive voice may be –re as in:\n:portābāris → portābāre\n*The ending –ērunt in the perfect may be –ēre (primarily in poetry) as in:\n:portāvērunt → portāvēre\n\nSyncopated verb forms \n\nLike in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and contractions are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:\n*Perfect stems that end in a –v may be contracted when inflected.\n:portāvisse → portāsse\n:portāvistī → portāstī\n:portāverant → portārant\n:portāvisset → portāsset\n*The compounds of noscere (to learn) and movēre (to move, dislodge) can also be contracted.\n:nōvistī → nōstī\n:nōvistis → nōstis\n:commōveram → commōram\n:commōverās → commōrās\n\nSummary of forms \n\nThe four conjugations in the finite forms \n\nNotes \n\n Futūrus esse is sometimes contracted as fore as seen in Caesar's De Bello Gallico.\nThe archaic uncontracted form potesse occurs frequently in Lucretius.\n Form moriri, Ovid, Metamorphoses (poem) 14.215\n Used by Cicero frequently.\n Used personally by Lucretius (2.627): ningunt",

    "aggregatedText" : "Conjugation has two meanings.Merriam-Webster online dictionary [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conjugation \"Conjugation\"]. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. It may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, mood, aspect, voice, or other language-specific factors. \n\nThe second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on.\n\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin coniugātiō, which is a translation of the Greek  ', literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\n\nThe ancient Romans themselves divided their verbs into three conjugations (coniugationes verbis accidunt tres: prima, secunda, tertia \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus)), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an a, an e or an i in it.Donatus [Ars Maior], 10.16. However, modern grammarianse.g. Gildersleeve and Lodge, 3rd edition (1895), §120. usually divide the regular verbs into four different groups according to whether their active present infinitive has the ending -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre (or the passive equivalent of these), for example: (1) amō, amāre \"to love\", (2) videō, vidēre \"to see\", (3) regō, regere \"to rule\" and (4) audiō, audīre \"to hear\". There are also some verbs of mixed conjugation, having some endings like the 3rd and others like the 4th conjugation, for example, capiō, capere \"to capture\" and orior, orīrī \"to arise\".\n\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most important of these is the verb sum, esse \"to be\". There also exist deponent and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as defective verbs (verbs in which some of the tenses are missing).\n \nFor simple verb paradigms, see the appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\n\nProperties  \n\nThe Latin verbs have the following properties:\n* three persons: first, second, and third;\n* two numbers: singular and plural;\n* three tenses: present, past, and future, and two aspects: perfective (finished) and imperfective (unfinished), which combine to form six tenses: present, perfect, imperfect, Pluperfect, future, and future perfect;\n* three finite moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative, of which only the indicative is conjugated fully in all tenses and persons;\n* five non-finite forms: infinitive, gerund, participle, and supine; and gerundive.\n* two voices: active and passive.\n\nPrincipal parts \n\nThere are four conjugations in Latin which define patterns of verb inflection. However the grouping in conjugations is based on the behaviour of the verb in the present system; the stems for other forms cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\n\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are therefore listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs) which allow the reader to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\n# the first person singular of the present indicative active\n# the present infinitive active\n# the first person singular of the perfect indicative active\n# the supine or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs. Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.\n\nFirst conjugation \n\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel ā and can be recognized by the -āre ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n* perfect has the suffix –āvī. The majority of first-conjugation verbs adhere to this pattern, which is considered to be \"regular\", for example:\n** portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum, \"to carry, to bring\";\n** amō, amāre, amāvī, amātum, \"to love, to be fond of\";\n* perfect has the suffix –uī, for example:\n** secō, secāre, secuī, sectum, \"to cut, to divide\";\n** fricō, fricāre, fricuī, frictum, \"to rub\";\n** vetō, vetāre, vetuī, vetitum, \"to forbid, to prohibit\";\n* perfect has the suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:\n** lavō, lavāre, lāvī, lautum, \"to wash, to bathe\";\n** iuvō, iuvāre, iūvī, iūtum, \"to help, to assist\";\n* perfect is reduplicated, for example:\n** stō, stāre, stetī, statum, \"to stand\";\n** dō, dare, dedī, datum, \"to give\"; this verb is irregular, since except in the 2nd singular (dā, dās) the a is short (dăre, dătum, dăbō etc.)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:Gildersleeve & Lodge, Latin Grammar (1895), §163.\n*arbitror, arbitrārī, arbitrātus sum (to think)\n*cōnor, cōnārī, cōnātus sum (to try)\n*cūnctor, cūnctāri, cūnctātus sum (to hesitate)\n\nSecond conjugation \n\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ē, and can be recognized by the -eō ending of the first person present indicative and the -ēre ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n* perfect has the suffix –uī. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\n** terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum (to frighten, to deter)\n** doceō, docēre, docuī, doctum (to teach, to instruct)\n** teneō, tenēre, tenuī, tentum (to hold, to keep)\n* perfect has the suffix –ēvī. Examples:\n** dēleō, dēlēre, dēlēvī, dēlētum (to destroy, to efface)\n** cieō, ciēre, cīvī, citum (to arouse, to stir)\n* perfect has the suffix –sī (which combines with a preceding c or g to –xī). Examples:\n** augeō, augēre, auxī, auctum (to increase, to enlarge)\n** iubeō, iubēre, iussī, iussum (to order, to bid)\n* perfect is reduplicated with –ī. Examples:\n** mordeō, mordēre, momordī, morsum (to bite, to nip)\n** spondeō, spondēre, spopondī, spōnsum (to vow, to promise)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** videō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsum (to see, to notice)\n** foveō, fovēre, fōvī, fōtum (to caress, to cherish)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and no perfect passive participle. Examples:\n** strīdeō, strīdēre, strīdī (to hiss, to creak)\n** ferveō, fervēre, fervī (sometimes fervuī or ferbuī) (to boil, to seethe)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of terreō, but fateor and confiteor have a perfect participle with ss:Gildersleeve & Lodge, Latin Grammar (1895), §164.\n* mereor, merērī, meritus sum (to deserve)\n* polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum (to promise)\n* fateor, fatērī, fassus sum (to confess)\n\nThird conjugation \n\nThe third conjugation is characterized by a short thematic vowel, which alternates between e, i, and u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in –ere in the present active infinitive. There is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:\n* perfect has suffix –sī (–xī when c or h comes at the end of the root). Examples:\n** carpō, carpere, carpsī, carptum (to pluck, to select)\n** trahō, trahere, trāxī, trāctum (to drag, to draw)\n** gerō, gerere, gessī, gestum (to wear, to bear)\n** flectō, flectere, flexī, flexum (to bend, to twist)\n* perfect is reduplicated with suffix –ī. Examples:\n** currō, currere, cucurrī, cursum (to run, to race)\n** caedō, caedere, cecīdī, caesum (to kill, to slay)\n** tangō, tangere, tetigī, tāctum (to touch, to hit)\n** pellō, pellere, pepulī, pulsum (to beat, to drive away)\n* perfect has suffix -vī. Examples:\n** petō, petere, petīvī, petītum (to seek, to attack)\n** linō, linere, līvī, lītum (to smear, to befoul)\n** serō, serere, sēvī, satum (to sow, to plant)\n** terō, terere, trīvī, trītum (to rub, to wear out)\n** sternō, sternere, strāvī, strātus (to spread, to stretch out)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** agō, agere, ēgī, āctum (to do, to drive)\n** legō, legere, lēgī, lēctum (to collect, to read)\n** emō, emere, ēmī, ēmptum (to buy, to purchase)\n** vincō, vincere, vīcī, victum (to conquer, to master)\n** fundō, fundere, fūdī, fūsum (to pour, to utter)\n* perfect has suffix –ī only. Examples:\n** īcō, īcere, īcī, īctum (to strike, to smite)\n** vertō, vertere, vertī, versum (to turn, to alter)\n** vīsō, vīsere, vīsī, vīsum (to visit)\n* perfect has suffix –uī. Examples:\n** metō, metere, messuī, messum (to reap, to harvest)\n** vomō, vomere, vomuī, vomitum (to vomit)\n** colō, colere, coluī, cultum (to cultivate, to till)\n** texō, texere, texuī, textum (to weave, to plait)\n** gignō, gignere, genuī, genitum (to beget, to cause)\n* Present tense indicative first person singular form has suffix with –scō. Examples:\n** nōscō, nōscere, nōvī, nōtum (to get to know, to learn)\n** adolēscō, adolēscere, adolēvī (to grow up, to mature)\n** flōrēscō, flōrēscere, flōruī (to begin to flourish, to blossom)\n** haerēscō, haerēscere, haesī, haesum (to adhere, to stick)\n** pāscō, pāscere, pāvī, pāstum (to feed upon, to feed (an animal))\n\nDeponent verbs in the 3rd conjugation include the following:\n*lābor, lābī, lāpsus sum (to glide)\n*loquor, loquī, locūtus sum (to speak)\n*oblīvīscor, oblīvīscī, oblītus sum (to forget)\n*sequor, sequī, secūtus sum (to follow)\n*ūtor, ūtī, ūsus sum (to use)\n\nThird conjugation –iō verbs\n\nIntermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the third-conjugation verbs with suffix –iō. These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. Some examples are:\n*capiō, capere, cēpī, captum (to take, capture)\n*faciō, facere, fēcī, factum (to do, to make)\n*rapiō, rapere, rapuī, raptum (to plunder, take up, seize)\n*cupiō, cupere, cupīvī, cupītum (to desire, long for)\n\nDeponent verbs in this group include:\n*morior, morī, mortuus sum (to die)\n*patior, patī, passus sum (to suffer, to allow)\n*aggredior, aggredī, aggressus sum (to attack)\n\nThey resemble the fourth conjugation in the following parts of the verb:\n\nPresent indicative (first person singular, third person plural): capiō, capiunt.\nIndicative imperfect: capiēbam, capiēbāmus.\nIndicative future: capiam, capiēmus.\nSubjunctive present: capiam, capiāmus\nImperative future (third person plural): capiuntō\nPresent Active Participle: capiēns, -entis\nGerund: capiendī, capiendum (also capiundī)\nGerundive: capiendus, –a, –um (also capiundus)\n\nFourth conjugation \n\nThe fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel ī and can be recognized by the –īre ending of the present active infinitive. Principal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:\n* perfect has suffix –vī. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\n** audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum (to hear, listen (to))\n** mūniō, mūnīre, mūnīvī, mūnītum (to fortify, to build)\n* perfect has suffix –uī. Examples:\n** aperiō, aperīre, aperuī, apertum (to open, to uncover)\n* perfect has suffix –sī (-xī when c comes at the end of the root). Examples:\n** saepiō, saepīre, saepsī, saeptum (to surround, to enclose)\n** sanciō, sancīre, sānxī, sānctum (to confirm, to ratify)\n** sentiō, sentīre, sēnsī, sēnsum (to feel, to perceive)\n* perfect has suffix –ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n** veniō, venīre, vēnī, ventum (to come, to arrive)\n\nDeponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:Gildersleeve & Lodge Latin Grammar (1985), §166.\n*assentior, assentīrī, assēnsus sum (to assent)\n*largior, largīrī, largītus sum (to bestow)\n*mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum (to tell a lie)\n*mētior, mētīrī, mēnsus sum (to measure)\n*sortior, sortīrī, sortītus sum (to cast lots)\n\nThe verb orior, orīrī, ortus sum (to arise) is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense oritur and imperfect subjunctive orerer, have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound adorior (to rise up, attack) is entirely 4th conjugation.\n\nPersonal endings \n\nPersonal endings are used in all tenses. The present, imperfect, future, pluperfect and future perfect use the same personal endings in the active voice. However, the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect do not have personal endings in the passive voice. These are formed by a participle and a form of esse (to be). For example, the perfect passive 1st person singular form of the verb amāre (to love) is amatus sum, using the participle and sum rather than the perfect stem amav- and some form of -ir. The perfect uses its own personal endings in the active voice, which are shown in the chart below.\n\nImperfective aspect tenses \n\nThe tenses of the imperfective aspect are present, imperfect, and future tense. Verb forms in the imperfective aspect express an action that has (or had) not been completed. Consider for concreteness the following verbs:\n* the first conjugation verb portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum (to carry, to bring)\n* the second conjugation verb terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum (to frighten, to deter)\n* the third conjugation verb petō, petere, petīvī, petītum (to seek, to attack)\n* the fourth conjugation verb audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum (to hear, to listen (to))\n\nIn all the conjugations except for the third conjugation, the –re is removed from the second principal part (for example, portāre without the suffix –re becomes portā–) to form the present stem, which is used for all of the tenses in the imperfective aspect. In the third conjugation, the –ō ending of the present indicative is dropped in order to form the present stem (for example, the present indicative form of regere is regō, and without the -ō it is the present stem, reg–). Occasionally, the terminating vowel of the stem is lengthened and/or shortened, and sometimes completely changed. This is often true both in the third conjugation and in the subjunctive mood of all conjugations.\n\nPresent tense \n\nThe present tense (Latin tempus praesēns) is used to show an uncompleted action that happens in the current time. The present tense does not have a tense sign. Instead, the personal endings are added to the bare present stem. However, in this tense the thematic vowel, most notably the ě in the third conjugation, changes the most frequently.\n\nPresent indicative \n\nThe present indicative expresses general truths, facts, demands and desires. Most commonly, a verb like portō can be translated as \"I carry,\" \"I do carry,\" or \"I am carrying\". In all but the third conjugation, only the thematical vowel of the stem is used. In the third conjugation, the e is only used in the second person singular in the passive for a less difficult pronunciation. Otherwise, it becomes either an i or u. The first person singular of the indicative active present is the first principal part. All end in –ō.\n\nAdd the passive endings to form the passive voice. The passive portor can be translated as \"I am carried,\" or \"I am being carried\".\n\nNotice that in the second person singular of petere, the thematic vowel is e (peteris, not petiris).\n\nPresent subjunctive \n\nThe present subjunctive may be used to assert many things. In general, in independent sentences, it is translated hortatorily (only in the third person plural), jussively and optatively. Portem can be translated as \"Let me carry.\" or \"May I carry.\" Portēmus can be \"Let us carry\".\n\nSome alterations have occurred in the vowels from the indicative and subjunctive.\n*The first conjugation now uses an e and an ē.\n*The second conjugation uses ea and eā.\n*The third conjugation uses a or ā.\n*The fourth conjugation uses ia or iā.\n\n\"Let's beat that giant\", \"Defeat all liars\", or \"She wears a diamond/tiara\" are helpful mnemonics for remembering this.  First conjugation verbs have an \"e\" in their stem (we), second conjugation verbs have an \"-ea\" (eat), third conjugation verbs have an \"a\" (caviar), and fourths have an \"ia\" (caviar).\n\nLike the indicative, active personal endings may be replaced by passive personal endings. Porter can be translated as \"Let me be carried\" or \"May I be carried.\" Hortatorily, Portēmur can be \"Let us be carried\".\n\nPresent imperative \n\nThe present imperative conveys commands, pleas and recommendations. Portā can be translated as \"(You) Carry\" or simply, \"Carry\". The imperative present occurs only in the second person.\n*The second person singular in the active voice uses only the bare stem, and does not add an imperative ending.\n\nThe imperative present of the passive voice is rarely used, except in the case of deponent verbs, whose passive forms carry active meaning. Portāminī can be translated as \"(You) Be carried\".  The deponent sequiminī, on the other hand, means \"(You) Follow!\".\n*The singular uses the alternate form of the present passive indicative (which looks like the present active infinitive) and the plural uses the present passive indicative form of the second person plural.\n\nImperfect \n\nThe imperfect (Latin tempus praeteritum imperfectum) indicates a perpetual, but incomplete action in the past. It is recognized by the tense signs bă and bā in the indicative, and re and rē in the subjunctive.\n\nImperfect indicative \n\nThe imperfect indicative simply expresses an action in the past that was not completed. Portābam can be translated to mean, \"I was carrying,\" \"I carried,\" or \"I used to carry\".\n*In the indicative, the imperfect employs its tense signs ba and bā before personal endings are added.\n\nAs with the present tense, active personal endings are taken off, and passive personal endings are put in their place. Portābar can be translated as \"I was being carried,\" \"I kept being carried,\" or \"I used to be carried\".\n\nImperfect subjunctive \n\nIn the subjunctive, the imperfect is quite important, especially in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is largely translated conditionally. Portārem can mean, \"I should carry,\" or \"I would carry\".\n*Unlike the indicative, the subjunctive does not modify the thematic vowel. The third conjugation's thematical remains short as an e, and the fourth conjugation does not use an iē before the imperfect signs. It keeps its ī.\n*In the subjunctive, the imperfect employs its tense signs re and rē before personal endings.\n*The verb esse (to be) has two imperfect subjunctives: one using the present infinitive (essem, esses, esset, essemus, essetis, essent) and one using the future infinitive (forem, fores, foret, foremus, foretis, forent).\n\nAs with the indicative subjunctive, active endings are removed, and passive endings are added. Portārer may be translated as \"I should be carried,\" or \"I would be carried.\"\n\nFuture tense \n\nThe future tense (Latin tempus futūrum simplex) expresses an uncompleted action in the future. It is recognized by its tense signs bō, bi, bu, a and ē in the indicative and the vowel ō in the imperative mood.\n\nFuture indicative \n\nThe future tense always refers to an incomplete action. In addition, the future tense is stricter in usage temporally in Latin than it is in English. Standing alone, portābō can mean, \"I shall carry,\" or \"I will carry.\"\n*The first and second conjugations use bō, bi and bu as signs for the future indicative.\n*The third and fourth conjugations replace their thematic vowels with a, ě and ē. The fourth conjugation inserts an ǐ before the a, e and ē.\n\nAs with all imperfective system tenses, active personal endings are removed, and passive personal endings are put on. Portābor translates as, \"I shall be carried.\"\n\nNotice that the penultimate vowel in the second person singular of portāre and terrēre is e, not i (portāberis and terrēberis, instead of the expected portābiris and terrēbiris).\n\nFuture imperative \n\nThe future imperative was a formal form of the imperative; by the classical period, it was chiefly used in legal documents, though it retained some currency in distinct reference to future time.Allen, Joseph and James Greenough. Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar. New York: Ginn & Co., 1888. 282.   A few irregular or defective verbs (meminisse 'remember') used this form as their only imperative.\n\nPortātō can be translated as \"You shall carry\".\n*As mentioned previously, the vowel ō is used as a sign of the future imperative.\n\nThe ending -r marks the passive voice in the future imperative. The second person plural is absent here. Portātor translates as \"You shall be carried.\"\n\nPerfective aspect tenses \n\nThe tenses of the perfective aspect, which are the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses, are used to express actions that have been, had been, or will have been completed. The verbs used for explanation are:\n\n1st conjugation: portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum – to carry, bring\n2nd conjugation: terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum – to frighten, deter\n3rd conjugation: petō, petere, petīvī, petītum – to seek, attack\n4th conjugation: audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum – to hear, listen (to)\n\nTo find the stem for the third principal part in all of the conjugations, the –ī is removed from it. For example, from portāvī, portāv is formed. This is the perfect stem, and it is used for all of the tenses in the perfective aspect. The perfective aspect verbs also use the perfect passive participle in the passive voice. See below to see how it is formed. Along with these participles, the verb esse, which means, \"to be\", is used.\n\nUnlike the imperfective aspect, inflection does not deviate from conjugation to conjugation.\n\nPerfect \n\nThe perfect (Latin tempus praeteritum perfectum) refers to an action completed in the past. Tense signs are only used in this tense with the indicative. The tense signs of the subjunctive are eri and erī.\n\nPerfect indicative \n\nThe indicative perfect expresses a finished action in the past. If the action were not finished, but still lies in the past, one would use the imperfect. Portāvī is translated as \"I carried,\" \"I did carry,\" or \"I have carried.\"\n*As aforementioned, the indicative perfect in the active voice has its special personal endings.\n\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with the auxiliary verb esse. It uses the present indicative form of esse. Portātus sum translates as \"I was carried,\" or \"I have been carried.\"\n\nNote the participle changes from singular to plural when the subject changes respectively. Treat the participle as an adjective with only nominative singular and plural forms. The participle must also be declined for gender. This can be done by removing the -us on the participle and adding -us, -a, -um with the plural being: -i -ae -a. -us, -i is Masculine, -a, -ae is Feminine, and -um, -a is neuter.\n\nPerfect subjunctive \n\nLike the imperfect subjunctive, the perfect subjunctive is largely used in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is usually translated as the potential subjunctive. By itself, portāverim translates as \"I may have carried.\"\n*The tense signs eri and erī are used before the personal endings are added.\n\nThe passive voice uses the perfect passive participle with the subjunctive present forms of esse. Portātus sim means, \"I may have been carried.\"\n\nPluperfect \n\nThe pluperfect (Latin tempus praeteritum plūsquamperfectum) expresses an action which was completed before another completed action. It is recognized by the tense signs era and erā in the indicative and isse and issē in the subjunctive.\n\nPluperfect indicative \n\nAs with English, in Latin, the pluperfect indicative is used to assert an action that was completed before another (perfect). Portāveram translates as \"I had carried.\"\n*The tense sign erā is employed before adding the personal endings, with the long ā following the usual rules for shortening before final -m, -t, and -nt.\n\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with esse in the imperfect indicative. Portātus eram is translated as \"I had been carried.\"\n\nPluperfect subjunctive \n\nThe pluperfect subjunctive is to the perfect subjunctive as the imperfect subjunctive is to the present subjunctive. Simply put, it is used with the perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses. Like the imperfect subjunctive, it is translated conditionally independently. Portāvissem is translated as \"I should have carried,\" or \"I would have carried.\"\n*The tense signs isse and issē are used before the personal endings.\n\nAs always, the passive voice uses the perfect passive participle. The imperfect subjunctive of esse is used here. Portātus essem may mean \"I should have been carried,\" or \"I could have been carried,\" in the conditional sense.\n\nFuture perfect \n\nProbably the least used of all the tenses, the future perfect (Latin tempus futūrum exāctum) conveys an action that will have been completed before another action. It is signified by the tense signs erō and eri. The future perfect is the only tense that occurs in a single mood.\n\nFuture perfect indicative \n\nAs said, the future perfect is used to mention an action that will have been completed in futurity before another action. It is often used with the future tense. In simple translation, portāverō means, \"I will have carried,\" or \"I shall have carried.\"\n\n*The tense signs erō and eri or erī are used before the personal endings.\n\nEndings with short -i- (e.g. portāveris, portāverimus, portāveritis) are found in the 2nd singular and 1st and 2nd person plural in some authors, e.g. Terence, Eunuchus 592, but Cicero and Catullus preferred the form with long -i-, e.g. Catullus 5.10 (with Fordyce's note).\n\nAs with all perfective aspect tenses, the perfect passive participle is used in the passive voice. However, the future perfect uses the future indicative of esse as the auxiliary verb. Portātus erō is \"I will have been carried,\" or \"I shall have been carried.\"\n\nNon-finite forms \n\nThe non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:\n\n1st conjugation: portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum – to carry, bring\n2nd conjugation: terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum – to frighten, deter\n3rd conjugation: petō, petere, petīvī, petītum – to seek, attack\n4th conjugation: audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum – to hear, listen (to)\n\nParticiples  \n\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future passive, and future active.\n*The present active participle is declined like a third declension adjective with one ending.\n**In the first and second conjugations, the present active is formed by taking the present stem and adding an –ns. The genitive singular form adds an –ntis, and the thematicals ā and ē are shortened.\n**In the third conjugation, the e of the present stem is lengthened. In the genitive, the ē is short again.\n**In the fourth conjugation, the ī is shortened, and an ē is placed. Of course, this ē is short in the genitive.\n**Puer portāns translates into \"carrying boy.\"\n*The perfect passive participle is declined like a first and second declension adjective.\n**In all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –us (masculine nominative singular).\n**Puer portātus translates into \"carried boy.\"\n*The future active participle is declined like a first and second declension adjective.\n**In all conjugations the –um is removed from the supine, and an –ūrus (masculine nominative singular) is added.\n**Puer portātūrus translates into \"boy going to carry,\" or \"boy who is going to carry.\"\n*The future passive participle is formed by taking the present stem, adding \"-nd-\", and then the adjective ending \"-us, -a, -um\".  Thus \"laudare\" forms \"laudandus\".\n**The literal translation is \"about to be praised\", but this often extends a sense of obligation, thus \"must be praised\".  Thus the \"future passive participle\" is often cross-listed as the \"gerundive\" (see below).\n\nInfinitives  \n\nThere are six infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active and future passive.\n*The present active infinitive is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of Accusativus cum infinitivo, for instance.\n**Portāre means, \"to carry.\"\n*The present passive infinitive is formed by adding a –rī to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, e, is taken from the present stem, and an –ī is added.\n**Portārī translates into \"to be carried.\"\n*The perfect active infinitive is formed by adding an –isse onto the perfect stem.\n**Portāvisse translates into \"to have carried.\"\n*The perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb esse. The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.\n**Portātus esse means, \"to have been carried.\"\n*The future active infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb esse.\n**Portātūrus esse means, \"to be going to carry.\" The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.\n**Esse has two future infinitives: futurus esse and fore (fore is mostly used in a substitute expression for the Future Passive Infinitive)\n*The future passive infinitive uses the supine with the auxiliary verb īrī.\n**Portātum īrī is translated as \"to be going to be carried.\" This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: Omnēs senātōres dīxērunt templum conditum īrī. \"All of the senators said that a temple would be built.\"\n\nThe Future Passive Infinitive was actually not very commonly used (Wheelock's Latin mentions it exists but makes it a point to avoid using it in any practice examples).  In practice, the Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, \"fore ut\" followed by a subjunctive clause.\n\nSupine  \n\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\n*The accusative form ends in a –um, and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like īre \"to go\", venīre \"to come\", etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.\n**Pater vēnit portātum līberōs suōs. – The father came to carry his children.\n*The ablative, which ends in a –ū, is used with the Ablative of Specification.\n**Arma haec facillima portātū erant. – These arms were the easiest to carry.\n\nGerund  \n\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the –ns becomes an –ndus, and the preceding ā or ē is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form portandī can mean \"of carrying\", the dative form portandō can mean \"to carrying\", the accusative form portandum can mean \"carrying\", and the ablative form portandō can mean \"by carrying\", \"in respect to carrying\", etc.\n\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition ad to indicate purpose. For example, paratus ad oppugnandum could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction paratus ad hostes oppugnandos is preferred over paratus ad hostes oppugnandum.\n\nGerundive  \n\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see  above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with an implicit esse, to show obligation.\n\n*Puer portandus \"The boy to be carried\"\n*Oratio laudanda est means \"The speech is to be praised\". In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (dativus auctoris), as in Oratio nobis laudanda est meaning \"The speech is to be praised by us\" or \"We must praise the speech\".\n\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\n\nPeriphrastic conjugations \n\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\n\nActive \n\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of esse. It is translated as \"I am going to carry,\" \"I was going to carry\", etc.\n\nPassive  \n\nThe second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of esse and expresses necessity. It is translated as \"I am to be carried,\" \"I was to be carried\", etc., or as \"I have to (must) be carried,\" \"I had to be carried,\" etc.\n\nPeculiarities \n\nIrregular verbs\n\nThere are a few irregular verbs in Latin that are not grouped into a particular conjugation (such as esse and posse), or deviate slightly from a conjugation (such as ferre, īre, and dare). It consists of the following list and their compounds (such as conferre). Many irregular verbs lack a fourth principal part.\n\nsum esse, fuī, futūrum – to be, exist\npossum, posse, potuī – to be able, can\neō, īre, īvī / īī, ītum – to go\nvolō, velle, voluī – to wish, want\nnōlō, nōlle, nōluī – not to want, refuse\nmālō, mālle, māluī – to prefer\nferō, ferre, tulī, lātum – to bear, endure, carry, bring\nfīō, fierī, factus sum – to become, happen, be made\nedō, ēsse, ēdī, ēsum – to eat, waste\ndō, dare, dedī, datum – to give, bestow\n\nOf these, esse, ferre, and fierī are suppletive, that is, their deviating third and fourth principal parts reflect what was an entirely different verb historically (in Proto-Indo-European).\n\nDeponent and semi-deponent verbs \n\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning.  These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n\n1st conjugation: mīror, mīrārī, mīrātus sum – to admire, wonder\n2nd conjugation: polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum – to promise, offer\n3rd conjugation: loquor, loquī, locūtus sum – to speak, say\n4th conjugation:  mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum – to tell a lie\n\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of loquī, and there are no forms like loquō, loquis, loquit, etc.\n\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n\naudeō, audēre, ausus sum – to dare, venture\n\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n\nEo die quo consueverat intervallo hostes sequitur. – That day he follows the enemy at his usual distance.\n\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, mīrārī changed to mirar(e) by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and audeō changed to osar(e) by taking the participle ausus and making an -ar(e) verb out of it (note that au went to o).\n\nDefective verbs \n\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\n*Some verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect's tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect's tenses' meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb ōdī means, \"I hate.\" These defective verbs' principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:\n\n:ōdī, ōdisse – to hate\n:meminī, meminisse – to remember\n:coepī, coepisse – to have begun\n*A few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.\n\n:Cedo (plur. cette), which means \"Hand it over\" or \"Out with it\" is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.\n\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\n\nAio  \n\nPresent Active Participle: – aiēns, –entis\n\nInquam  \n\nFari  \n\nPresent Active Participle – fāns, fantis\nPresent Active Infinitive – fārī (variant: fārier)\nSupine – (acc.) fātum, (abl.) fātū\nGerund – (gen.) fandī, (dat. and abl.) fandō, no accusative\nGerundive – fandus, –a, –um\n\nThe Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ōdī) survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, odiare).\n\nImpersonal verbs \n\nImpersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems,\" or \"It storms\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:\n\npluit, pluere, pluvit – to rain (it rains)\nningit, ningere, ninxit – to snow (it snows)\noportet, oportēre, oportuit – to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)\nlicet, licēre, licuit – to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])\n\nThe third person forms of esse may also be seen as impersonal when seen from the perspective of English:\n\nNox aestīva calida fuit. – It was a hot, summer night.\nEst eī quī terram colunt. – It is they who till the land.\n\nIrregular future active participles \n\nAs stated, the future active participle is normally formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –ūrus. However, some deviations occur.\n\nAlternative verb forms \n\nSeveral verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):\n*The ending –ris in the passive voice may be –re as in:\n:portābāris → portābāre\n*The ending –ērunt in the perfect may be –ēre (primarily in poetry) as in:\n:portāvērunt → portāvēre\n\nSyncopated verb forms \n\nLike in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and contractions are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:\n*Perfect stems that end in a –v may be contracted when inflected.\n:portāvisse → portāsse\n:portāvistī → portāstī\n:portāverant → portārant\n:portāvisset → portāsset\n*The compounds of noscere (to learn) and movēre (to move, dislodge) can also be contracted.\n:nōvistī → nōstī\n:nōvistis → nōstis\n:commōveram → commōram\n:commōverās → commōrās\n\nSummary of forms \n\nThe four conjugations in the finite forms \n\nNotes \n\n Futūrus esse is sometimes contracted as fore as seen in Caesar's De Bello Gallico.\nThe archaic uncontracted form potesse occurs frequently in Lucretius.\n Form moriri, Ovid, Metamorphoses (poem) 14.215\n Used by Cicero frequently.\n Used personally by Lucretius (2.627): ningunt.
