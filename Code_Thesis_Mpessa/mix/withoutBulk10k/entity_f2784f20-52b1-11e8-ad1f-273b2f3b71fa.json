  "textBody" : "European United Left–Nordic Green Left (Gauche unitaire européenne, GUE-NGL) is a left-wing political group in the European Parliament, established in 1995. The group comprises political parties of  socialist and communist orientation.\n\nPosition\n\nAccording to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present European Union political structure, but committed to integration. That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union: the total change of institutions to make them \"fully democratic\"; breaking with \"neo-liberal monetarist policies\"; and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and \"strengthen the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\" (OSCE).\n\nThe group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as \"insiders\" within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision, and as \"outsiders\" by its willingness to seek \"another Union\" which would abolish the Maastricht Treaty.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe GUE/NGL is a confederal group: it is composed of MEPs from national parties. Those national parties must share common political objectives with the group, as specified in the group's constituent declaration. Nevertheless, those national parties, not the group, retain control of their MEPs. Thus, the Group may be divided on certain issues.\n\nMembers of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions.

The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs. The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish Left Alliance, Swedish Left Party, the Danish Socialist People's Party, United Left of Spain (including the Spanish Communist Party), Synaspismós of Greece, the French Communist Party, Portuguese Communist Party, the Communist Party of Greece, and the Communist Refoundation Party of Italy.\n\nIn 1999, the German Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the Greek Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI) joined as full members, while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance LO-LCR joined as associate members.\n\nIn 2002, four MEPs from the French Citizen and Republican Movement also joined the group.\n\nIn 2004, no MEPs were elected from LO-LCR, and DIKKI—which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution—did not put forward candidates.
