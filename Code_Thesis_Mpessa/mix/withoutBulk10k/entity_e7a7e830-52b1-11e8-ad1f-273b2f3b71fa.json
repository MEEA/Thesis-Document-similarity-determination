  "textBody" : "In geometry, a dodecahedron (Greek , from  dōdeka \"twelve\" +  hédra \"base\", \"seat\" or \"face\") is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces. The most familiar dodecahedron is the regular dodecahedron, which is a Platonic solid. There are also three regular star dodecahedra, which are constructed as stellations of the convex form. All of these have icosahedral symmetry, order 120.\n\nThe pyritohedron is an irregular pentagonal dodecahedron, having the same topology as the regular one but pyritohedral symmetry while the tetartoid has tetrahedral symmetry. The rhombic dodecahedron, seen as a limiting case of the pyritohedron, has octahedral symmetry. The elongated dodecahedron and trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron variations, along with the rhombic dodecahedra, are space-filling. There are a large number of other dodecahedra.\n\nPentagonal dodecahedron\n\nThe convex regular dodecahedron is one of the five regular Platonic solids and can be represented by its Schläfli symbol {5, 3}.\n\nThe dual polyhedron is the regular icosahedron {3, 5}, having five equilateral triangles around each vertex.\n\nIn crystallography, two important dodecahedra can occur as crystal forms in some symmetry classes of the cubic crystal system that are topologically equivalent to the regular dodecahedron but less symmetrical: the pyritohedron with pyritohedral symmetry, and the tetartoid with tetrahedral symmetry:\n\nPyritohedron \n\nA pyritohedron is a dodecahedron with pyritohedral (Th) symmetry. Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axes. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of rotational symmetry are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the  pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral pyrite, and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular Platonic solid form. Note that the true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for quasicrystals with icosahedral symmetry, which includes true fivefold rotation axes.\n\nCrystal pyrite \n\nIts name comes from one of the two common crystal habits shown by pyrite, the other one being the cube.\n\nCartesian coordinates\n\nThe coordinates of the eight vertices of the original cube are:\n(±1, ±1, ±1)\n\nThe coordinates of the 12 vertices of the cross-edges are:\n(0, ±(1 + h), ±(1 − h2))\n(±(1 + h), ±(1 − h2), 0)\n(±(1 − h2), 0, ±(1 + h))\n\nwhere h is the height of the wedge-shaped \"roof\" above the faces of the cube. When h  1, the six cross-edges degenerate to points and a  rhombic dodecahedron is formed. When h \n 0, the cross-edges are absorbed in the facets of the cube, and the pyritohedron reduces to a cube. When h = , the inverse of the golden ratio, the result is a regular dodecahedron.\n\nA reflected pyritohedron is made by swapping the nonzero coordinates above. The two pyritohedra can be superimposed to give the compound of two dodecahedra as seen in the image here.\n\nGeometric freedom \n\nThe pyritohedron has a geometric degree of freedom with limiting cases of a cubic convex hull at one limit of colinear edges, and a rhombic dodecahedron as the other limit as 6 edges are degenerated to length zero. The regular dodecahedron represents a special intermediate case where all edges and angles are equal.\n\nTetartoid \n\nA tetartoid (also tetragonal pentagonal dodecahedron, pentagon-tritetrahedron, and tetrahedric pentagon dodecahedron) is a dodecahedron with chiral tetrahedral symmetry (T). Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry.Dutch, Steve.

In Conway polyhedron notation it can be seen as gT, a gyro tetrahedron.\n\nDual of triangular gyrobianticupola \n\nA lower symmetry form of the regular dodecahedron can be constructed as the dual of a polyhedra constructed from two triangular anticupola connected base-to-base, called a triangular gyrobianticupola. It has D3d symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.\nRhombic dodecahedron\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron is a zonohedron with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the quasiregular cuboctahedron (an Archimedean solid) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron can be seen as a degenerate pyritohedron where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron has several stellations, the first of which is also a parallelohedral spacefiller.\n\nAnother important rhombic dodecahedron, the Bilinski dodecahedron, has twelve faces congruent to those of the rhombic triacontahedron, i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the golden ratio. It is also a zonohedron and was described by Bilinski in 1960.Hafner, I. and Zitko, T. [http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/hafner2/IntrodRhombic.html Introduction to golden rhombic polyhedra]. Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. This figure is another spacefiller, and can also occur in non-periodic spacefillings along with the rhombic triacontahedron, the rhombic icosahedron and rhombic hexahedra.\n\nOther dodecahedra\n\nThere are 6,384,634 topologically distinct convex dodecahedra, excluding mirror images—the number of vertices ranges from 8 to 20.[http://www.numericana.com/data/polycount.htm Counting polyhedra].
