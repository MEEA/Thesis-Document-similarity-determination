The proportion of children between the ages of 0 and 14 in 2010 was 39.2%, 57.9% was between 15 and 64 years of age, while 2.9% was 65 years or older\n.\n\nStructure of the population (DHS 2011) (Males 9 043, Females 9 702 = 18 745) :\n\nVital statistics \n\nRegistration of vital events is in Equatorial Guinea not complete. The Population Departement of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.\n\nFertility and births\n\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\n\nFertility data as of 2011 (DHS Program):\n\nEthnic groups \n\nPeoples considered as natives\n \nThe majority of the people of Equatorial Guinea are of Bantu origin. The largest ethnic group, the Fang, are indigenous to the mainland, but substantial migration to Bioko Island has resulted in Fang dominance over the earlier Bubi inhabitants. The Fang constitute 80% of the population and are themselves divided into 67 clans. Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects are mutually unintelligible. The Bubi, who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island.\n\nIn addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, collectively referred to as Ndowe or \"Playeros\" (\"Beach People\" in Spanish): Combes, Bujebas, Balengues and Bengas on the mainland and small islands and a Fernandino community of Krio descended people on Bioko. Together, these groups compose 5% of the population.\n\nTwo small groups of Pygmies also inhabit the country, the Beyele and the Bokuign,[http://www.guinea-ecuatorial.info/historia.html]  the former being located in the Altos de Nsork region.[http://www.observatoire-comifac.net/docs/edf2006/EN/State_of_the_Forest_2006-03.pdf Monte Alén-Monts de Cristal Landscape: Ethnic groups]. In: Observatoire des Fôrets de l'Afrique Centrale (2006). The Forests of the Congo Basin. The State of the Forest 2006, p. 117. Their population is dwindling, them being subjected to heavy pressure from their neighbours, who don't even consider them as human.\n\nRecently immigrated peoples \n\nSome Europeans (largely of Spanish or Portuguese descent) – among them mixed with African ethnicity – also live in the nation. Most Spaniards left after independence.There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring Cameroon, Nigeria, and Gabon. Equatorial Guinea received Asians and black Africans from other countries as workers on cocoa and coffee plantations.In the late 20th century, Equatorial Guinea became home to more than 80,000 Hispanics from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish speaking nations in the Americas.Other black Africans came from Liberia, Angola, and Mozambique, and Asians are mostly Chinese with small numbers of Indians. Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including British, French and Germans. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of dictatorship of Francisco Macías Nguema. Some of its communities also live in Brazil, United States, Portugal, and France.\n\nLanguages \n\nSpanish, French and Portuguese are the official languages and spoken as second languages. Spanish is the language of education, and for this reason a majority of the population (about 88%) can speak it, though only about 10–15% have a high competence in the language.[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_06-07/pdf/paises_08.pdf Gloria Nistal Rosique: El caso del español en Guinea Ecuatorial] (in Spanish) Annobonese speak a Portuguese Creole, named Annobonese, as their first language. Asians and other Europeans speak their own languages. Foreign Africans speak their native languages and their nation's official languages—English and Igbo for Nigerians; English for Cameroonians and Liberians; French for Cameroonians and Gabonese; and Portuguese for Angolans and Mozambicans. The latter was made an official language since July 13, 2007. 82% of first foreign language learners choose the French language and 18% the English language.[http://asp.zone-secure.net/v2/index.jsp?id=7259/9906/54502]  The Roman Catholic Church has greatly influenced both religion and education.\n\nLanguages of traditional names\n\nEquatoguineans tend to have both a Spanish first name and an African first and last name. When written, the Spanish and African first names are followed by the father's first name (which becomes the principal surname) and the mother's first name. Thus people may have up to four names, with a different surname for each generation.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nnote: 2002 census results claim 1,015,000 residents, although this most likely was inflated in anticipation for the December election.\n\nPopulation growth rate:\n2.703% (2010 est.)\n\nSex ratio:\nat birth:\n1.03 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years:\n1.01 male(s)/female\n15–64 years:\n0.93 male(s)/female\n65 years and over:\n0.77 male(s)/female\ntotal population:\n0.96 male(s)/female (2006 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population:\n61.61 years\nmale:\n60.71 years\nfemale:\n62.54 years (2010 est.)\n\nReligions:\nnominally Christian and predominantly Roman Catholic, pagan practices\n\nLiteracy:\ndefinition:\nage 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population:\n87%\nmale:\n93.4%\nfemale:\n80.5% (2000 est.)",
