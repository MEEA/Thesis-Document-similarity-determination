  "textBody" : "The Branch Davidians (also known as \"The Branch\") are a religious cult that originated in 1955 from a schism among the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, a reform movement that began as an offshoot from the Seventh-day Adventist Church around 1930. The group gained notoriety in 1993, when federal authorities laid a siege on a compound controlled by a group under David Koresh which abandoned many Davidian teachings and became a new religious movement with him as its self-proclaimed final prophet.\n\nSome of those who accepted the reform message had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because their teachings were seen as heretical by fellow Adventists. Today, the original Davidian (Shepherd's Rod) and the Branch Davidian are two different and distinct groups. The doctrinal beliefs differ on major teachings such as the Holy Spirit and his nature, and the feast days and their requirements. Both groups have disputed the relevance of the other's spiritual authority based on the proceedings following Victor Houteff's death. From its inception in 1930, the reform movement believed themselves to be living in a time when Biblical prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's Second Coming.\n\nIn 1993, the ATF and Texas National Guard raided one of the properties belonging to a Branch Davidian group centered around David Koresh for suspected weapons violations. While climbing a ladder, an officer accidentally shot himself in the leg, which began a two-hour firefight in which four ATF agents were killed; this was followed by a standoff with the FBI that lasted for 51 days. The siege ended with a raid that resulted in the deaths of Koresh and 82 of his followers.\n\nToday, most of the remaining Branch Davidians are organized into a legally recognized denomination: The BRANCH, The Lord Our Righteousness.\n\nEarly history \n\nIn 1929, Victor Houteff, a Bulgarian immigrant and a Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath School teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church. He presented his views in a book, The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000—A Call for Reformation. The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's views as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and disfellowshipped Houteff and his followers.\n\nIn 1935, Houteff established his headquarters to the west of Waco, Texas and his group became known as The Shepherd's Rod Seventh-day Adventists. In 1942 he renamed the group to the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, 'Davidian' indicating the belief in the restoration of the Davidic Kingdom of Israel. Following Houteff's death in 1955, the segment of the group loyal to Houteff continued as the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, led by his wife Florence. Convinced of an imminent apocalypse and purported by Florence Houteff's time setting, which was not found in the original writings of her husband Victor, Florence Houteff and her council gathered hundreds of faithful followers together at their Mount Carmel Centre near Waco in 1959, for the fulfillment of Ezekiel 9.\n\nFollowing this disappointment, Benjamin Roden formed another group called the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists and succeeded in taking control of Mount Carmel. This name is an allusion to the anointed 'Branch' (mentioned in Zechariah 3:8; 6:12). When Benjamin Roden died in 1978, he was succeeded by his wife Lois Roden. After Lois Roden died, a bitter power struggle ensued between Lois Roden's son George Roden and her lover and designated successor David Koresh (then still using his birth name of Vernon Howell), eventually won by Koresh.\n\nRise of Koresh\n\nDavid Koresh's arrival on the Waco compound in 1981 was well received by nearly everyone at the Davidian commune. Koresh had an affair with the then-prophetess of the Branch Davidians Lois Roden, while he was in his late 20s and she was in her late 60s. Koresh wanted a child with her, who, according to his understanding, would be the Chosen One. When she died, her son George Roden inherited the position of prophet and leader of the commune. However, George Roden and Koresh began to clash. Koresh soon enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the Branch Davidian community.\n\nAs an attempt to regain support, George Roden challenged Koresh to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. This illegal activity gave Koresh an opportunity to attempt to file charges against Roden, however he was told he needed evidence. This led to the November 3, 1987 raid on the Mount Carmel Center by Koresh and 7 of his followers equipped with five .223 caliber semiautomatic rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, two 12-gauge shotguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition. Their objective seemed to be to retake the land that Koresh had left three years earlier although they claim to have been trying to obtain evidence of Roden's illegal activity, yet they did not come equipped with a camera.\n\nThe trial ended with the jury finding the followers of Koresh not guilty, but were unable to agree on Koresh. After the followers were found not guilty Koresh invited the prosecutors to Mount Carmel for ice cream.\n\nBy the time of the 1993 Waco siege, Koresh had encouraged his followers to think of themselves as \"students of the Seven Seals\" rather than as \"Branch Davidians.\" During the standoff, one of his followers publicly announced that he wanted them to thereafter be identified by the name \"Koreshians\".\"Mr. Ricks [FBI negotiator] said today that Ms. Schroeder had told him that members of the sect, a renegade offshoot of Seventh-day Adventists, henceforth wanted to be known as Koreshians.\" By Robert Reinhold, Published: March 15, 1993 New York Times [brackets added].\n\nIt is claimed that Koresh was never authorized to use the name \"Branch Davidians\" for his breakaway sect,The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists and that the church of that name continues to represent that part of the Branch church which did not follow him.\n\nAs spiritual leader \n\nKoresh, having gained the role of spiritual leader from Roden, asserted his spiritual role by changing from his birth name Vernon Howell to David Koresh, suggesting ties to the biblical King David and to Cyrus the Great (Koresh being Hebrew for Cyrus). In 1989 Koresh used this power as spiritual leader to take several \"spiritual\" wives as young as 12http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2588106/We-werent-brainwashed-Waco-cult-survivor-claims-new-memoir-Branch-Davidian-leader-David-Koresh-19-wives-slept-girls-young-12.htmlh he was to create a new lineage of world rulers. This raised allegations of child abuse, which contributed to the siege by the ATF.\n\nInterpreting Revelation 5:2, Koresh identified himself with the Lamb mentioned in the verse. This is traditionally interpreted as a symbol of Jesus Christ, however Koresh suggested that the Lamb was to come before and lay a path ahead of the second coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nWaco siege\n\nOn February 28, 1993 at 9:45 am, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms attempted to execute a search warrant relating to alleged sexual abuse charges and illegal weapons violations.Affidavit of Davy Aguilera, Special Agent with the US Treasury Department, BATF, Austin, Texas, sworn before Dennis G. Green, United States Magistrate Judge Western District of Texas – Waco on the 25 February 1993. Aguilera affirmed: \"On January 13, 1993, I interviewed Larry Gilbreath in Waco, Texas, and confirmed the information which had previously been related to me by Lt. Barber. Mr. Gilbreath told me that although he had been making deliveries at the \"Mag-Bag\" and the Mt. Carmel Center for quite some time, his suspicion about the packages being delivered to those places was never aroused until about February 1992. At that time the invoices accompanying a number of packages reflected that they contained firearm parts and accessories as well as various chemicals. He stated that in May 1992, a package which was addressed to the \"Mag-Bag\" accidentally broke open while it was being loaded on his delivery truck. He saw that it contained three other boxes, the contents of which were \"pineapple\" type hand grenades which he believed to be inert. He stated that there were about 50 of the grenades and that he later delivered them to the Mt. Carmel Center.\" The ATF attempted to breach the compound for approximately two hours until their ammo ran low. Four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) were killed and another 16 agents were wounded during the raid. The five Branch Davidians killed in the 9:45 am raid were Winston Blake (British), Peter Gent (Australian), Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two at the hands of the Branch Davidians themselves. Almost six hours after the ceasefire, Michael Schroeder was shot dead by ATF agents who alleged he fired a pistol at agents as he attempted to re-enter the compound with Woodrow Kendrick and Norman Allison.Neil Rawles (February 2, 2007). Inside Waco (Television documentary). Channel 4/HBO. His wife claimed that he was merely returning from work and had not participated in the day's earlier altercation. Schroeder had been shot once in the eye, once in the heart, and five times in the back.Linda Thompson (1993). Waco, the Big Lie (Documentary short film) US: American Justice Federation\n\nAfter the raid, ATF agents established contact with Koresh and others inside of the compound. The FBI took command after the deaths of federal agents, and managed to facilitate the release of 19 children (without their parents) relatively early into the negotiations.Psychotherapy Networker (2007). \"Stairway to Heaven; Treating children in the crosshairs of trauma.\" Excerpt from the book The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog by Bruce Perry and Maia Szalavitz. The children were then interviewed by the FBI and the Texas Rangers. Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the raid. On April 19, 1993 the FBI moved for a final siege of the compound using large weaponry such as .50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV) to combat the heavily armed Branch Davidians. The FBI attempted to use tear gas to flush out the Branch Davidians without bloodshed. Officially, FBI agents were only permitted to return any incoming fire, not to actively assault the Branch Davidians. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI's response was to increase the amount of gas being used. Around noon, three fires broke out simultaneously in different parts of the building, The government maintains the fires were deliberately started by Branch Davidians. Some Branch Davidian survivors maintain that the fires were started either accidentally or deliberately by the assault. 76 Branch Davidians died on April 19 (with only nine surviving), killed by rubble, suffocating effects of the fire, or by gunshot wound from fellow Branch Davidians. The siege lasted 51 days.\n\nAftermath \n\nIn all, 4 ATF agents were killed, 16 were wounded, 6 Branch Davidians were killed in the initial raid on February 28 and 76 more were killed in the final assault on April 19. The events at Waco spurred criminal prosecution and civil litigation. A federal grand jury indicted 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians charging them with aiding and abetting in murder of federal officers, and unlawful possession and use of various firearms. Eight Branch Davidians were convicted on firearms charges, 5 convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and four were acquitted of all charges.p. 7403 of the trial transcripts As of July 2007, all Branch Davidians had been released from prison.\n\nSeveral civil suits were brought against the United States government, federal officials, former governor of Texas Ann Richards, and members of the Texas Army National Guard. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them. One case, Andrade v. Chojnacki made it to the Fifth Circuit, which upheld a previous ruling of \"take-nothing, denied\".Andrade v. Chojnacki, 338 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2003), cert. denied (2004).\n\nThe Branch, The Lord Our Righteousness\n\nOne modern incarnation of The Branch Davidians exists under the leadership of Charles Pace, a follower of Ben and Lois Roden, who was a member of the Branch Davidians since the mid-1970s. He claims that Koresh twisted the Bible’s teachings by fathering more than a dozen children with members’ wives. Pace feels the Lord \"has anointed me and appointed me to be the leader\" but he claims he is \"not a prophet\" but \"a teacher of righteousness\". Like the Branch Davidians under Koresh, this incarnation is waiting for the end of times.",
