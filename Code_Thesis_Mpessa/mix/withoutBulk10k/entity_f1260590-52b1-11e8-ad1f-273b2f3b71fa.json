  "textBody" : "Eusebius Amort (November 15, 1692 – February 5, 1775) was a German Roman Catholic theologian.\n\nLife\n\nAmort was born at Bibermuhle, near Tolz, in Upper Bavaria.  He studied at Munich, and at an early age joined the Canons Regular at Polling, where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and philosophy.\nThe Parnassus Boicus learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustinian fathers: Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671-1731), a famous preacher in the German language and Agnellus Kandler (1692-1745), a genealogist and librarian. The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first volume of the Parnassus Boicus journal, communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences.\n\nIn 1733 Amort went to Rome as theologian to Cardinal Niccolo Maria Lercari (d. 1757).\nHe returned to Polling in 1735 and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in Bavaria.
