Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965,Stephanie Kwolek, Hiroshi Mera and Tadahiko Takata \"High-Performance Fibers\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  this high-strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.\n\nCurrently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, because of its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel. It is also used to make modern drumheads that withstand high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications.\n\nA similar fiber called Twaron with roughly the same chemical structure was developed by Akzo in the 1970s; commercial production started in 1986, and Twaron is now manufactured by Teijin.Tatsuya Hongū, Glyn O. Phillips, New Fibers, Ellis Horwood, 1990, p. 22J. K. Fink, Handbook of Engineering and Specialty Thermoplastics: Polyolefins and Styrenics, Scrivener Publishing, 2010, p. 35\n\nHistory\n\nPoly-paraphenylene terephthalamide – branded Kevlar – was invented by Polish-American chemist Stephanie Kwolek while working for DuPont, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage. In 1964, her group began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light but strong tires. The polymers she had been working with at the time, poly-p-phenylene-terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystal while in solution, something unique to those polymers at the time.\n\nThe solution was \"cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity\" and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution, and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.\n\nProduction\n\nKevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially used for the polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of N-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride. As this process had been patented by Akzo (see above) in the production of Twaron, a patent war ensued.[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/kevlar.html How Kevlar® works: a simple introduction].

Retrieved on 2012-05-26.\n\nKevlar (poly paraphenylene terephthalamide) production is expensive because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated sulfuric acid, needed to keep the water-insoluble polymer in solution during its synthesis and spinning.\n\nSeveral grades of Kevlar are available:\nKevlar K-29 – in industrial applications, such as cables, asbestos replacement, brake linings, and body/vehicle armor.\nKevlar K49 – high modulus used in cable and rope products.\nKevlar K100 – colored version of Kevlar\nKevlar K119 – higher-elongation, flexible and more fatigue resistant\nKevlar K129 – higher tenacity for ballistic applications\nKevlar AP – 15% higher tensile strength than K-29[http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/assets/downloads/K23339_KevlarAP.pdf Kevlar K-29 AP Technical Data Sheet] – Dupont\nKevlar XP – lighter weight resin and KM2 plus fiber combination[http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/products/life_protection/kevlarxp_dupont.html Kevlar XP] – Dupont\nKevlar KM2 – enhanced ballistic resistance for armor applications[http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/products/life_protection/kevlar_km2.html Kevlar KM2 Technical Description]. dupont.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-26.\n\nThe ultraviolet component of sunlight degrades and decomposes Kevlar, a problem known as UV degradation, and so it is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight.\n\nStructure and properties\n\nWhen Kevlar is spun, the resulting fiber has a tensile strength of about 3,620 MPa, and a relative density of 1.44.  The polymer owes its high strength to the many inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and NH centers.  Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as Dyneema. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.Michael C. Petty, Molecular electronics: from principles to practice, John Wiley & Sons, 2007, p. 310\n\nThermal properties\n\nKevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic temperatures (−196 °C); in fact, it is slightly stronger at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10–20%, and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further. For example, at 160 °C (320 °F) about 10% reduction in strength occurs after 500 hours. At 260 °C (500 °F) 50% strength reduction occurs after 70 hours.[http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/assets/downloads/KEVLAR_Technical_Guide.pdf KEVLAR Technical Guide]. dupont.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-26.\n\nApplications\n\nProtection\n\nCryogenics\n\nKevlar is often used in the field of cryogenics for its low thermal conductivity and high strength relative to other materials for suspension purposes. It is most often used to suspend a paramagnetic salt enclosure from a superconducting magnet mandrel in order to minimize any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material. It is also used as a thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired.\n\nArmor\n\nKevlar is a well-known component of personal armor such as combat helmets, ballistic face masks, and ballistic vests. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces, use Kevlar as a key component in their construction. Other military uses include bulletproof facemasks and spall liners used to protect the crews of armoured fighting vehicles.  Nimitz-class aircraft carriers utilise Kevlar reinforcement in vital areas.  Civilian applications include: high heat resistance uniforms worn by firefighters, body armour worn by police officers, security, and police tactical teams such as SWAT.[http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/uses_apps/body_armor/index.html Body Armor Made with Kevlar].

Kevlar-based protective gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made of more traditional materials.\n\nSports\n\nPersonal protection\n\nIt is used for motorcycle safety clothing, especially in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows. In fencing it is used in the protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being used in the peto, the padded covering which protects the picadors' horses in the bullring. Speedskaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates in the event of a fall or collision.\n\nEquipment\n\nIn kyudo, or Japanese archery, it may be used as an alternative to more expensive hemp for bow strings. It is one of the main materials used for paraglider suspension lines. It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. Tennis racquets are sometimes strung with Kevlar. It is used in sails for high performance racing boats.\n\nShoes\n\nIn 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in shoes for the first time. It launched the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior as well as the shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.\n\nCycle tires\n\nContinental AG have manufactured cycle tires with Kevlar to protect again punctures.\n\nMusic\n\nAudio equipment\n\nKevlar has also been found to have useful acoustic properties for loudspeaker cones, specifically for bass and midrange drive units.[http://www.audioholics.com/reviews/speakers/bookshelf/bw-cm1/cm1-design-and-construction Audio speaker use].

The cables have been used in suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking.

The window has provided vacuum tightness combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of radiation length).\n\nSmartphones\n\nThe Motorola RAZR Family, the Motorola Droid Maxx, and the OnePlus 2 have a Kevlar backplate, chosen over other materials such as carbon fiber due to its resilience and lack of interference with signal transmission.[https://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/DROID-RAZR-BY-MOTOROLA-US-EN Droid RAZR].

Retrieved November 4, 2011\n\nMarine current turbines and wind turbines\n\nThe Kevlar fiber/epoxy matrix composite materials can be used in marine current turbines (MCT) or wind turbines due to their high specific strength and light weight compared to other fibers.\n\nComposite materials\n\nAramid fibers are widely used for reinforcing composite materials, often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber. The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin. Typical applications include monocoque bodies for F1 racing cars, helicopter rotor blades, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash rackets, kayaks, cricket bats, and field hockey, ice hockey and lacrosse sticks.Kadolph, Sara J.
