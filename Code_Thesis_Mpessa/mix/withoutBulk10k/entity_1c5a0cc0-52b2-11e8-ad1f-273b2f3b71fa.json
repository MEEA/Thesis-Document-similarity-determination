  "textBody" : "Giulio Cesare was one of three  dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s. She served in both World Wars, although she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in reserve. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.\n\nBoth Giulio Cesare and her sister ship, , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, when the former was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers attacked the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, but Giulio Cesare was not damaged. She escorted several convoys to North Africa and participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late 1940 and the First Battle of Sirte in late 1941. She was designated as a training ship in early 1942, and escaped to Malta after Italy surrendered. The ship was transferred to the Soviet Union in 1949 and renamed Novorossiysk (). The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk, with the loss of 608 men, when an old German mine exploded in 1955. She was salvaged the following year and later scrapped.\n\nDescription\n\nNamed after Julius Caesar, Giulio Cesare was  long at the waterline, and 176 m overall. The ship had a beam of 28 m, and a draft of .Gardiner & Gray, p. 259 She displaced 23088 LT at normal load, and 25086 LT at deep load. She had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272 The ship's machinery consisted of four Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft. Steam for the turbines was provided by 24 Babcock & Wilcox boilers, half of which burned fuel oil and the other half burning both oil and coal. Designed to reach a maximum speed of  from 31000 shp, Giulio Cesare failed to reach this goal on her sea trials, despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines. The ship only made a maximum speed of  using 30700 shp. She had a cruising radius of 4800 nmi at 10 kn.\n\nThe ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen 305 mm /46 Model 1909 guns in three triple-gun turret and two twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The secondary battery comprised eighteen 120 mm guns, all mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull. Giulio Cesare was also armed with fourteen 76 mm guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with three submerged 450 mm torpedo tubes. She was protected with Krupp cemented steel manufactured by Terni. The belt armor was 250 mm thick and the main deck was 40 mm thick. The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 280 mm worth of armor plating.Giorgerini, pp. 271–72\n\nModifications and reconstruction\n\nShortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76 mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels,Giorgerini, p. 277 the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, either one or both of the ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.\n\nGiulio Cesare began an extensive reconstruction in October 1933 at the Cantieri del Tirreno shipyard in Genoa that lasted until October 1937.Bargoni & Gay, p. 19 A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow which increased her length by  to  and her beam increased to . The ship's draft at deep load increased to . All of the changes made increased her displacement to 26140 LT at standard load and 29100 LT at deep load. The ship's crew increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.Brescia, p. 58 Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at 75000 shp. The boilers were replaced by eight Yarrow boilers. On her sea trials in December 1936, before her reconstruction was fully completed, Giulio Cesare reached a speed of  from 93430 shp.McLaughlin 2003, p. 422 In service her maximum speed was about 27 kn and she had a range of 6400 nmi at a speed of 13 kn.Bagnasco & Grossman, pp. 64–65\n\nThe main guns were bored out to 320 mm and the center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed. All of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120 mm guns in six twin-gun turrets and eight 100 mm AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ship was fitted with a dozen Breda 37 mm light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve  Breda M31 anti-aircraft machine guns, also in twin mounts.Bagnasco & Grossman, p. 65 In 1940 the 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by 20 mm AA guns in twin mounts. Giulio Cesare received two more twin mounts as well as four additional 37 mm guns in twin mounts on the forecastle between the two turrets in 1941. The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with 260 mm thick armor.Bargoni & Gay, p. 21 Atop the conning tower there was a fire-control director fitted with two large stereo-rangefinders, with a base length of .\n\nThe deck armor was increased during the reconstruction to a total of 135 mm over the engine and boiler rooms and 166 mm over the magazines, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with 50 mm plates. All this armor weighed a total of 3227 LT. The existing underwater protection was replaced by the Pugliese torpedo defense system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked, however, enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ship's increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 421–22\n\nConstruction and service\n\nGiulio Cesare, named after Julius Caesar,Silverstone, p. 298 was laid down at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa on 24 June 1910 and launched on 15 October 1911. She was completed on 14 May 1914 and served as a flagship in the southern Adriatic Sea during World War I.Preston, p. 176 She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic.Halpern, p. 150 The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.Halpern, pp. 141–142\n\nGiulio Cesare made port visits in the Levant in 1919 and 1920. Both Giulio Cesare and Conte di Cavour supported Italian operations on Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff were murdered on Corfu; Benito Mussolini was not satisfied with the Greek government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. Cesare became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. She was reconstructed at Cantieri del Tirreno, Genoa, between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by Adolf Hitler in the Bay of Naples in May 1938 and covered the invasion of Albania in May 1939.Whitley, pp. 158–61\n\nWorld War II\n\nEarly in World War II, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo), together with Conte di Cavour, on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, during which she engaged major elements of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to Alexandria, while the Italians had finished escorting another from Naples to Benghazi, Libya. Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly 29000 yd. The two leading British battleships,  and , replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from Giulio Cesare began to straddle Warspite which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. At that same time, a shell from Warspite struck Giulio Cesare at a distance of about 26000 yd. The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly 20 ft across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to 18 kn. Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged.O'Hara, pp. 28–35 Repairs to Giulio Cesare were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to Malta in August and September.Whitley, p. 161\n\nOn the night of 11 November 1940, Giulio Cesare and the other Italian battleships were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier , along with several other warships. One torpedo sank Conte di Cavour in shallow water, but Giulio Cesare was not hit during the attack.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 81 She participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by Vickers Wellington bombers of the Royal Air Force; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February. On 8 February, she sailed from to the Straits of Bonifacio to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy, but was actually a raid on Genoa. She failed to make contact with any British forces. She participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, and briefly engaging the escort force of a British convoy (during the battle, the destroyer Kipling suffered some damage from near misses, variably credited to Cesare, Doria or the heavy cruiser Gorizia).Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare, p. 343. She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942.Whitley, pp. 161–62 Giulio Cesare was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later Pola.Brescia, p. 59 The  unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the Gulf of Taranto in early March 1944.Rohwer, pp. 272, 298 After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943, she steamed to Taranto, putting down a mutiny and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route. She then sailed for Malta where she arrived on 12 September to be interned. The ship remained there until 17 June 1944 when she returned to Taranto where she remained for the next four years.Whitley, p. 162\n\nSoviet service\n\nAfter the war, Giulio Cesare was allocated to the Soviet Union as part of the war reparations and she was moved to Augusta, Sicily on 9 December 1948 where an unsuccessful attempt was made to sabotage the ship. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 15 December and turned over to the Soviets on 6 February 1949 under the temporary name of Z11 in Vlorë, Albania. She was renamed by them as Novorossiysk, after the Soviet city on the Black Sea. The Soviets used her as a training ship when she was not undergoing one of her eight refits in their hands. In 1953, all remaining Italian light AA guns were replaced by eighteen 37 mm 70-K AA guns in six twin mounts and six singles. They also replaced her fire-control systems and added radars, although the exact changes are unknown. The Soviets intended to rearm her with their own 305 mm guns, but this was forestalled by her loss. While at anchor in Sevastopol on the night of 28/29 October 1955, she most likely detonated a large German mine left over from World War II. The explosion blew a hole completely through the ship, making a 4 by hole in the forecastle forward of 'A' turret. The flooding could not be controlled and she later capsized with the loss of 608 men, including men sent from other ships to assist.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 419, 422\n\nThe cause of the explosion is still unclear. The officially named cause, regarded as the most probable, was a magnetic RMH or LMB bottom mine, laid by the Germans during World War II and triggered by the dragging of the battleship's anchor chain before mooring for the last time. Subsequent searches located 32 mines of these types, some of them within 50 m of the explosion. The damage was consistent with an explosion of 1000 - of TNT and more than one mine may have detonated. Nonetheless, other explanations for the ship's loss have been proposed and the most popular of these is that she was sunk by Italian frogmen of the wartime special operations unit Decima Flottiglia MAS who — more than ten years after the cessation of hostilities — were either avenging the transfer of the former Italian battleship to the USSR or sinking it on behalf of NATO.McLaughlin 2003, p. 423McLaughlin 2007, pp. 142–52Greene & Massignani, pp. 195–98 Novorossiysk was stricken from the naval register on 24 February 1956, salvaged on 4 May 1957, and subsequently scrapped.\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes",
