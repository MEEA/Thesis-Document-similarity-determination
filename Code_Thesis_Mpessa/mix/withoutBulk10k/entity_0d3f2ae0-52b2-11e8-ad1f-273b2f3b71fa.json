  "textBody" : "The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering is a 2000 book by Norman G. Finkelstein, in which the author argues that the American Jewish establishment exploits the memory of the Nazi Holocaust for political and financial gain, as well as to further the interests of Israel.See article on [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg3&ar\n11 Norman Finklestein's webpage]. According to Finkelstein, this \"Holocaust industry\" has corrupted Jewish culture and the authentic memory of the Holocaust.\n\nFinkelstein on the book\n\nFinkelstein states that his consciousness of \"the Nazi holocaust\" is rooted in his parents' experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto; with the exception of his parents themselves, \"every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis\".The Holocaust Industry, p. 5-8. Nonetheless, during his childhood, no one ever asked any questions about what his mother and father had suffered. He suggests,  \"This was not a respectful silence. It was indifference.\" It was only after the establishment of \"the Holocaust industry\", he suggests, that outpourings of anguish over the plight of the Jews in World War II began.  This ideology in turn served to endow Israel with a status as \"'victim' state\" despite its \"horrendous\" human rights record.\n\nAccording to Finkelstein, his book is \"an anatomy and an indictment of the Holocaust industry\". He argues that \"'The Holocaust' is an ideological representation of the Nazi holocaust\".The Holocaust Industry, p. 3.\n\nIn the foreword to the first paperback edition, Finkelstein notes that the first hardback edition had been a considerable hit in several European countries and many languages, but had been largely ignored in the United States. He sees The New York Times as the main promotional vehicle of the \"Holocaust industry\", and notes that the 1999 Index listed 273 entries for the Holocaust and just 32 entries for the entire continent of Africa.\n\nChapters\n\n*Chapter 1: Capitalizing The Holocaust - by the 1980s, Finkelstein states, the \"War against the Jews\" had become more important to American cultural life than the \"War Between the States\".(p. 11)\n*Chapter 2: Hoaxers, Hucksters and History - in 1967, Finkelstein claims that two concepts appeared in public discourse: The uniqueness of the Holocaust, and the concept of the Holocaust as climax of a historical irrational anti-Semitic tendency in Europe. Finkelstein asserts that these concepts became central to the \"Holocaust Industry\", but that neither figures in scholarship of the Nazi Holocaust.(p. 13)\n*Chapter 3: The Double Shakedown - in this chapter, Finkelstein claims that the number of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust recognized by relief groups increased from c. 100,000 in 1945Henry Friedlander, \"Darkness and Dawn in 1945: The Nazis, the Allies, and the Survivors,\" in US Holocaust Memorial Museum, 1945 - the Year of Liberation (Washington: 1995), 11-35. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.81. to nearly 1 million1997 study commissioned by the Israeli Prime Minister's office.(p.67) owing to definitional changes in who was considered to be a survivor. Because of this, Finkelstein repeatedly asserts that fraudulent claims were made on Switzerland, while accounts and assets in the US and Israel were ignored. Payments were made to the wrong people and real survivors lost out.\nThe second (2003) edition contained 100 pages of new material, primarily in chapter 3 on the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks. Finkelstein set out to provide a guide to the relevant sections of the case. He feels that the presiding judge elected not to docket crucial documents, and that the Claims Resolution Tribunal could no longer be trusted. Finkelstein claims the CRT was on course to vindicate the Swiss banks before it changed tack in order to \"protect the blackmailers' reputation\".\n\nReviews and critiques\n\nThe critical response has been varied. In addition to prominent supporters, such as Noam Chomsky and Alexander Cockburn, the Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg is on record as praising Finkelstein's book:  \n\nOn the other hand, many have argued that The Holocaust Industry is an unscholarly work that promotes antisemitic stereotypes. For example, according to Israeli journalist Yair Sheleg, in August 2000, German historian Hans Mommsen called it \"a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices.\"http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?PG3&AR\n11 Wolfgang Benz stated to Le Monde: \"It is impossible to learn anything from Finkelstein's book.

Finkelstein (especially on the impact of the Six-days war) are wrong, others being pieces of \"propaganda\".\n\nUniversity of Chicago Professor Peter Novick, whose work Finkelstein described as providing the \"initial stimulus\" for The Holocaust Industry,[https://books.google.com/books?idVrqK5VdO2i0C&pg\nPA4&dq%22initial+stimulus+for+this+book+was+Peter+Novick%27s+seminal+study%22&sig\nx2OveMwYQ1YeVM_U08DYFFhRcYk The Holocaust Industry, p. 4.] asserted in the July 28, 2000 Jewish Chronicle (London) that the book is replete with \"false accusations\", \"egregious misrepresentations\", \"absurd claims\" and \"repeated mis-statements\" (\"A charge into darkness that sheds no light\"). Finkelstein replied to the allegations by Novick on his homepage.http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg3&ar\n165\n\nHasia Diner has accused Peter Novick and Finkelstein of being \"harsh critics of American Jewry from the left,\" and challenges the notion reflected in their books that American Jews did not begin to commemorate the Holocaust until post 1967.All Quiet; Were postwar American Jews really ‘silent’ about the Holocaust? BY ADAM KIRSCH | 7:00 am June 23, 2009, Tablet Magazine [http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/books/all-quiet121/]\n\nAndrew Ross, reviewing the book for Salon, wrote:\n\nFinkelstein's response to critics\n\nFinkelstein responded to his critics in the foreword to the second edition:\n\nOther topics\n\nFraudulent writings on the Holocaust\n\nFinkelstein describes two known frauds, that of The Painted Bird by Polish writer Jerzy Kosinski and Fragments by Binjamin Wilkomirski, and how they were defended by people even after they had been exposed. He identifies some of these people as members of the \"Holocaust Industry\", and notes that they also support each other. Elie Wiesel supported Kosinski; Israel Gutman and Daniel Goldhagen (see below) supported Wilkomirski; Wiesel and Gutman support Goldhagen.\n\nOther genocides\n\nFinkelstein scathingly compared the media treatment of the Holocaust and the media treatment of other genocides such as the Holodomor and the Armenian Genocide, particularly by members of what he calls \"The Holocaust Industry\". 1 to 1.5 million Armenians died in the years between 1915 and 1917/1923 - denial includes the claim that they were the result of a civil war within World War I, or refusal to accept there were deaths. In 2001, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres went so far as to dismiss it as \"allegations\". However, by this time historical consensus was changing, and he was \"angrily compared ... to a holocaust denier\" by Israel Charny, executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem.[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/peres-stands-accused-over-denial-of-meaningless-armenian-holocaust-681774.html Peres stands accused over denial of `meaningless' Armenian Holocaust\"].

Verified 22 Jun 2008.\n\nOther forms of Holocaust denial\n\nAccording to Finkelstein, Elie Wiesel characterized any suggestion that he has profited from the \"Holocaust Industry\", or even any criticism at all, as Holocaust denial.Wiesel, All Rivers, 333, 336. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70. Questioning a survivor's testimony, denouncing the role of Jewish collaborators, suggesting that Germans suffered during the bombing of Dresden or that any state except Germany committed crimes in World War II are all evidence of Holocaust denial – according to Deborah LipstadtLipstadt, Denying, 6, 12, 22, 89-90. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70. – and the most \"insidious\" forms of Holocaust denial are \"immoral equivalencies\", denying the uniqueness of The Holocaust.Lipstadt, Denying, chapter 11. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70. Finkelstein examines the implications of applying this standard to another member of the \"Holocaust Industry\", Daniel Goldhagen, who argued that Serbian actions in Kosovo \"are, in their essence, different from those of Nazi Germany only in scale\".\"A New Serbia\" in New Republic (17 May 1999). Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70.\n\nHolocaust deniers in real life\n\nAccording to Finkelstein, Deborah Lipstadt claims there is widespread Holocaust denial - yet in Denying the Holocaust (1993) her prime example is Arthur Butz, author of The Hoax of the Twentieth Century. The chapter on him is entitled \"Entering the Mainstream\" - but Finkelstein considers that, were it not for the likes of Lipstadt, no one would ever have heard of Arthur Butz. Holocaust deniers have as much influence in the US as the Flat Earth Society (p. 69). Finkelstein believes there to be only one \"truly mainstream\" holocaust denier—Bernard Lewis, who was convicted in France of denying the Armenian genocide.\"France Fines Historian Over Armenian Denial,\" in Boston Globe (22 June 1995), and \"Bernard Lewis and the Armenians,\" in Counterpunch (16–31 December 1997). Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.69.
