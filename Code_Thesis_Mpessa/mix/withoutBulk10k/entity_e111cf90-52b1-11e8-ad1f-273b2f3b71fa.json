  "textBody" : "' is a Latin philosophical proposition by  usually translated into English as \"I think, therefore I am\". The phrase originally appeared in French as  in his Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It appeared in Latin in his later Principles of Philosophy. As Descartes explained, \"we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt....\" A fuller form, penned by Antoine Léonard Thomas, aptly captures Descartes’s intent: ' (\"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am\"). The concept is also sometimes known as the cogito.\"\n[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cogito Cogito]\". Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press.\n\nThis proposition became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to form a secure foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity—in this case the self—for there to be a thought.\n\nIn Descartes's writings\n\nDescartes first wrote the phrase in French in his 1637 Discourse on the Method. He referred to it in Latin without explicitly stating the familiar form of the phrase in his 1641 Meditations on First Philosophy. The earliest written record of the phrase in Latin is in his 1644 Principles of Philosophy, where, in a margin note (see below), he provides a clear explanation of his intent: \"[W]e cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt\". Fuller forms of the phrase are attributable to other authors.\n\nDiscourse on the Method\n\nThe phrase first appeared (in French) in Descartes's 1637 Discourse on the Method in the first paragraph of its fourth part:\n\nMeditations on First Philosophy\n\nIn 1641, Descartes published (in Latin) Meditations on first philosophy in which he referred to the proposition, though not explicitly as \"cogito ergo sum\" in Meditation II:\n\nPrinciples of Philosophy\n\nIn 1644, Descartes published (in Latin) his Principles of Philosophy where the phrase \"ego cogito, ergo sum\" appears in Part 1, article 7:\n\nDescartes's margin note for the above paragraph is:\n\nOther forms\n\nThe proposition is sometimes given as . This fuller form was penned by the eloquent French literary critic, Antoine Léonard Thomas, in an award-winning 1765 essay in praise of Descartes, where it appeared as  In English, this is \"Since I doubt, I think; since I think, I exist\"; with rearrangement and compaction, \"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am\", or in Latin, \"dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum\".\n\nA further expansion,  (\"…—a thinking thing\") extends the cogito with Descartes's statement in the subsequent Meditation, , or, in English, \"I am a thinking (conscious) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many …\". This has been referred to as \"the expanded cogito\".\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe phrase cogito ergo sum is not used in Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy but the term \"the cogito\" is used to refer to an argument from it.  In the Meditations, Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as \"that the proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.\" (Meditation II)\n\nAt the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt—his argument from the existence of a deceiving god—Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists.  Even if there were a deceiving god (or an evil demon), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for there is no way one could be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived.\n\nBut I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies.  Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me.  In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something.  So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16–17)\n\nThere are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of his own existence from the first-person point of view — he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that if he thinks, then necessarily he exists (see the instantiation principle). Third, this proposition \"I am, I exist\" is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition. Descartes does not use this first certainty, the cogito, as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to discover further truthsSelf, Reason, and Freedom: A New Light on Descartes' Metaphysics Andrea Christofidou; chapter 2  As he puts it:\n\nArchimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16)\n\nAccording to many Descartes specialists, including Étienne Gilson, the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion — the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions — to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes's thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the cogito — a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see — but on using the cogito as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence.\nBaruch Spinoza in \"Principia philosophiae cartesianae\" at its Prolegomenon identified \"cogito ergo sum\" the \"ego sum cogitans\" (I am a thinking being) as the thinking substance with his ontological interpretation. It can also be considered that Cogito ergo sum is needed before any living being can go further in life\".\n\nPredecessors\n\nAlthough the idea expressed in cogito ergo sum is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. Plato spoke about the \"knowledge of knowledge\" (Greek νόησις νοήσεως nóesis noéseos) and Aristotle explains the idea in full length:\nBut if life itself is good and pleasant (...) and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (Nicomachean Ethics, 1170a25 ff.)\n\nAugustine of Hippo in De Civitate Dei writes Si […] fallor, sum (\"If I am mistaken, I am\") (book XI, 26), and also anticipates modern refutations of the concept.  Furthermore, in the Enchiridion Augustine attempts to refute skepticism by stating, \"[B]y not positively affirming that they are alive, the skeptics ward off the appearance of error in themselves, yet they do make errors simply by showing themselves alive; one cannot err who is not alive. That we live is therefore not only true, but it is altogether certain as well\" (Chapter 7 section 20). Another predecessor was Avicenna's \"Floating Man\" thought experiment on human self-awareness and self-consciousness.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein and Leaman, Oliver (1996), History of Islamic Philosophy, Routledge, p. 315, .\n\nThe 8th century Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara wrote in a similar fashion, No one thinks, 'I am not', arguing that one's existence cannot be doubted, as there must be someone there to doubt.Radhakrishnan, S. (1948), Indian Philosophy, vol II, p. 476, George Allen & Unwin Ltd, . The central idea of cogito ergo sum is also the topic of Mandukya Upanishad. \n\nSpanish philosopher Gómez Pereira in his 1554 work De Inmortalitate Animae, published in 1749, wrote \"nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum\" (\"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\").Gómez Pereira, Antoniana Margarita: \"De Immortalitate Animae\", 1749 [1554], p. 277.Santos López, Modesto (1986). \"Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense\". In: Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión, ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.\n\nCritique\n\nUse of \"I\"\n\nIn Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry, Bernard Williams provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. Apparently, the first scholar who raised the \"I\" problem was Pierre Gassendi. He \"points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation that there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking to a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to prove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the capacity for thought\". In other words, \"the only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present\". from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy The objection, as presented by Georg Lichtenberg, is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: \"thinking is occurring.\" That is, whatever the force of the cogito, Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the \"I,\" is more than the cogito can justify. Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an \"I\", that there is such an activity as \"thinking\", and that \"I\" know what \"thinking\" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be \"it thinks\" wherein the \"it\" could be an impersonal subject as in the sentence \"It is raining.\"\n\nKierkegaard's critique\n\nThe Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard provided a critical response to the cogito.Kierkegaard, Søren. Philosophical Fragments. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 38-42. In the Concluding Unscientific Postscript, he writes: \n\nKierkegaard argues that the cogito already presupposes the existence of \"I\", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise \"I think\" into two further premises:\n*\"x\" thinks\n*I am that \"x\"\n*Therefore, I think\n*Therefore, I am\n\nWhere \"x\" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the \"I\" from the thinking thing.Schönbaumsfeld, Genia. A Confusion of the Spheres. Oxford, 2007. p.168-170.\n\nHere, the cogito has already assumed the \"I\"'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely \"developing the content of a concept\", namely that the \"I\", which already exists, thinks.Kierkegaard, Søren. Philosophical Fragments. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 40. As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.Archie, Lee C., \"Søren Kierkegaard, God's Existence Cannot Be Proved\". Philosophy of Religion. Lander Philosophy, 2006.\n\nWilliams' critique\n\nBernard Williams claims that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say \"I am thinking,\" is something conceivable from a third-person perspective; namely objective \"thought-events\" in the former case, and an objective thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of \"there is thinking\" without relativizing it to something.  However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through introspection, or our experience of consciousness, we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.\n\nHeidegger's critique\n\nAs a critic of Cartesian subjectivity, Heidegger sought to ground human subjectivity in death as that certainty which individualizes and authenticates our being. As he wrote in 1927:\n\n\"This certainty, that \"I myself am in that I will die,\" is the basic certainty of Dasein itself. It is a genuine statement of Dasein, while cogito sum is only the semblance of such a statement. If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be sum moribundus [I am in dying], moribundus not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am moribundus. The MORIBUNDUS first gives the SUM its sense.\"\n\nJohn Macmurray's critique\n\nThe Scottish philosopher John Macmurray rejects the cogito outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitles the Form of the Personal. \"We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality.\" Macmurray, John. The Self as Agent. Humanity books, 1991. p. 78. The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the unity of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves, and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate cogito, Macmurray proposes the substitution of \"I do\" for \"I think\",  ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation.",
