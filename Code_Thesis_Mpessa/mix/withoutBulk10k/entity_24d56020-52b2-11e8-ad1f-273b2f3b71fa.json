  "textBody" : "James Orsen Bakker ( \"baker\"; born January 2, 1940) is an American televangelist, convicted fraudster, former Assemblies of God minister, and  former host (with his then-wife Tammy Faye Bakker) of The PTL Club, an evangelical Christian television program. In addition, he was also known for building Heritage USA in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which opened in 1978. He also wrote several books, such as I Was Wrong and Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead.\n\nA cover-up of hush payments made to his secretary Jessica Hahn for alleged rape led to his resignation from the ministry. Subsequent revelations of accounting fraud brought about his imprisonment and divorce. He later remarried and returned to televangelism, where he currently works on The Jim Bakker Show. He also regularly sells bucket of food to his audience on the show in preparation for the end of days.\nEarly life\n\nBakker was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Raleigh Bakker and Furnia Lynette \"Furn\" Irwin. Bakker attended North Central University, a Bible college affiliated with the Assemblies of God, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where in 1960 he met fellow student Tammy Faye LaValley. He worked at a restaurant inside the Young-Quinlan Department Store in Minneapolis, and she had a job at a nearby boutique called The Three Sisters.\n\nOn April 1, 1961, Bakker and Tammy Faye married. They left the Bible college to become evangelists. They had two children, Tammy Sue \"Sissy\" Bakker Chapman (born March 2, 1970) and Jamie Charles \"Jay\" Bakker (born December 18, 1975). Jim and Tammy Bakker divorced on March 13, 1992.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1966 the Bakkers began working at Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, which at the time barely reached an audience of thousands. The Bakkers greatly contributed to the growth of the network, and their success with a variety show format (including interviews and puppets) helped make The 700 Club one of the longest-running and most successful televangelism programs. The Jim and Tammy Show was broadcast for a few years from their Portsmouth, Virginia, studio and was aimed at young children. The Bakkers have also flew to California in 1984.\n\nBy the early 1980s the Bakkers had built Heritage USA in Fort Mill, South Carolina (south of Charlotte), then the third most successful theme park in the U.S., and a satellite system to distribute their network 24 hours a day across the country. Contributions requested from viewers were estimated to exceed $1 million a week, with proceeds to go to expanding the theme park and mission of PTL. In justifying his use of the mass media, Bakker responded to inquiries by likening his use of television to Jesus's use of the amphitheater of the time. \"I believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would be on TV,\" Bakker said. \n\nIn their success, the Bakkers took conspicuous consumption to an unusual level for a nonprofit organization. In an April 23, 1990, New Yorker article, Frances FitzGerald quoted Dave Barry, who wrote \"they personified the most characteristic excesses of the nineteen-eighties—the greed, the love of glitz, and the shamelessness—which in their case were so pure as to almost amount to a kind of innocence.\" Jim Bakker was dismissed as a minister of the Assemblies of God on May 6, 1987.\n\nLater career\n\nIn January 2003 Bakker began broadcasting the daily Jim Bakker Show at Studio City Café in Branson, Missouri, with his second wife, Lori. It is carried on the Daystar and CTN networks. By way of those outlets, the bulk of Bakker's audience comes from DirecTV and Dish Network. His show currently has a millennial/survivalist focus. He and wife Lori have since adopted and/or taken in five children from the Phoenix inner city neighborhoods Lori once frequented as a part of the Master's Commission, a worldwide discipleship program now based in Relevant Church in the Dallas Metro area. In January 2008 Bakker's ministry moved into a new television studio in Blue Eye, Missouri, near Branson. The studio is housed in a 600 acre development that resembles Bakker's former location, Heritage USA. Most or all of the property in the new development (named Morningside) is owned by associates of Bakker rather than by Bakker himself. Bakker still owes the IRS about $6 million.\n\nOn his current program, he regularly pitches buckets of survival food to sell to his audience in preparation for the end of days. In 2013, Bakker authored Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead about the end-time events. In a October 2017 video, he stated that \"God will punish those\" who make fun of him. In addition, he also stated other numerous things, such as that Hurricane Harvey is God's judgement and he also blamed Hurricane Matthew on then-president Barack Obama. He also made a prediction that if current US President Donald Trump got impeached that Christians would start a Second American Civil War.\n\nControversies\n\nCrimes\n\nThe PTL Clubs fundraising activities between 1984 and 1987 were scrutinised by The Charlotte Observer newspaper, eventually leading to criminal charges against Jim Bakker. From 1984 to 1987, Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 \"lifetime memberships,\" which entitled buyers to a three-night stay annually at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA. According to the prosecution at Bakker's later fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships had been sold, but only one 500-room hotel was ever completed. Bakker sold more \"exclusive partnerships\" than could be accommodated, while raising more than twice the money needed to build the actual hotel. A good deal of the money went into Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million in bonuses for himself.\n\nA $279,000 pay-off for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who claims Bakker and pastor John Wesley Fletcher drugged and raped her, was paid with PTL's funds to Hahn through Bakker associate Roe Messner. Bakker, who made all of the financial decisions for the PTL organization, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal the accounting irregularities. Reporters from The Charlotte Observer, led by Charles Shepard, investigated and published a series of articles regarding the PTL organization's finances.\n\nOn March 19, 1987, following the revelation of a pay-off to Hahn, Bakker resigned from PTL. Bakker acknowledged he met Hahn at a hotel room in Clearwater, Florida, but denied raping her. Following Bakker's resignation as PTL head, he was succeeded in late March 1987, by Jerry Falwell. Later that summer, as donations sharply declined in the wake of Bakker's resignation and the end of the Bakkers' popular PTL Club TV show, Falwell raised $20 million to help keep the Heritage USA Theme Park solvent, including a well-publicized waterslide plunge there.\n\nFraud conviction and incarceration\n\nFollowing a 16-month federal grand jury probe, Bakker was indicted in 1988 on eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy.U.S. v. Bakker, (C.A.4, 1991), 925 F.2d 728, 740, case no. 89-5687 In 1989, after a five-week trial which began on August 28 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the jury found him guilty on all 24 counts, and Judge Robert Daniel Potter sentenced him to 45 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine. He served time in the Federal Medical Center, Rochester, in Rochester, Minnesota, sharing a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche and skydiver Roger Nelson.https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path\n2004/040402/SKYDIVE&search=khakpour Securesite.chireader.com\n\nIn February 1991 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld Bakker's conviction on the fraud and conspiracy charges but voided Bakker's 45-year sentence, as well as the $500,000 fine, and ordered that a new sentencing hearing be held. The court held that Potter's statement at sentencing that Bakker's actions resulted in \"those of us who do have a religion\" being lampooned as \"saps from money-grubbing preachers or priests\" was evidence that he had injected his own religious beliefs into considering Bakker's sentence.United States v. Bakker, 925 F.2d 728 (4th Cir. 1991), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q%22James+O.+Bakker%22&hl\nen&as_sdt3,44&case\n1832676487785187662&scilh=0].\n\nOn November 16, 1992, a sentence reduction hearing was held. Bakker's sentence was reduced to eight years. In August 1993, Bakker was transferred to a minimum security federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, and then he was granted parole in July 1994, after serving almost five years of his sentence. Bakker's son, Jay, spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to the parole board on his father's behalf, urging leniency. He was released from Federal Bureau of Prisons custody on December 1, 1994.\"[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction\nNameSearch&needingMoreListfalse&FirstName\nJames&Middle&LastName\nBakker&RaceU&Sex\nU&Age&x\n95&y=16 James O.

Retrieved on January 8, 2010.\n\nReactions\n\nJerry Falwell called Bakker a liar, an embezzler, a sexual deviant, and \"the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history.\" In 1988, Falwell said that the Bakker scandal had \"strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger, more mature and more committed.\" Bakker's son, Jay, wrote in 2001 that the Bakkers felt betrayed by Falwell, whom they thought, at the time of Bakker's resignation, intended to help in Bakker's eventual restoration as head of the PTL ministry organization.Jay Bakker, Son of a Preacher Man.

He also received criticism over his Civil War prediction from radio host Sam Rohrer stating on \"Stand in the Gap Today\", stating that he disagreed with Bakkers prediction.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nBakker has renounced his past teachings on prosperity theology, saying they were wrong. In his 1996 book, I Was Wrong, he admitted that the first time he actually read the Bible all the way through was while he was in prison, and that it made him realize he had taken certain passages out of context—passages that he had used as \"proof texts\" to back up his prosperity teachings. He wrote:\n\nOn September 4, 1998, Bakker married Lori Beth Graham, a former televangelist, 50 days after they met. Bakker released another book that same year, Prosperity and the Coming Apocalypse , and, in 2000, he published The Refuge: The Joy of Christian Community in a Torn-Apart World .\n\nHis son, Jay, who is now a minister at Revolution Church in Minneapolis, wrote of the PTL years in his book, Son of a Preacher Man: \"The world at large has focused on my parents' preaching of prosperity, but ... I heard a different message—one of forgiveness and the abundance of God's love. I remember my dad always seating a mentally handicapped man in the front row and hugging him.
