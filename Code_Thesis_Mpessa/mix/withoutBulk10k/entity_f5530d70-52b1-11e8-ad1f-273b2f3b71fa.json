ESOC's primary function is the operation of unmanned spacecraft on behalf of ESA and the launch and early orbit phases (LEOP) of ESA and third-party missions.[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/About_Operations ESA Spacecraft Operations - About us & frequently asked questions] The Centre is also responsible for a range of operations-related activities within ESA and in cooperation with ESA's industry and international partners, including ground systems engineering, software development, flight dynamics and navigation, development of mission control tools and techniques and space debris studies.[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/gse/Building_infrastructure_on_Earth_to_support_satellites_in_space ESA’s Ground Systems Engineering Team]\n\nESOC's current major activities comprise operating planetary and solar missions, such as Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, astronomy & fundamental physics missions, such as Gaia (spacecraft) and XMM Newton, and Earth observation missions such as CryoSat2 and Swarm (spacecraft).\n\nESOC is responsible for developing, operating and maintaining ESA's ESTRACK network of ground stations. Teams at the Centre are also involved in research and development related to advanced mission control concepts and Space Situational Awareness, and standardisation activities related to frequency management; mission operations; tracking, telemetry and telecommanding; and space debris.[http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC/Where_missions_come_alive Where missions come alive]\n\nMissions\n\nESOC's current missions comprise the following:[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations ESA Space Operations]\n\nPlanetary and solar missions\n* Mars Express\n* ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter\n* Cluster II\n\nAstronomy and fundamental physics missions\n* Gaia\n* INTEGRAL\n* XMM-Newton\n* LISA Pathfinder\n\nEarth observation missions\n* CryoSat-2\n* Swarm\n* Sentinel-1A\n* Sentinel-1B\n* Sentinel-2A\n* Sentinel-2B\n* Sentinel-5_Precursor\n\nIn addition, the ground segment and mission control teams for several missions are in preparation and training, including:\n\n* BepiColombo\n* ExoMars\n* ADM-Aeolus\n* Biomass\n* EarthCare\n* Euclid\n* JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE)\n* PLATO\n* Solar Orbiter\n* the remaining satellites of the Sentinel programme\n\nESTRACK\n\nESOC hosts the control centre for the Agency's European Tracking ESTRACK station network. The core network comprises 9 stations in seven countries: Kourou (French Guiana), Maspalomas, Villafranca and Cebreros (Spain), Redu (Belgium), Santa Maria (Portugal), Kiruna (Sweden), Malargüe (Argentina) and New Norcia (Australia).

These were augmented by mission control staff transferred from ESTEC to operate satellites and manage the ESTRACK tracking station network.[http://www.esa.int/esapub/sp/sp1235/sp1235v2web.pdf History of the European Space Agency 1958 – 1987][http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/HSR/HSR_08.PDF EUROPE INTO SPACE:THE AUGER YEARS, page 35]\n\nWithin just eight months, ESOC, as part of ESRO, was already operating its first mission, ESRO-2B, a scientific research satellite and the first of many operated from ESOC for ESRO, and later ESA.\n\nBy July 2012, ESOC had operated over 56 missions[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMEFCW4QWD_0.html ESA mission history] spanning science, Earth observation, orbiting observatories, meteorology and space physics.\n\nLocation and expansion\n\nESOC is located on the west side of the city of Darmstadt,[http://goo.gl/maps/rtU9Q Google map] some 500 m from the main train station, at Robert-Bosch-Straße 5.
