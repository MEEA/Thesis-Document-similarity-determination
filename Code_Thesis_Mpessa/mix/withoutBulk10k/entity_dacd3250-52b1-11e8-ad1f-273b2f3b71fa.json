  "textBody" : "In convex geometry, a convex set is a subset of an affine space that is closed under convex combinations. More specifically, in a Euclidean space, a convex region is a region where, for every pair of points within the region, every point on the straight line segment that joins the pair of points is also within the region. For example, a solid cube is a convex set, but anything that is hollow or has an indent, for example, a crescent shape, is not convex.\n\nThe boundary of a convex set is always a convex curve. The intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset  of Euclidean space is called the convex hull of . It is the smallest convex set containing .\n\nA convex function is a real-valued function defined on an interval with the property that its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. Convex minimization is a subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The branch of mathematics devoted to the study of properties of convex sets and convex functions is called convex analysis.\n\nThe notion of a convex set can be generalized as described below.\n\nIn vector spaces \n\nLet  be a vector space over the real numbers, or, more generally, over some ordered field. This includes Euclidean spaces. A set  in  is said to be convex if, for all  and  in  and all  in the interval , the point  also belongs to . In other words, every point on the line segment connecting  and  is in . This implies that a convex set in a real or complex topological vector space is path-connected, thus connected.\nFurthermore,  is strictly convex if every point on the line segment connecting  and  other than the endpoints is inside the interior of .\n\nA set  is called absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced.\n\nThe convex subsets of  (the set of real numbers) are simply the intervals of . Some examples of convex subsets of the Euclidean plane are solid regular polygons, solid triangles, and intersections of solid triangles. Some examples of convex subsets of a Euclidean 3-dimensional space are the Archimedean solids and the Platonic solids. The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra are examples of non-convex sets.\n\nNon-convex set \n\n\"Concave set\" redirects here.\nA set that is not convex is called a non-convex set. A polygon that is not a convex polygon is sometimes called a concave polygon,. and some sources more generally use the term concave set to mean a non-convex set, but most authorities prohibit this usage.\n\nThe complement of a convex set, such as the epigraph of a concave function, is sometimes called a reverse convex set, especially in the context of mathematical optimization..\n\nProperties \n\nIf  is a convex set in -dimensional space, then for any collection of , , -dimensional vectors  in , and for any nonnegative numbers  such that , then one has:\n\\sum_{k=1}^r\\lambda_k u_k \\in S.\nA vector of this type is known as a convex combination of .\n\nIntersections and unions \n\nThe collection of convex subsets of a vector space has the following properties:Soltan, Valeriu, Introduction to the Axiomatic Theory of Convexity, Ştiinţa, Chişinău, 1984 (in Russian).\n\n#The empty set and the whole vector-space are convex.\n#The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex.\n#The union of a non-decreasing sequence of convex subsets is a convex set. For the preceding property of unions of non-decreasing sequences of convex sets, the restriction to nested sets is important: The union of two convex sets need not be convex.\n\nClosed convex sets \n\nClosed convex sets are convex sets that contain all their limit points. They can be characterised as the intersections of closed half-spaces (sets of point in space that lie on and to one side of a hyperplane).\n\nFrom what has just been said, it is clear that such intersections are convex, and they will also be closed sets. To prove the converse, i.e., every convex set may be represented as such intersection, one needs the supporting hyperplane theorem in the form that for a given closed convex set  and point  outside it, there is a closed half-space  that contains  and not . The supporting hyperplane theorem is a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem of functional analysis.\n\nConvex sets and rectangles \n\nLet C be a convex body in the plane. We can inscribe a rectangle r in C such that a homothetic copy R of r is circumscribed about C. The positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and:\n:\\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot\\text{Area}(R) \\leq \\text{Area}(C) \\leq 2\\cdot \\text{Area}(r)\n\nConvex hulls and Minkowski sums \n\nConvex hulls \n\nEvery subset  of the vector space is contained within a smallest convex set (called the convex hull of ), namely the intersection of all convex sets containing . The convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a hull operator:\n\nThe convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a lattice, in which the \"join\" operation is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets\n.\nThe intersection of any collection of convex sets is itself convex, so the convex subsets of a (real or complex) vector space form a complete lattice.\n\nMinkowski addition \n\nIn a real vector-space, the Minkowski sum of two (non-empty) sets,  and , is defined to be the set  formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets\n.\nMore generally, the Minkowski sum of a finite family of (non-empty) sets  is  the set  formed by element-wise addition of vectors\n \\sum_n S_n = \\left \\{ \\sum_n x_n : x_n \\in S_n \\right \\}.\n\nFor Minkowski addition, the zero set  containing only the zero vector  has special importance: For every non-empty subset S of a vector space\n;\nin algebraic terminology,  is the identity element of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets).The empty set is important in Minkowski addition, because the empty set annihilates every other subset: For every subset  of a vector space, its sum with the empty set is empty: .\n\nConvex hulls of Minkowski sums \n\nMinkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition:\n\nLet  be subsets of a real vector-space, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls\n.\n\nThis result holds more generally for each finite collection of non-empty sets:\n\n\\text{Conv}\\left ( \\sum_n S_n \\right ) = \\sum_n \\text{Conv} \\left (S_n \\right).\n\nIn mathematical terminology, the operations of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are commuting operations.Theorem 3 (pages 562–563): For the commutativity of Minkowski addition and convexification, see Theorem 1.1.2 (pages 2–3) in Schneider; this reference discusses much of the literature on the convex hulls of Minkowski sumsets in its \"Chapter 3 Minkowski addition\" (pages 126–196): \n\nMinkowski sums of convex sets \n\nThe Minkowski sum of two compact convex sets is compact.
