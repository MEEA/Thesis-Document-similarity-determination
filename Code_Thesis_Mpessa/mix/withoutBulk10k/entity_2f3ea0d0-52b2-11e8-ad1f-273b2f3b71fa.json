  "textBody" : "In statistics, the term linear model is used in different ways according to the context. The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model.  However, the term is also used in time series analysis with a different meaning. In each case, the designation \"linear\" is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible.\n\nLinear regression models\n\nFor the regression case, the statistical model is as follows. Given a (random) sample  (Y_i, X_{i1}, \\ldots, X_{ip}), \\, i = 1, \\ldots, n  the relation between the observations Yi and the independent variables Xij is formulated as\n\nY_i \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\phi_1(X_{i1}) + \\cdots + \\beta_p \\phi_p(X_{ip}) + \\varepsilon_i \\qquad i \n 1, \\ldots, n \n\nwhere  \\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_p  may be nonlinear functions.
