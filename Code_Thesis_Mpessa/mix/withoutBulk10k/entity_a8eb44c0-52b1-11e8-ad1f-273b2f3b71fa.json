  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus  of a real number  is the non-negative value of  without regard to its sign. Namely,  for a positive ,  for a negative  (in which case  is positive), and . For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.\n\nGeneralisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example, an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers, the quaternions, ordered rings, fields and vector spaces. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude, distance, and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts.\n\nTerminology and notation\n\nIn 1806, Jean-Robert Argand introduced the term module, meaning unit of measure in French, specifically for the complex absolute value,Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision, June 2008Nahin, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html O'Connor and Robertson], and [http://functions.wolfram.com/ComplexComponents/Abs/35/ functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see Littré, 1877 and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent modulus. The term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in FrenchLazare Nicolas M. Carnot, Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace, p. 105 [https://books.google.com/books?idYyIOAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA105 at Google Books] and 1857 in English.James Mill Peirce, A Text-book of Analytic Geometry [https://books.google.com/books?idRJALAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA42 at Google Books].  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term absolute value is also used in contrast to relative value. The notation , with a vertical bar on each side, was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841.Nicholas J. Higham, Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences, SIAM. , p. 25 Other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude.  In programming languages and computational software packages, the absolute value of x is generally represented by abs(x), or a similar expression.\n\nThe vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts: for example, when applied to a set, it denotes its cardinality; when applied to a matrix, it denotes its determinant.  Vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined, notably an element of a normed division algebra like a real number, complex number, quaternion.  A closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the euclidean norm or sup norm of a vector in \\mathbb{R}^n, although double vertical bars with subscripts (||\\cdot||_2 and ||\\cdot||_\\infty, respectively) are a more common and less ambiguous notation.\n\nDefinition and properties\n\nReal numbers\n\nFor any real number , the absolute value or modulus of  is denoted by  (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity) and is defined asMendelson, [https://books.google.com/books?idA8hAm38zsCMC&pg\nPA2 p. 2].\n\n|x| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     x, & \\text{if }  x \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -x, & \\text{if } x \n\nThe absolute value of  is thus always either positive or zero, but never negative, since  implies .\n\nFrom an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed, the notion of an abstract distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference (see \"Distance\" below).\n\nSince the square root symbol represents the unique positive square root (when applied to a positive number), it follows that\n\n|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}\n\nis equivalent to the definition above, and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers., p. A5\n\nThe absolute value has the following four fundamental properties (a, b are real numbers), that are used for generalization of this notion to other domains:\n\nNon-negativity, positive definiteness, and multiplicativity are readily apparent from the definition.  To see that subadditivity holds, choose \\varepsilon from \\{-1,1\\} so that \\varepsilon(a+b)\\geq 0.   Since \\varepsilon x\\leq |x| for real x regardless of the value of \\varepsilon chosen, subadditivity follows from the calculation |a+b|\\varepsilon(a+b)\n\\varepsilon a +\\varepsilon b\\leq |a|+|b|.  (For a generalization of this argument to complex numbers, see \"Proof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers\" below.)\n\nSome additional useful properties are given below.  These are all implied by the four properties above.\n\nTwo other useful properties concerning inequalities are:\n|a| \\le b \\iff -b \\le a \\le b \n|a| \\ge b \\iff a \\le -b\\  or a\\ge b \n\nThese relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:\n\nThe absolute value, as \"distance from zero\", is used to define the absolute difference between arbitrary real numbers, the standard metric on the real numbers.\n\nComplex numbers\n\nSince the complex numbers are not ordered, the definition given at the top for the real absolute value cannot be directly applied to complex numbers. However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalised. The absolute value of a complex number is defined by the Euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the complex plane from the origin.  This can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem: for any complex number\n\nz = x + iy,\n\nwhere  and  are real numbers, the absolute value or modulus of  is denoted  and is defined by\n\n|z|  \\sqrt{[\\mathrm{Re}(z)]^2 + [\\mathrm{Im}(z)]^2}\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2},\n\nwhere Re(z) x and Im(z) \n y denote the real and imaginary parts of z, respectively.  When the imaginary part  is zero, this coincides with the definition of the absolute value of the real number .\n\nWhen a complex number  is expressed in its polar form as\n\nz = r e^{i \\theta},\n\nwith r = \\sqrt{[\\mathrm{Re}(z)]^2 + [\\mathrm{Im}(z)]^2} \\ge 0 (and  is the argument (or phase) of z), its absolute value is\n\n|z| = r.\n\nSince the product of any complex number  and its complex conjugate \\bar z = x - iy, with the same absolute value, is always the non-negative real number (x^2+y^2), the absolute value of a complex number can be conveniently expressed as\n\n|z| = \\sqrt{z \\cdot \\overline{z}},\n\nresembling the alternative definition for reals: |x| = \\sqrt{x\\cdot x}.\n\nThe complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value.\n\nIn the context of abstract algebra, since the positive real numbers form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, the multiplicative property implies that we may think of absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers..\n\nImportantly, the property of subadditivity (\"triangle inequality\") extends to any finite collection of  complex \n| \\textstyle\\sum_{k1}^n z_k|\\leq\\textstyle\\sum_{k\n1}^n |z_k|.\\quad\\quad (*)\nThis inequality also applies to infinite families, provided that the infinite series \\sum_{k\n1}^\\infty z_k is absolutely convergent.  If (Lebesgue) integration is viewed as the continuous analog of summation, then this inequality is analogously obeyed by complex-valued, measurable functions f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{C} when integrated over a measurable subset E:\n\\Bigg|\\int_E f\\ dx\\Bigg|\\leq\\int_E |f|\\ dx.\n\\quad\\quad(**)\n(This includes Riemann-integrable functions over a bounded interval [a,b] as a special case.)\n\nProof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers \n\nThe triangle inequality, as given by (*), can be demonstrated by applying three easily verified properties of the complex numbers:  Namely, for every complex number z\\in\\mathbb{C},\n(i): there exists  c \\in \\mathbb{C} such that |c|1, |z|\n c\\cdot z, and\n(ii): \\mathrm{Re}(z)\\leq |z|; and also,\n(iii): if (w_k)_{k1}^{\\ell} is a family of complex numbers with a real sum, then this sum \\sum_{k1}^\\ell w_k \n\\sum_{k=1}^\\ell \\mathrm{Re} (w_k).\n\nProof of (*): Choose c such that |c|1 and |\\sum_k z_k|=c (\\sum_k z_k), summed for 1\\leq k\\leq n\\;.  The following computation then affords the desired inequality: \n|\\textstyle\\sum_k z_k|\\; \\overset{(i)} {}\\; c(\\sum_k z_k) \n \\sum_k cz_k\\; \\overset{(iii)} {}\\;\\sum_k\\mathrm{Re}(cz_k)\\; \\overset{(ii)} {\\le}\\; \\sum_k |cz_k| \n \\sum_k |c||z_k| = \\sum_k|z_k|\\;.  \nIt is clear from this proof that equality holds in (*) exactly if all the cz_k are non-negative real numbers, which in turn occurs exactly if all nonzero z_k have the same argument, i.e., z_k=a_k\\zeta for a complex constant \\zeta and real constants a_k \\geq 0 for 1\\le k \\le n.\n\nSince f measurable implies that |f| is also measurable, the proof of the inequality (**) proceeds via the same technique, by replacing \\sum_k with \\int_E dx and z_k with f(x).\n\nAbsolute value function\n\nThe real absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It is differentiable everywhere except for  = 0.  It is monotonically decreasing on the interval  and monotonically increasing on the interval . Since a real number and its opposite have the same absolute value, it is an even function, and is hence not invertible. The real absolute value function is a piecewise linear, convex function.\n\nBoth the real and complex functions are idempotent.\n\nRelationship to the sign function\n\nThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the sign (or signum) function returns a number's sign irrespective of its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions:\n|x| = x \\sgn(x),\nor\n |x| \\sgn(x) = x,\nand for ,\n\\sgn(x) \\frac{x} \n \\frac{x}.\n\nDerivative\n\nThe real absolute value function has a derivative for every , but is not differentiable at . Its derivative for  is given by the step function:[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbsoluteValue.html Weisstein, Eric W. Absolute Value. From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource.]Bartel and Sherbert, p. 163\n\\frac{d|x|}{dx} \\frac{x} \n \\begin{cases} -1 & x0. \\end{cases}\n\nThe subdifferential of  at  is the interval .Peter Wriggers, Panagiotis Panatiotopoulos, eds., New Developments in Contact Problems, 1999, , [https://books.google.com/books?idtiBtC4GmuKcC&pg\nPA31 p. 31–32]\n\nThe complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable nowhere because it violates the Cauchy–Riemann equations.\n\nThe second derivative of  with respect to  is zero everywhere except zero, where it does not exist. As a generalised function, the second derivative may be taken as two times the Dirac delta function.\n\nAntiderivative\n\nThe antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the absolute value function is\n\n\\int|x|dx=\\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,\n\nwhere  is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n\nDistance\n\nThe absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.\n\nThe standard Euclidean distance between two points\n\na = (a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_n) \n\nand\n\nb = (b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_n) \n\nin Euclidean -space is defined as:\n\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}. \n\nThis can be seen as a generalisation, since for a_1 and b_1 real, i.e. in a 1-space, according to the alternative definition of the absolute value,\n\n|a_1 - b_1| \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2} \n \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^1(a_i-b_i)^2},\n\nand for  a a_1 + i a_2  and  b \n b_1 + i b_2  complex numbers, i.e. in a 2-space,\n \n\nThe above shows that the \"absolute value\"-distance, for real and complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance, which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, respectively.\n\nThe properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows:\n\nA real valued function  on a set  is called a metric (or a distance function) on , if it satisfies the following four axioms:These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: .\n\nGeneralizations\n\nOrdered rings\n\nThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring. That is, if  is an element of an ordered ring R, then the absolute value of , denoted by , is defined to be:Mac Lane, [https://books.google.com/books?idL6FENd8GHIUC&pg\nPA264 p. 264].\n\n|a| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     a, & \\text{if }  a \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -a, & \\text{if } a \n\nwhere  is the additive inverse of , 0 is the additive identity element, and Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?ideqUv3Bcd56EC&pg\nPA260 p. 260]. This meaning of valuation is rare. Usually, a valuation is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n\nWhere 0 denotes the additive identity element of . It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativity that , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity element of . The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.\n\nIf  is an absolute value on , then the function  on , defined by , is a metric and the following are equivalent:\n\n*  satisfies the ultrametric inequality d(x, y) \\leq \\max(d(x,z),d(y,z)) for all , ,  in .\n*  \\big\\{ v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big\\}  is bounded in R.\n*  v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) \\le 1\\  for every n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n*  v(a) \\le 1 \\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\le 1\\  for all a \\in F.\n*  v(a + b) \\le \\mathrm{max}\\{v(a), v(b)\\}\\  for all a, b \\in F.\n\nAn absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be non-Archimedean, otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?ideqUv3Bcd56EC&pg\nPA260 pp. 260–261].\n\nVector spaces\n\nAgain the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.\n\nA real-valued function on a vector space  over a field , represented as , is called an absolute value, but more usually a norm, if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\nFor all  in , and ,  in ,\n\nThe norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude.\n\nIn the case of Euclidean space , the function defined by\n\n\\|(x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) \\| \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i\n1}^{n} x_i^2}\n\nis a norm called the Euclidean norm. When the real numbers  are considered as the one-dimensional vector space , the absolute value is a norm, and is the -norm (see Lp space) for any . In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on , in the sense that, for every norm  on , . The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an inner product space. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane .\n\nComposition algebras\n\nEvery composition algebra A has an involution x → x* called its conjugation. The product in A of an element x and its conjugate x* is written N(x) = x x* and called the norm of x.\n\nThe real numbers ℝ, complex numbers ℂ, and quaternions ℍ are all composition algebras with norms given by definite quadratic forms. The absolute value in these division algebras is given by the square root of the composition algebra norm.\n\nIn general the norm of a composition algebra may be a quadratic form that is not definite and has null vectors. However, as in the case of division algebras, when an element x has a non-zero norm, then x has a multiplicative inverse given by x*/N(x).\n\nNotes",

As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.\n\nThe standard Euclidean distance between two points\n\na = (a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_n) \n\nand\n\nb = (b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_n) \n\nin Euclidean -space is defined as:\n\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}. \n\nThis can be seen as a generalisation, since for a_1 and b_1 real, i.e. in a 1-space, according to the alternative definition of the absolute value,\n\n|a_1 - b_1| \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2} \n \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^1(a_i-b_i)^2},\n\nand for  a a_1 + i a_2  and  b \n b_1 + i b_2  complex numbers, i.e. in a 2-space,\n \n\nThe above shows that the \"absolute value\"-distance, for real and complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance, which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, respectively.\n\nThe properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows:\n\nA real valued function  on a set  is called a metric (or a distance function) on , if it satisfies the following four axioms:These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: .\n\nGeneralizations\n\nOrdered rings\n\nThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring. That is, if  is an element of an ordered ring R, then the absolute value of , denoted by , is defined to be:Mac Lane, [https://books.google.com/books?idL6FENd8GHIUC&pg\nPA264 p. 264].\n\n|a| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     a, & \\text{if }  a \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -a, & \\text{if } a \n\nwhere  is the additive inverse of , 0 is the additive identity element, and Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?ideqUv3Bcd56EC&pg\nPA260 p. 260]. This meaning of valuation is rare. Usually, a valuation is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n\nWhere 0 denotes the additive identity element of . It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativity that , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity element of . The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.\n\nIf  is an absolute value on , then the function  on , defined by , is a metric and the following are equivalent:\n\n*  satisfies the ultrametric inequality d(x, y) \\leq \\max(d(x,z),d(y,z)) for all , ,  in .\n*  \\big\\{ v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big\\}  is bounded in R.\n*  v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) \\le 1\\  for every n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n*  v(a) \\le 1 \\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\le 1\\  for all a \\in F.\n*  v(a + b) \\le \\mathrm{max}\\{v(a), v(b)\\}\\  for all a, b \\in F.\n\nAn absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be non-Archimedean, otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?ideqUv3Bcd56EC&pg\nPA260 pp. 260–261].\n\nVector spaces\n\nAgain the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.\n\nA real-valued function on a vector space  over a field , represented as , is called an absolute value, but more usually a norm, if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\nFor all  in , and ,  in ,\n\nThe norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude.\n\nIn the case of Euclidean space , the function defined by\n\n\\|(x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) \\| \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i\n1}^{n} x_i^2}\n\nis a norm called the Euclidean norm. When the real numbers  are considered as the one-dimensional vector space , the absolute value is a norm, and is the -norm (see Lp space) for any . In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on , in the sense that, for every norm  on , . The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an inner product space. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane .\n\nComposition algebras\n\nEvery composition algebra A has an involution x → x* called its conjugation. The product in A of an element x and its conjugate x* is written N(x) = x x* and called the norm of x.\n\nThe real numbers ℝ, complex numbers ℂ, and quaternions ℍ are all composition algebras with norms given by definite quadratic forms. The absolute value in these division algebras is given by the square root of the composition algebra norm.\n\nIn general the norm of a composition algebra may be a quadratic form that is not definite and has null vectors. However, as in the case of division algebras, when an element x has a non-zero norm, then x has a multiplicative inverse given by x*/N(x).\n\nNotes.
