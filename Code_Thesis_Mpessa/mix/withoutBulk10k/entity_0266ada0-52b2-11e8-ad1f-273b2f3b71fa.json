  "textBody" : "Guanine (; or G, Gua) is one of the four main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine.\n\nWith the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar.\n\nProperties\n\nGuanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two tautomeric forms, the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form.\nIt binds to cytosine through three hydrogen bonds. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen bond donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has the C-6 carbonyl group that acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while a group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen bond donors.\n\nGuanine can be hydrolyzed with strong acid to glycine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. First, guanine gets deaminated to become xanthine. Guanine oxidizes more readily than adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350 °C reflects the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 by the German chemist Julius Bodo Unger (1819–1885), who obtained it from the excreta of sea birds, which is known as guano and which was used as a source of fertilizer; guanine was named in 1846.Guanine was first isolated in 1844 by Julius Bodo Unger (1819–1885), a student of Prof. Heinrich Gustav Magnus.

Between 1882 and 1906, Fischer determined the structure and also showed that uric acid can be converted to guanine.\n\nSyntheses\n\nTrace amounts of guanine form by the polymerization of ammonium cyanide (). Two experiments conducted by Levy et al. showed that heating 10 mol·L−1  at 80 °C for 24 hours gave a yield of 0.0007%, while using 0.1 mol·L−1  frozen at −20 °C for 25 years gave a 0.0035% yield. These results indicate guanine could arise in frozen regions of the primitive earth. In 1984, Yuasa reported a 0.00017% yield of guanine after the electrical discharge of , , , and 50 mL of water, followed by a subsequent acid hydrolysis. However, it is unknown whether the presence of guanine was not simply a resultant contaminant of the reaction. - quotes the Yuasa paper and cites the possibility of there being a contaminant in the reaction.\n\n10NH3 + 2CH4 + 4C2H6 + 2H2O → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 25H2\n\nA Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can also be used to form guanine, along with adenine, uracil, and thymine. Heating an equimolar gas mixture of CO, H2, and NH3 to 700 °C for 15 to 24 minutes, followed by quick cooling and then sustained reheating to 100 to 200 °C for 16 to 44 hours with an alumina catalyst, yielded guanine and uracil:\n10CO + H2 + 10NH3 → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 8H2O\n\nAnother possible abiotic route was explored by quenching a 90% N2–10%CO–H2O gas mixture high-temperature plasma.\n\nTraube's synthesis involves heating 2,4,5-triamino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxypyrimidine (as the sulfate) with formic acid for several hours.\n\nOther occurrences/ biological uses\n\nThe word guanine derives from the Spanish loanword guano (\"bird/bat droppings\"), which itself is from the Quechua word wanu, meaning \"dung\". As the Oxford English Dictionary notes, guanine is \"A white amorphous substance obtained abundantly from guano, forming a constituent of the excrement of birds\".OED. \"guanine\" and also \"guano\".\n\nIn 1656 in Paris, a Mr. Jaquin extracted from the scales of the fish Alburnus alburnus so-called \"pearl essence\",Johann Rudolf von Wagner, Ferdinand Fischer, and L. Gautier, Traité de chimie industrielle (Treatise on industrial chemistry), 4th ed., (Paris, France:  Masson & Co., 1903), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?idK2mhGDwiSJsC&pg\nPA64#vonepage&q&f\nfalse pp. 64–65.] which is crystalline guanine.In 1861 the French chemist Charles-Louis Barreswil (1817–1870) found that \"pearl essence\" was guanine.
