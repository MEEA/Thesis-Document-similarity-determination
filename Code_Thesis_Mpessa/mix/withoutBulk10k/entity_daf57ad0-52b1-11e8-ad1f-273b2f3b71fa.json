  "textBody" : "Air   is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and in Western alchemy.\n\nGreek and Roman tradition\n\nAccording to Plato, it is associated with the octahedron; air is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for air: aer meant the dim lower atmosphere, and aether meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, vol. 1, pp. 466, 470–71. Plato, for instance writes that \"So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call aether, the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name....\"Plato, Timaeus, ch. 27, p. 83. Among the early Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers, Anaximenes (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the arche.Guthrie, History of Greek Philosophy, vol. 1, pp. 115–16, 120–32; Jonathan Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, pp. 77–80. A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to Diogenes Apolloniates (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (psyche), but other sources claim that his arche was a substance between air and fire.Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 362–81; Barnes, pp. 289–94. Aristophanes parodied such teachings in his play The Clouds by putting a prayer to air in the mouth of Socrates.\n\nAir was one of many archai proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four archai for his four roots: Air, fire, water, and earth. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name Hera, Aidoneus or even Zeus. Empedocles’ roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy.Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 138–46. Guthrie suggests that Hera is the safest identification for air. Plato (427–347 BCE) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the Timaeus, his major cosmological dialogue, the Platonic solid associated with air is the octahedron which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate.  He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.Plato, Timaeus, chap. 22–23; Gregory Vlastos, Plato’s Universe, pp. 66–82.\n\nPlato's student Aristotle (384–322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the sublunary sphere. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from aether. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed celestial spheres.G. E. R. Lloyd, Aristotle, chapters 7–8.\n\nIn ancient Greek medicine, each of the four humours became associated with an element. Blood was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of spring, since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); hermaphrodite (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.Londa Schiebinger, p. 162.\n\nThe alchemical symbol for air is an upward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.\n\nModern reception\n\nThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings.Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, pp. 154–65. The elemental weapon of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet.Regardie, Golden Dawn, p.322; Kraig, Modern Magick, pp. 149–53. Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of air is Raphael, the angel is Chassan, the ruler is Aral, the king is Paralda, and the air elementals (following Paracelsus) are called sylphs.Regardie, Golden Dawn, p. 80. Air is considerable and it is referred to the upper left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.Regardie, Golden Dawn, pp. 280–286; Kraig, Modern Magick, pp. 206–209. Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.\n\nIn the Golden Dawn and many other magical systems, each element is associated with one of the cardinal points and is placed under the care of guardian Watchtowers. The Watchtowers derive from the Enochian system of magic founded by Dee. In the Golden Dawn, they are represented by the Enochian elemental tablets.Doreen Valiente, The Rebirth of Witchcraft, p. 64. Air is associated with the east, which is guarded by the First Watchtower.Regardie, Golden Dawn, p. 631.\n \nAir is one of the five elements that appear in most Wiccan and Pagan traditions. Wicca in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic and Aleister Crowley's mysticism.Hutton, pp. 216–23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.\n\nParallels in non-Western traditions\n\nIn Hinduism, Vayu (Sanskrit वायु  ), also known as Vāta वात, Pavana पवन (meaning the Purifier),The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 68 or Prāna, is a primary deity, who is the father of Bhima and the spiritual father of Lord Hanuman. As the words for air (Vāyu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the Panchamahābhuta the \"five great elements\" in Hinduism. \n\nAir is not one of the traditional five Chinese classical elements.  Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of Qi or chi is believed to be close to that of air. Qi (; spelled qì in Pinyin romanization and ch'i4 in Wade-Giles) or ki (in Japanese romanization), is a fundamental concept of traditional Chinese culture. Qi is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of \"life force\" or \"spiritual energy\". It is frequently translated as \"energy flow\", or literally as \"air\" or \"breath\". (For example, \"tiānqì\", literally \"sky breath\", is the ordinary Chinese word for \"weather\"). In Mandarin Chinese it is pronounced something like \"chee\" in English, but the tongue position is different.  (See Media:Difficult Sounds.GIF.) The concept of qi is often reified, however no scientific evidence supports its existence.\n\nThe element air also appears as a concept in the Buddhist philosophy which has an ancient history in China.\n\nSome Western modern occultists equate the Chinese classical element of metal with air,Donald Michael Kraig, Modern Magick, p. 115. others with wood due to the elemental association of wind and wood in the bagua.\n\nEnlil was the god of air in ancient Sumer. Shu was the ancient Egyptian deity of air and the husband of Tefnut, goddess of moisture. He became an emblem of strength by virtue of his role in separating Nut from Geb. Shu played a primary role in the Coffin Texts, which were spells intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely. On the way to the sky, the spirit had to travel through the air as one spell indicates: \"I have gone up in Shu, I have climbed on the sunbeams.\"Bob Brier, Ancient Egyptian Magic, p.128.",
