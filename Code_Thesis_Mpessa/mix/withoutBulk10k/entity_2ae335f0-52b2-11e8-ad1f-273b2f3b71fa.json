His exploits have earned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the parody religion kibology, centered on the humor newsgroup alt.religion.kibology.\n\nBackground\n\nJames Parry grew up and lived in Scotia, New York. He showed early computing skills, such as being able to open up and reprogram ROM video game cartridges such as those for the Atari 2600, but was more interested in graphics and artistic pursuits. In this vein, he was initially a computer engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, but moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1990 and attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider. He developed several fonts in use today. One of his better known works is the typography for Philip K. Dick's novel \"Gather Yourselves Together.\"\n\nGrowing fame\n\nIn the early 1990s, as public awareness grew of the Internet and Usenet, Parry received publicity, including a cover story in Wired magazine mentions in Playboy and Time magazine, and appearances in such publications as The Times.\n\nHe became known on Usenet for grepping all occurrences of the term \"Kibo\"—whether intended to refer to Kibo himself or not—and replying, often in a fanciful manner.
