  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative.  While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place.  The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued.\n\nLike the derivative, the gradient represents the slope of the tangent of the graph of the function. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. The components of the gradient in coordinates are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the tangent space to the graph.  This characterizing property of the gradient allows it to be defined independently of a choice of coordinate system, as a vector field whose components in a coordinate system will transform when going from one coordinate system to another.\n\nThe Jacobian is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds.  A further generalization for a function between Banach spaces is the Fréchet derivative.\n\nMotivation\n\nConsider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field, , so at each point  the temperature is . (Assume that the temperature does not change over time.) At each point in the room, the gradient of  at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly. The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.\n\nConsider a surface whose height above sea level at point  is . The gradient of  at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.\n\nThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. If a road goes directly up the hill, then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40%. If, instead, the road goes around the hill at an angle, then it will have a shallower slope. For example, if the angle between the road and the uphill direction, projected onto the horizontal plane, is 60°, then the steepest slope along the road will be 20%, which is 40% times the cosine of 60°.\n\nThis observation can be mathematically stated as follows. If the hill height function  is differentiable, then the gradient of  dotted with a unit vector gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector. More precisely, when  is differentiable, the dot product of the gradient of  with a given unit vector is equal to the directional derivative of  in the direction of that unit vector.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe gradient (or gradient vector field) of a scalar function  is denoted  or   where  (the nabla symbol) denotes the vector differential operator, del. The notation  is also commonly used for the gradient. The gradient of  is defined as the unique vector field whose dot product with any unit vector  at each point  is the directional derivative of  along . That is,\n\n\\big(\\nabla f(x)\\big)\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = D_{\\mathbf v}f(x).\n\nWhen a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see Spatial gradient).\n\nCartesian coordinates\n\nIn the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with a Euclidean metric, the gradient, if it exists, is given by:\n\n\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\mathbf{k}\n\nwhere , ,  are the standard unit vectors in the directions of the ,  and  coordinates, respectively. For example, the gradient of the function\nf(x,y,z)= 2x+3y^2-\\sin(z)\nis\n \\nabla f = 2\\mathbf{i}+ 6y\\mathbf{j} -\\cos(z)\\mathbf{k}. \n\nIn some applications it is customary to represent the gradient as a row vector or column vector of its components in a rectangular coordinate system.\n\nCylindrical and spherical coordinates\n\nIn cylindrical coordinates with a Euclidean metric, the gradient is given by:.\n\n\\nabla f(\\rho, \\varphi, z) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\rho}\\mathbf{e}_\\rho + \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varphi}\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\mathbf{e}_z\n\nwhere  is the azimuthal or azimuth angle,  is the axial coordinate, and ,  and  are unit vectors pointing along the coordinate directions.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the gradient is given by:\n\n\\nabla f(r, \\theta, \\varphi) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\mathbf{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r \\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varphi}\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi\n\nwhere  is the azimuth angle and  is the zenith angle, and ,  and  are again local unit vectors pointing in the coordinate directions (i.e. the normalized  covariant basis).\n\nFor the gradient in other orthogonal coordinate systems, see Orthogonal coordinates (Differential operators in three dimensions).\n\nGeneral coordinates\n\nUsing Einstein notation we can consider the gradient in  general coordinates, which we write as , where  is the number of dimensions of the domain. Here, the upper index refers to the number of the coordinate or component, so  refers to the second component, and not the quantity  squared. The index variable  is used to refer to an arbitrary element, such as . The gradient can then be written as:\n\n\\nabla f \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}\\mathbf{e}^i \n  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}g^{ij} \\mathbf{e}_j  ,\n\nwhere \\mathbf{e}^i and \\mathbf{e}_j\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial x^j}\\right) refer to the unnormalized local  contravariant and covariant bases respectively, g^{ij} is the inverse metric tensor, and the Einstein summation convention implies summation over i  and j. In terms of the normalized bases, which we refer to as \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}^i and \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_j, using the identities \\lVert \\mathbf{e}^i  \\rVert\n\\sqrt{g^{ii}} and  \\lVert \\mathbf{e}_j  \\rVert=\\sqrt{g_{jj}}, we can write:\n\n\\nabla f \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}\\sqrt{g^{ii}}\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}^i \n  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} g^{ij} \\sqrt{g_{jj}}\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_j,\n\nwhich will evaluate to the expressions given above for cylindrical and spherical coordinates.\n\nGradient and the derivative or differential\n\nLinear approximation to a function\n\nThe gradient of a function  from the Euclidean space  to  at any particular point  in  characterizes the best linear approximation to  at . The approximation is as follows:\n\n f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + (\\nabla f)_{x_0}\\cdot(x-x_0) \n\nfor  close to , where  is the gradient of  computed at , and the dot denotes the dot product on . This equation is equivalent to the first two terms in the multivariable Taylor series expansion of  at .\n\nDifferential or (exterior) derivative\n\nThe best linear approximation to a differentiable function\nf: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\nat a point  in  is a linear map from  to  which is often denoted by  or  and called the differential or (total) derivative of  at . The gradient is therefore related to the differential by the formula\n (\\nabla f)_x\\cdot v = \\mathrm{d} f_x(v)\nfor any . The function , which maps  to , is called the differential or exterior derivative of  and is an example of a differential 1-form.\n\nIf  is viewed as the space of (dimension ) column vectors (of real numbers), then one can regard  as the row vector with components\n \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\right) \nso that  is given by matrix multiplication.  Assuming the standard Euclidean metric on , the gradient is then the corresponding column vector, i.e.,\n(\\nabla f)_i = \\mathrm{d} f^\\mathsf{T}_i.\n\nGradient as a derivative\n\nLet  be an open set in . If the function  is differentiable, then the differential of  is the (Fréchet) derivative of . Thus  is a function from  to the space  such that\n\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\|f(x+h)-f(x) -\\nabla f(x)\\cdot h\\|}{\\|h\\|} = 0\nwhere · is the dot product.\n\nAs a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient:\n\nLinearity\n\nThe gradient is linear in the sense that if  and  are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point , and  and  are two constants, then  is differentiable at , and moreover\n\\nabla\\left(\\alpha f+\\beta g\\right)(a) = \\alpha \\nabla f(a) + \\beta\\nabla g (a).\n\nProduct rule\n\nIf  and  are real-valued functions differentiable at a point , then the product rule asserts that the product  is differentiable at , and\n\\nabla (fg)(a) = f(a)\\nabla g(a) + g(a)\\nabla f(a).\n\nChain rule\n\nSuppose that  is a real-valued function defined on a subset  of , and that  is differentiable at a point . There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function  is a parametric curve; that is, a function  maps a subset  into . If  is differentiable at a point  such that , then\n(f\\circ g)'(c) = \\nabla f(a)\\cdot g'(c),\nwhere ∘ is the composition operator: .\n\nMore generally, if instead , then the following holds:\n\\nabla (f\\circ g)(c) = \\big(Dg(c)\\big)^\\mathsf{T} \\big(\\nabla f(a)\\big)\nwhere T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.\n\nFor the second form of the chain rule, suppose that  is a real valued function on a subset  of , and that  is differentiable at the point . Then\n\\nabla (h\\circ f)(a) = h'\\big(f(a)\\big)\\nabla f(a).\n\nFurther properties and applications\n\nLevel sets\n\nA level surface, or isosurface, is the set of all points where some function has a given value.\n\nIf  is differentiable, then the dot product  of the gradient at a point  with a vector  gives the directional derivative of  at  in the direction . It follows that in this case the gradient of  is orthogonal to the level sets of . For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form . The gradient of  is then normal to the surface.\n\nMore generally, any embedded hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form  such that  is nowhere zero. The gradient of  is then normal to the hypersurface.\n\nSimilarly, an affine algebraic hypersurface may be defined by an equation , where  is a polynomial. The gradient of  is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.\n\nConservative vector fields and the gradient theorem\n\nThe gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a conservative vector field: its line integral along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the gradient theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nGradient of a vector\n\nSince the total derivative of a vector field is a linear mapping from vectors to vectors, it is a tensor quantity.\n\nIn rectangular coordinates, the gradient of a vector field  is defined by:\n\n\\nabla \\mathbf{f}=g^{jk}\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j} \\mathbf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_k\n\nwhere the Einstein summation notation is used and the tensor product of the vectors  and  is a dyadic tensor of type (2,0), or the transpose of the Jacobian matrix\n\n\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j} = \\frac{\\partial (f^1,f^2,f^3)}{\\partial (x^1,x^2,x^3)}.\n\nIn curvilinear coordinates, or more generally on a curved manifold, the gradient involves Christoffel symbols:\n\n\\nabla \\mathbf{f}=g^{jk}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f^i}{\\partial x^j}+{\\Gamma^i}_{jl}f^l\\right) \\mathbf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_k\n\nwhere  are the components of the inverse metric tensor and the  are the coordinate basis vectors.\n\nExpressed more invariantly, the gradient of a vector field  can be defined by the Levi-Civita connection and metric tensor:.\n\n\\nabla^a f^b = g^{ac} \\nabla_c f^b ,\n\nwhere  is the connection.\nRiemannian manifolds\n\nFor any smooth function  on a Riemannian manifold , the gradient of  is the vector field  such that for any vector field ,\ng(\\nabla f, X) \\partial_X f, \\qquad \\text{i.e.,}\\quad g_x\\big((\\nabla f)_x, X_x \\big) \n (\\partial_X f) (x)\nwhere  denotes the inner product of tangent vectors at  defined by the metric  and  is the function that takes any point  to the directional derivative of  in the direction , evaluated at . In other words, in a coordinate chart  from an open subset of  to an open subset of ,  is given by:\n\\sum_{j=1}^n X^{j} \\big(\\varphi(x)\\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}}(f \\circ \\varphi^{-1}) \\Bigg|_{\\varphi(x)}\nwhere  denotes the th component of  in this coordinate chart.\n\nSo, the local form of the gradient takes the form:\n\n \\nabla f = g^{ik} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k} {\\textbf e}_i .\n\nGeneralizing the case , the gradient of a function is related to its exterior derivative, since\n(\\partial_X f) (x) = (df)_x(X_x) .\nMore precisely, the gradient  is the vector field associated to the differential 1-form  using the musical isomorphism\n\\sharp=\\sharp^g\\colon T^*M\\to TM\n(called \"sharp\") defined by the metric . The relation between the exterior derivative and the gradient of a function on  is a special case of this in which the metric is the flat metric given by the dot product.",
