  "textBody" : "G (named gee)The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. 1976. is the 7th letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.\n\nHistory\n\nThe letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of 'C' to distinguish voiced from voiceless. The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, who taught around 230 BC. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both and before open vowels, had come to express in all environments.\n\nRuga's positioning of 'G' shows that alphabetic order related to the letters' values as Greek numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the Roman censor Appius Claudius, who found it distasteful and foreign.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/zed.html Encyclopaedia Romana] Sampson (1985) suggests that: \"Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by the dropping of an old letter.\"[http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html Evertype.com]\n\nGeorge Hempl (1899) proposes that there never was such a \"space\" in the alphabet and that in fact 'G' was a direct descendant of zeta.  Zeta took shapes like ‚äè in some of the Old Italic scripts; the development of the monumental form 'G' from this shape would be exactly parallel to the development of 'C' from gamma.  He suggests that the pronunciation > was due to contamination from the also similar-looking 'K'.\n\nEventually, both velar consonants and developed palatalized allophones before front vowels; consequently in today's Romance languages,  and  have different sound values depending on context (known as hard and soft C and hard and soft G).  Because of French influence, English orthography shares this feature.\n\nTypographic variants\n\nThe modern lowercase 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-storey (sometimes opentail)  and the double-storey (sometimes looptail) . The single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop, thus closing the loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey form (g) had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed bowl or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper closed bowl. The double-storey version became popular when printing switched to \"Roman type\" because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an \"ear\".\n\nGenerally, the two forms are complementary, but occasionally the difference has been exploited to provide contrast. The 1949 Principles of the International Phonetic Association recommends using  for advanced voiced velar plosives (denoted by Latin small letter script G) and  for regular ones where the two are contrasted, but this suggestion was never accepted by phoneticians in general, and today  is the symbol used in the International Phonetic Alphabet, with  acknowledged as an acceptable variant and more often used in printed materials.\n\nUse in writing systems\n\nEnglish\n\nIn English, the letter appears either alone or in some digraphs.  Alone, it represents\n* a voiced velar plosive ( or \"hard\" ), as in goose, gargoyle and game;\n* a voiced palato-alveolar affricate ( or \"soft\" ), generally before  or , as in giant, ginger and geology; or\n* a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant in some words of French origin, such as rouge, beige and genre.\n\nIn words of Romance origin,  is mainly soft before  (including the digraphs  and ), , or , and hard otherwise.\nThere are many English words of non-Romance origin where  is hard though followed by  or  (e.g. get, gift), and a few in which  is soft though followed by  such as gaol or margarine.\n\nThe double consonant  has the value (hard ) as in nugget, with very few exceptions: in suggest and in exaggerate and veggies.\n\nThe digraph  has the value (soft ), as in badger.
