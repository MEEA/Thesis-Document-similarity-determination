  "textBody" : "The politics of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (commonly known as Laos) takes place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic. The only legal political party is the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). The de jure head of state is President Bounnhang Vorachith, who also is LPRP general secretary making him the de facto leader of Laos.\n\nThe head of government is Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith. Government policies are determined by the party through the all-powerful nine-member Politburo of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the 49-member Central Committee. Important government decisions are vetted by the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe FY 2000 central government budget plan called for revenue of $180 million and expenditures of $289 million, including capital expenditures of $202 million.\n\nPolitical culture \n\nLaos' first, French-written and monarchical constitution was promulgated on May 11, 1947 and declared it to be an independent state within the French Union. The revised constitution of May 11, 1957, omitted reference to the French Union, though close educational, health and technical ties with the former colonial power persisted. The 1957 document was abrogated on December 3, 1975, when a communist People's Republic was proclaimed.\n\nA new constitution was adopted in 1991 and enshrined a \"leading role\" for the LPRP. The following year, elections were held for a new 85-seat National Assembly with members elected by secret ballot to five-year terms. This National Assembly, which essentially acts as a rubber stamp for the LPRP, approves all new laws, although the executive branch retains authority to issue binding decrees.\n\nThe most recent elections took place in April 2006. The assembly was expanded to 99 members in 1997 and in 2006 elections had 115.\n\nInsurgency \n\nIn the early 2000s, bomb attacks against the government occurred, coupled with small exchanges of fire, across Laos.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/859457.stm A variety of different groups have claimed responsibility including the Committee for Independence and Democracy in Laos and Lao Citizens Movement for Democracy.\n\nExecutive branch\n\n|President\n|Bounnhang Vorachith\n|Lao People's Revolutionary Party\n|20 April 2016\n|-\n|Prime Minister\n|Thongloun Sisoulith\n|Lao People's Revolutionary Party\n|20 April 2016\n|}\nThe president is elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term. The prime minister and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the president with the approval of the National Assembly for a five-year term.\n\nThere are also four deputy prime ministers.
