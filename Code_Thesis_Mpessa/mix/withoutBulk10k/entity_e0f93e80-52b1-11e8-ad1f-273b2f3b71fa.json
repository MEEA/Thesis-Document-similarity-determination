  "textBody" : "Chauvinism is a form of extreme patriotism and a  belief in national superiority and glory. Whereas patriotism and nationalism may represent temperate pride, chauvinism is \nintemperate. It can be also defined as \"an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people\". Moreover, the chauvinist's own people are seen as unique and special while the rest of the people are considered weak or inferior.\n\nAccording to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic wars. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical Bonapartist despite the unpopularity of this view in Bourbon Restoration France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.\n\nChauvinism has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs,  especially when such partisanship includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition. This French quality finds its parallel in the British term jingoism, which has retained the meaning of chauvinism strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism.\n\nIn modern English, the word has come to be used in some quarters as shorthand for male chauvinism, a trend reflected in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, which begins its third example of use of the term chauvinism with \"an attitude that the members of your own sex are always better than those of the opposite sex\".\n\nAs nationalism\n\nIn 1945, political theorist Hannah Arendt described the concept thus:\n\nMale chauvinism\n\nMale chauvinism is the belief that men are superior to women. The first documented use of the phrase \"male chauvinism\" is in the 1935 Clifford Odets play Till the Day I Die.\n\nIn the workplace\n\nThe balance of the workforce changed during World War II through the dramatic rise of women’s participation as men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war. After the war ended and men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employment, but women had stepped into many of their positions to fill the void, says Lloyd.Lloyd, Cynthia B., ed. Sex, Discrimination, and the Division of Labor. New York: Columbia University Press, 1975. Print.\n\nLloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominantly holding positions of power, and women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.Michael Korda, Male Chauvinism! How It Works. New York: Random House, 1973. Print.\n\nCauses\n\nChauvinism is seen by some as an influential factor in the TAT, a psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the \"potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation\" for women.Potkay, Charles R., Matthew R. Merrens. Sources of Male Chauvinism in the TAT. Journal of Personality Assessment, 39.5 (1975): 471-479. Web. 31 Jan 2012.\n\nAn often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.\n\nFemale chauvinism\n\nThe term female chauvinism has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of feminism; second-wave feminist Betty Friedan is a notable example.\"If I were a man, I would strenuously object to the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class. This is [...] female chauvinism.\" Friedan, Betty. 1998. It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement. Harvard University Press Ariel Levy used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, Female Chauvinist Pigs, in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older misogynist stereotypes.Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture, Ariel Levy, 2006,",
