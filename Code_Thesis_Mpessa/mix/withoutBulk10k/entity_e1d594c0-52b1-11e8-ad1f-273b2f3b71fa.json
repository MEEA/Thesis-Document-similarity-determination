His mother's father, also called Cuitlahuac, had been ruler of Iztapalapa,Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 42–43. and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially.Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 50–51.\n\nConflict with Spain\n\nCuitláhuac was made tlatoani of Tenochtitlan during the Spanish conquest of Mexico; After Pedro de Alvarado had ordered the Massacre in the Great Temple, the Aztecs were very upset and started to fight and put a siege to the Spaniards. Hernán Cortés ordered Moctezuma to ask his people to stop fighting. Moctezuma told him that they would not listen to him and suggested Cortés free Cuitláhuac so that he could convince them to dispose of their arms and not fight anymore. Cortés then freed Cuitláhuac and once Cuitláhuac was free he led his people against the conquistadors. He succeeded and the Spaniards were driven out of Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520. Cuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten- or eleven-year-old girl who later was called Isabel Moctezuma.Chipman, Donald E. (2005).

His elder brother Matlatzincatzin, who had been cihuacoatl (\"president\"), resigned upon Cuitláhuac's death.Probably from Chimalpahin (1997); broken reference.
