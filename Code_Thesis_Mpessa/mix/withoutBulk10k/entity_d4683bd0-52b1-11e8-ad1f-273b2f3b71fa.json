  "textBody" : "Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.\n\nTechniques\n\nProcess overview \n\nThe process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose.  This may be governed by regulation, contract,  technical specifications or other published standards.  Engineering judgment may include such factors as:\n* The precision and accuracy of measurement and the associated uncertainty of measurement.\n* The statistical confidence interval or tolerance interval of the initial measurement.\n* The number of significant figures of the measurement.\n* The intended use of the measurement including the engineering tolerances.\n* Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g., international foot vs. US survey foot.\n\nSome conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement. This is sometimes called soft conversion. It does not involve changing the physical configuration of the item being measured.\n\nBy contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion  may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item. Nominal values are sometimes allowed and used.\n\nConversion factors \n\nA conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value. The unity bracket method of unit conversion consists of a fraction in which the denominator is equal to the numerator, but they are in different units.  Because of the identity property of multiplication, the value of a number will not change as long as it is multiplied by one. Also, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal to each other, then the fraction is equal to one. So as long as the numerator and denominator of the fraction are equivalent, they will not affect the value of the measured quantity.\n\nSoftware tools \n\nThere are many conversion tools. They are found in the function libraries of applications such as spreadsheets databases, in calculators, and in macro packages and plugins for many other applications such as the mathematical, scientific and technical applications.\n\nThere are many standalone applications that offer the thousands of the various units with conversions.  For example, the free software movement offers a command line utility [https://www.gnu.org/software/units/ GNU units] for Linux and Windows.\n\nTables of conversion factors \n\nThis article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit. Conversions between units in the metric system are defined by their prefixes (for example, 1 kilogram 1000 grams, 1 milligram \n 0.001 grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10−6 metre). Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the SI units (base or derived) are highlighted.\n\nLength\n\nArea\n\nVolume\n\nPlane angle\n\nSolid angle",
