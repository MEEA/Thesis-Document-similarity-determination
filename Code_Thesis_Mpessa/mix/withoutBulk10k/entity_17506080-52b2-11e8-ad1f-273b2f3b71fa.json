Both command-line and graphical versions were available.\n\nXChat is available for Unix-like systems; derivatives with native support for macOS's Aqua interface are also available (see below).\n\nXChat's main source code tree has not received any patches since 2013.[http://sourceforge.net/p/xchat/svn/HEAD/tree/ XChat Subversion repository history], showing few commits other than to plug-in code since 2010 Some Linux distributions, such as Fedora, maintain their own versions to fix bugs, keep the program working and able to build, and to resolve security issues. A fork known as HexChat, formerly the Windows-specific X-Chat WDK, is still maintained, by October 2016[https://hexchat.github.io/news.html HexChat News].\n\nFeatures\n\nXChat is a full-featured Internet Relay Chat client with a graphical user interface surrounding the basic chat window. It includes all basic functionality found in most other IRC clients, including nick completion, connecting to multiple servers,IRC Hacks, p. 90. secure connections,IRC Hacks, p. 93. Client-to-client protocol, Direct Client-to-Client file transfers and chats, and a plugin system for various programming languages (including at least C or C++, Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby,[http://xchat-ruby.sourceforge.net/ Xchat-Ruby Plugin Website]. ruby.sourceforge.net Lua,[http://ankh-morp.org/~vetinari/projects/xchat-lua/ xchat Lua plugin]. ankh-morp.org.

Plugins allow extending the features and customization of the functionality of XChat.\n\nThe default view for the client window is referred to as \"tree view\", but can be configured for a tabbed interface instead. Tabs change color as text arrives, other users enter or leave channels, or another user addresses the user's nickname. The interface can display clickable operator (\"op\") commands and others, and allows customization of fonts, event sounds, timestamps, and logging.Arnote, Paul (September 2009). [http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/200909/page07.html \"Internet Relay Chat: The Forgotten Chat Frontier\"]. PCLinuxOS Magazine.

However, on August 23, 2004, the official build for Windows had become shareware, and had to be purchased after a 30-day trial period. Previous builds for Windows were removed from the official site.
