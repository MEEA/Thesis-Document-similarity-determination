The terms \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1796 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.\n\nJenner is often called \"the father of immunology\", and his work is said to have \"saved more lives than the work of any other human\". In Jenner’s time, smallpox killed around 10 percent of the population, with the number as high as 20 percent in towns and cities where infection spread more easily.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/edward-jenner-discovers-the-smallpox-vaccine/ \"How did Edward Jenner test his smallpox vaccine?\"]. Telegraph. Retrieved 2 December 2017 In 1821 he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. A member of the  Royal Society, in the field of zoology he was the first person to describe the brood parasitism of the cuckoo. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.\n\nEarly life\n\nEdward Anthony Jenner was born on 17 May 1749 (6 May Old Style) in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the vicar of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.\n\nHe went to school in Wotton-under-Edge and Cirencester. During the time, he was inoculated for smallpox, which had a lifelong effect upon his general health. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.\n\nIn 1770, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon John Hunter and others at St George's Hospital. William Osler records that Hunter gave Jenner William Harvey's advice, very famous in medical circles (and characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment), \"Don't think; try.\" Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over natural history and proposed him for the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley.\n\nJenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough (in Gloucestershire), meeting to dine together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on cowpox. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id7135&inst_id\n8 \"Papers at the Royal College of Physicians summarised\"].\n\nHe became a master mason on  30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449.

In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774, but it was not until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success.  A similar observation had also been made in France by Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier in 1780.\n\nNoting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox.\n\nOn 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating James Phipps, an eight-year-old boy who was the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom, whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St George's medical school library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on vaccination.[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files\n1556742&pageno=13 An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, Edward Jenner]. Retrieved 17 November 2012\n\nJenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected Phipps with variolous material, the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection.\n\nDonald Hopkins has written, \"Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle. Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.\n\nJenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolationthe use of smallpox to induce immunityand provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge. (See Vaccination acts).\n\nThe success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and was used en masse in the Spanish Balmis Expedition, a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, led by Dr. Francisco Javier de Balmis with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine. The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote, \"I don’t imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this.\"\"Andean Studies: New Trends and Library Resources : Papers of the Forty-Fifth Annual Meeting of the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials\", University of California, Los Angeles ... 27–31 May 2000\". p. 46 Napoleon, who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, and at the request of Jenner he released English prisoners of war and permitted their return home.

Rutgers University Press\n\nLater life \n\nIn 1803 in London, he became president of the Jennerian Society, concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate smallpox. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 122–5. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the Royal Society of Medicine) and presented several papers there. Jenner was also elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1802, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806.\n\nReturning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his \"Observations on the Migration of Birds\" to the Royal Society.\n\nDeath \n\nJenner was found in a state of apoplexy on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He never fully recovered and eventually died of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was buried in the Jenner family vault at the Church of St. Mary's, Berkeley, Gloucestershire.

This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/08/smallpox-vials-found-cardboard-box-maryland-laboratory \"Forgotten smallpox vials found in cardboard box at Maryland laboratory\"].

Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolationthe use of smallpox to induce immunityand provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge. (See Vaccination acts).\n\nThe success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and was used en masse in the Spanish Balmis Expedition, a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, led by Dr. Francisco Javier de Balmis with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine. The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote, \"I don’t imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this.\"\"Andean Studies: New Trends and Library Resources : Papers of the Forty-Fifth Annual Meeting of the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials\", University of California, Los Angeles ... 27–31 May 2000\". p. 46 Napoleon, who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, and at the request of Jenner he released English prisoners of war and permitted their return home. Napoleon remarked he could not \"refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind.\"\"Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Volumes 9-11. p. 297. Royal Society of London, 1952\n\nJenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and the King in petitioning Parliament,[https://books.google.com/books?idxpFIAQAAMAAJ&pg\nPA176&lpgPA176&dq\nDr+John+Griffiths,+surgeon+to++st+George%27s+Hospital&sourcebl&ots\nRXN6sKdiBg&sigFsSl_KTQOG0HPtnB0ndFEOvHXF0&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwiHzOz3maTRAhWGJZQKHYCIC-8Q6AEINTAI#vonepage&q\nDr%20John%20Griffiths%2C%20surgeon%20to%20%20st%20George's%20Hospital&ffalse REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS: VOL.

In 1807, he was granted another £20,000 after the Royal College of Physicians confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.J. N. Hays (2009). \"The Burdens of Disease: Epidemics and Human Response in Western History\". p. 126. Rutgers University Press\n\nLater life \n\nIn 1803 in London, he became president of the Jennerian Society, concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate smallpox. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 122–5. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the Royal Society of Medicine) and presented several papers there. Jenner was also elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1802, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806.\n\nReturning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his \"Observations on the Migration of Birds\" to the Royal Society.\n\nDeath \n\nJenner was found in a state of apoplexy on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He never fully recovered and eventually died of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was buried in the Jenner family vault at the Church of St. Mary's, Berkeley, Gloucestershire. Jenner was survived by one son and one daughter, his elder son having died of tuberculosis aged 21.Darren R. Flower (2008). \"Bioinformatics for Vaccinology\". p. 28.

See pages 141, 179, 221, 282, 295, 317, 416, 447–448 Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: \"I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which he has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures.\"Nolie Mumey, Edward Jenner; 1949. Vaccination: bicentenary of the birth of Edward Jenner, Volume 1. Range Press, p. 37\nHowever, his contemporary Rabbi Israel Lipschitz in his classic commentary on the Mishna Tiferet Yisrael wrote that Jenner was one of the \"righteous of the nations,\" deserving a lofty place in the World to Come, for having saved millions of people from smallpox. Tiferet Yisrael (Boaz) on Avot 3:14\n\nLegacy \n\nIn 1979, the World Health Organization declared smallpox an eradicated disease. This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/08/smallpox-vials-found-cardboard-box-maryland-laboratory \"Forgotten smallpox vials found in cardboard box at Maryland laboratory\"].

In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. The lunar crater Jenner is named in his honour.
