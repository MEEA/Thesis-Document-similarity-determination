  "textBody" : "In mathematics, an identity element or neutral element is a special type of element of a set with respect to a binary operation on that set, which leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them. This concept is used in algebraic structures such as groups and rings. The term identity element is often shortened to identity (as will be done in this article) when there is no possibility of confusion, however, the identity implicitly depends on the binary operation it is coupled with. \n\nLet  be a set  with a binary operation ∗ on it.
