  "textBody" : "A film festival is an organized, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors. Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., film noir) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals). A number of film festivals specialise in short films of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians, including Jerry Beck, do not consider film festivals official releases of film.\n\nThe most prestigious film festivals in the world are generally considered to be Cannes, Berlin, and Venice. These festivals are sometimes called the \"Big Three.\" The Toronto International Film Festival is North America's most popular festival in terms of attendance; Time wrote it had \"grown from its place as the most influential fall film festival to the most influential film festival, period.\" The Venice Film Festival is the oldest major festival in the world.\n\nHistory\n\nVenice held the first major film festival in 1932.

Raindance Film Festival is the UK's largest celebration of independent film-making, and takes place in London in October.\n\nMainland Europe's biggest independent film festival is ÉCU The European Independent Film Festival, that started at 2006 and takes place every spring in Paris, France.\n\nAustralia's first and longest running film festival is the Melbourne International Film Festival (1952), followed by the Sydney Film Festival (1954).  Edinburgh International Film Festival is the longest running festival in Great Britain.\n\nNorth America's first and longest running short film festival is the Yorkton Film Festival, established in 1947. The first film festival in the United States was the Columbus International Film & Video Festival, also known as The Chris Awards, held in 1953. According to the Film Arts Foundation in San Francisco, \"The Chris Awards (is) one of the most prestigious documentary, educational, business and informational competitions in the U.S; (it is) the oldest of its kind in North America and celebrating its 54th year.\" It was followed four years later by the San Francisco International Film Festival, held in March 1957, which emphasized feature-length dramatic films. The festival played a major role in introducing foreign films to American audiences. Films in the first year included Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali.\n\nToday, thousands of film festivals take place around the world—from high-profile festivals such as Sundance Film Festival and Slamdance Film Festival (Park City, Utah), to horror festivals such as Terror Film Festival (Philadelphia), and the Park City Film Music Festival, the first U.S. film festival dedicated to honoring music in film.\n\nFilm Funding competitions such as Writers and Filmmakers were introduced when the cost of production could be lowered significantly and internet technology allowed for the collaboration of film production.\n\nFestival administration \n\nBusiness Model \n\nAlthough there are notable for-profit festivals such as SXSW, most festivals operate on a nonprofit membership-based model, with a combination of ticket sales, membership fees, and corporate sponsorship constituting the majority of revenue. Unlike other arts nonprofits (performing arts, museums, etc.), film festivals typically receive few donations from the general public and are occasionally organized as nonprofit business associations instead of public charities. Film industry members often have significant curatorial input, and corporate sponsors are given opportunities to promote their brand to festival audiences in exchange for cash contributions. Private parties, often to raise investments for film projects, constitute significant \"fringe\" events. Larger festivals maintain year-round staffs often engaging in community and charitable projects outside festival season.\n\nEntry fee \n\nWhile entries from established filmmakers are usually considered pluses by the organizers, most festivals require new or relatively unknown filmmakers to pay an entry fee to have their works considered for screening. This is especially so in larger film festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, South by Southwest, Montreal World Film Festival, and even smaller \"boutique\" festivals such as the Miami International Film Festival, British Urban Film Festival in London and Mumbai Women's International Film Festival in India.\n\nOn the other hand, some festivals—usually those accepting fewer films, and perhaps not attracting as many \"big names\" in their audiences as do Sundance and Telluride—require no entry fee. Rotterdam Film Festival, Mumbai Film Festival, and many smaller film festivals in the United States (the Stony Brook Film Festival on Long Island, the Northwest Filmmakers' Festival, and the Sicilian Film Festival in Miami), are examples.\n \nThe Portland International Film Festival charges an entry fee, but waives it for filmmakers from the Northwestern United States, and some others with regional focuses have similar approaches.\n\nSeveral film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers' entries into multiple festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient \"describe once, submit many\" service. Examples include Withoutabox, Film Freeway, Reelport, FestHome and Film Festival Life.\n\nScreening out of competition \n\nThe core tradition of film festivals is competition, that is, the consideration of films with the intention of judging which are most deserving of various forms of recognition. In contrast to those films, some festivals may screen (i.e., project onto a movie screen before an audience) some films without treating them as part of the competition; the films are said to be \"screened out...\" (or \"outside...\") \"of competition\".\n\nNotable festivals \n\nThe three most prestigious film festivals are generally considered to be Cannes, Berlin, and Venice. These festivals are sometimes called the \"Big Three.\" Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski's The Three Colors Trilogy were each made for these festivals, with Blue for Venice, White for Berlin, and Red for Cannes.\n\nThe Toronto International Film Festival is North America's most popular festival. Time wrote it had \"grown from its place as the most influential fall film festival to the most influential film festival, period.\" Seattle International Film Festival is credited as being the largest film festival in the USA, regularly showing over 400 films in a month across the city. The Sundance Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Austin Film Festival, New York Film Festival, Montreal World Film Festival, Regina international film festival and awards (RIFFA) and Vancouver International Film Festival are also major North American festivals.\n\nCompetitive feature film \n\nThe festivals in Berlin, Cairo, Cannes, Goa, Karlovy Vary, Locarno, Mar del Plata, Montreal, Moscow, San Sebastián, Shanghai, Tallinn, Tokyo, Venice, and Warsaw are accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF) in the category of competitive feature films.\n\nExperimental films \n\nAnn Arbor Film Festival started in 1963. It is the oldest continually operated experimental film festival in North America, and has become one of the premiere film festivals for independent and, primarily, experimental filmmakers to showcase work.\n\nIndependent films \n\nIn the US, Telluride Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival,[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FILM_SUNDANCE_ROBERT_REDFORD_GENT-?SITEWIFON&SECTION\nHOME&TEMPLATEDEFAULT Redford Says Sundance Maintains Essence][http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FILM_SUNDANCE?SITE\nTNNAT&SECTIONENTERTAINMENT&TEMPLATE\nDEFAULT Filmmakers look to Sundance buying spree] Austin Film Festival, Austin's South by Southwest, New York City's Tribeca Film Festival and Slamdance Film Festival are all considered significant festivals for independent film.
