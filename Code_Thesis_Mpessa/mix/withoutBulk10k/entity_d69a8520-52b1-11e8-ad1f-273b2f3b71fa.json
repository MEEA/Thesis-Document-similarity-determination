  "textBody" : "British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated three adages that are known as Clarke's three laws, of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited:\n\n# When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\n# The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.\n# Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nOrigins \n\nAll three laws appear in Clarke's essay \"Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination\", first published in Profiles of the Future (1962).\"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'\" in the collection Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.\n\nClarke's first law was proposed by Clarke in the 1962 edition of the essay, as \"Clarke's Law\".\n\nThe second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay. Its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. In the 1973 revision of Profiles of the Future, Clarke acknowledged it as his second law and proposed the third, writing \"As three laws were good enough for Newton, I have modestly decided to stop there\".\n\nThe third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the \"Hazards of Prophecy\" essay. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by Leigh Brackett: \"Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned\".\"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon\", Astounding February 1942, p. 39. Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in Wild Talents (1932) by Charles Fort: \"...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic,\" and in the short story The Hound of Death (1933) by Agatha Christie: \"The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood.\"\n\nClarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he \"would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic\", referring to his memory of \"seeing and hearing Linotype machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’\".\n\nProposed fourth law \n\nA fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws.
