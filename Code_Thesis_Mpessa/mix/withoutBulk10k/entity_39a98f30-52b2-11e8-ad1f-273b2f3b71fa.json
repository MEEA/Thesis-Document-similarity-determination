  "textBody" : "The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (Berber: Idwasen Urbiben Igeldanen n Murakuc; Arabic: القوات المسلحة الملكية المغربية, Al-Quwwat al-Musallaha al-Malakiyah al-Maghribiyah) are the military forces of the Kingdom of Morocco. They consist of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Royal Gendarmerie، and the Royal Guard\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Armed Forces are large, expensive and well-trained with extensive experience in counter-insurgency, desert warfare and combined air-land operations. Further experience has come from participating in peace-keeping operations.IISS 2013, pp. 394 However, as Morocco has not fought a conventional interstate war since the Algerian-Moroccan war of 1963, they have little experience in state-on-state warfare.\n\nBut this force still faces many challenges. The U.S. Embassy in Rabat commented in 2008 that: \"The military remains plagued by corruption, an inefficient bureaucracy, low levels of education in the ranks, periodic threats of radicalization of some of its soldiers, political marginalization, and the deployment of most of its forces in Western Sahara\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe Moroccan army has existed continuously since the rising of Almoravid Empire in the 11th-century. During the protectorates period (1912–1956),[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html CIA World Factbook] large numbers of Moroccans were recruited for service in the Spahi and Tirailleur regiments of the French Army of Africa (French: Armée d'Afrique). Many served during World War I. During World War II more than 300,000 Moroccan troops (including goumier auxiliaries) served with the Free French forces in North Africa, Italy, France and Austria. The two world conflicts saw Moroccan units earning the nickname of \"Todesschwalben\" (death swallows) by German soldiers as they showed particular toughness on the battlefield. After the end of World War II, Moroccan troops formed part of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps engaged in the First Indochina War from 1946 to 1954.\n\nThe Spanish Army also made extensive use of Moroccan troops recruited in the Spanish Protectorate, during both the Rif War of 1921–26 and the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. Moroccan Regulares, together with the Spanish Legion, made up Spain's elite Spanish Army of Africa. A para-military gendarmerie, known as the \"Mehal-la Jalifianas\" and modelled on the French goumieres, was employed within the Spanish Zone.\n\nThe Royal Armed Forces were created on 14 May 1956, after the French Protectorate was dissolved. 14,000 Moroccan personnel from the French Army and 10,000 from the Spanish Armed Forces transferred into the newly formed armed forces, this number was augmented by approximately 5,000 former guerrillas from the \"Army of Liberation\", About 2,000 French officers and NCOs remained in Morocco on short term contracts until the training programs at the military academies of St-Cyr, Toledo and Dar al Bayda produced sufficient numbers of Moroccan commissioned officers.\n\nFour years later, the Royal Moroccan Navy was established in 1960.\n\nThe Moroccan military first Engagement as an independent country in the 20th century was the border war of 1963 with Algeria,[https://web.archive.org/web/20071112110043/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893782,00.html Ifni & After], Time Magazine, December 16, 1957[http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/algmor1963.htm Algerian-Moroccan War 1963] - onwar.com In the early 1960s, Moroccan troops were sent to the Congo as part of the first multifunctional UN peacekeeping operation ONUC, The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces fought on the Golan front during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 (mostly in the battle for Quneitra) and intervened decisively in the 1977 conflict known as Shaba I to save Zaire's regime.[http://www.lse.ac.uk/IDEAS/programmes/africaProgramme/events/conferences/africaCWMay2829/papers_pdfs/powell.pdf The “Cuba of the West:” France and Mobutu’s Zaïre, 1977-1979 ][http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/5829/CIA-RDP79T00975A030700010040-6.pdf National Intelligence Daily (Cable) : 5 June 1978 ][http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/5829/CIA-RDP79T00975A030900010092-7.pdf National Intelligence Daily (Cable), 27 novembre 1978 ] After Shaba II, Morocco was part of the Inter-African Force deployed on the Zaire border, contributing about 1,500 troops. The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces also took a symbolic part in the Gulf War among other Arab armies.\n\nBut the Moroccan Armed Forces were mostly notable in fighting a 16-year war against the POLISARIO,[http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/papa/polisario1975.htm The Sahara War 1975-1991] - onwar.com an Algerian backed rebel national liberation movement seeking the independence of Western Sahara from Morocco, from the mid-1980s Morocco largely managed to keep POLISARIO troops off by building a huge sand wall, staffed by an army roughly the same size as the entire Sahrawi population, enclosing within it the economically useful parts of Western Sahara (Bou Craa, El-Aaiun, Smara etc.). This stalemated the war, with no side able to achieve decisive gains, but artillery strikes and sniping attacks by the guerrillas continued, and Morocco was economically and politically strained by the war.[http://newint.org/features/1997/12/05/facts WESTERN SAHARA - THE FACTS]\n\nIn the 1990s, Moroccan troops went to Angola with the three UN Angola Verifications Missions, UNAVEM I, UNAVEM II, and UNAVEM III.
