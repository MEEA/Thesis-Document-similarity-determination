  "textBody" : "The history of science and technology (HST) is a field of history which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it (technology) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.\n\nHistories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with William Whewell, as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the Soviet historian Boris Hessen, was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After World War II, extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by Thomas Kuhn, the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of science studies.\n\nModern engineering as it is understood today took form during the scientific revolution, though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the Greeks, Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Chinese, Indians. See the main articles History of science and History of technology for these respective topics.\n\nUniversities with HST programs \n\nArgentina \n\n* Buenos Aires Institute of Technology, Argentina, has been offering courses on History of the Technology and the Science.\n* National Technological University, Argentina, has a complete history program on its offered careers.\n\nAustralia \n\n* The University of Sydney offers both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the History and Philosophy of Science, run by the Unit for the History and Philosophy of Science, within the Science Faculty. Undergraduate coursework can be completed as part of either a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts Degree.  Undergraduate study can be furthered by completing an additional Honours year. For postgraduate study, the Unit offers both coursework and research based degrees. The two course-work based postgraduate degrees are the Graduate Certificate in Science (HPS) and the Graduate Diploma in Science (HPS). The two research based postgraduate degrees are a Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).\n\nBelgium \n\n* University of Liège, has a Department called Centre d'histoire des Sciences et Techniques.\n\nCanada \n\n* Carleton University Ottawa offer courses in Ancient Science and Technology in its Technology, Society and Environment program.\n* University of Toronto has a program in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.\n* University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a History of Science and Technology Program.\n\nFrance \n\n* Nantes University has a dedicated Department called [http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cfv/ Centre François Viète].\n* Paris Diderot University (Paris 7) has a Department of History and Philosophy of Science.\n* A CNRS research center in History and Philosophy of Science [http://www.sphere.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique48 SPHERE], affiliated with Paris Diderot University, has a dedicated [http://www.rehseis.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article958 history of technology] section.\n* Pantheon-Sorbonne University (Paris 1)  has a dedicated [http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/ Institute of History and Philosophy of Science and Technics].\n* The École Normale Supérieure de Paris has a history of science Department.\n\nGermany \n\n* Technische Universität Berlin, has a program in the History of Science and Technology.\n\nGreece \n\n* The University of Athens has a Department of Philosophy and History of Science [http://www.phs.uoa.gr/node.php?nhome&lang\nen]\n\nIndia \n\nHistory of science and technology is a well developed field in India.

Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.Nathan Reingold, \"History of Science Today, 1.
