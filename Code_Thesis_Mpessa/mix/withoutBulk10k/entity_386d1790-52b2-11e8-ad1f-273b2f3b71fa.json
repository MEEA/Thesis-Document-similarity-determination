  "textBody" : "“Spam” is a Monty Python sketch, first televised in 1970 and written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin. In the sketch, two customers are lowered by wires into a greasy spoon café and try to order a breakfast from a menu that includes Spam in almost every dish, much to the consternation of one of the customers.\n\nThe televised sketch and several subsequent performances feature Terry Jones as the Waitress, Eric Idle as Mr. Bun and Graham Chapman as Mrs. Bun, who does not like Spam. The original sketch also featured John Cleese as The Hungarian and Michael Palin as a historian, but this part was left out of the audio version of the sketch recorded for the team's second album Another Monty Python Record in 1971. A year later this track was released as the Pythons' first 7\" single.\n\nThe term spam in the context of electronic communications is derived from this sketch.\n\nPlot\n\nThe three-and-a-half-minute sketch is set in the fictional Green Midget Café in Bromley. An argument develops between the waitress, who recites a menu in which nearly every dish contains Spam (among them, \"Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce, garnished with truffle pâté, brandy and a fried egg on top and Spam\"), and Mrs Bun, who does not like Spam. She asks for a dish without Spam, much to the amazement of her Spam-loving husband. The waitress responds to this request with disgust.\n\nAt several points, a group of Vikings in the restaurant interrupts conversation by loudly singing \"Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam.\" The irate waitress orders them to shut up, but they resume singing more loudly. A Hungarian tourist comes to the counter, trying to order by using a wholly inaccurate Hungarian/English phrasebook (a reference to a previous sketch). He is rapidly escorted away by a police constable.\n\nThe sketch abruptly cuts to a historian in a television studio talking about the origin of the Vikings in the café. As he goes on, he begins to increasingly insert the word \"Spam\" into every sentence (\"...and Spam selecting a Spam particular Spam item from the Spam menu, would Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam...\"), and the backdrop is raised to reveal the restaurant set behind. The historian joins the Vikings, Mr. and Mrs. Bun are lifted by wires out of the scene, and the singing continues. In the original televised performance, the closing credits begin to scroll with the singing still audible in the background.\n\nProduction notes\n\nThe sketch premiered on 15 December 1970 as the final sketch of the 25th show of Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the end credits for the episode were changed so every member of the crew has either Spam or some other food item from the menu added to their names. (Spam Terry Jones, Michael Spam Palin, John Spam John Spam John Spam Cleese, Graham Spam Spam Spam Chapman, Eric Spam Egg and Chips Idle, Terry Spam Sausage Spam Egg Spam Gilliam, etc.) The sketch became immensely popular. The word \"Spam\" is uttered at least 132 times.\n\nThis sketch has also been featured in several Monty Python videos including Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python. A lead sheet for the song appears in Monty Python's Big Red Book.\n\nThe DVD release of the episode contains a deliberate subtitling error. When the Hungarian tries to order food, his words are \"My lower intestine is full of Spam, Egg, Spam, Bacon, Spam, Tomatoes, Spam.\" Yet the subtitles read \"Your intestine is full of Sperm.\"  This is a continuation of the \"Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook\" sketch from the same episode.\n\nThe audio version of the sketch excludes the Hungarian and historian, and instead has the Vikings reaching a dramatic crescendo. The waitress, resigned to these disruptions, mutters \"Bloody Vikings!\" In the 2014 version of the sketch performed in Monty Python Live (Mostly), one of the Vikings replies \"Racist bastard!\" before leading the group into an operatic chorus that includes a sampling of \"Finland\" from the team's Contractual Obligation Album.\n\nSpam was a popular food during World War II in the UK. Although rationed, it was generally easily available and not subject to supply shortages, as were other meats. Thanks to its wartime ubiquity, the British grew heartily tired of it.How We Lived Then: A History of Everyday Life in the Second World War, Norman Longmate, Arrow Books, 1971, pp 142, 159\n\nMenu\n\n*Egg and bacon\n*Egg, sausage and bacon\n*Egg and Spam\n*Egg, bacon and Spam\n*Egg, bacon, sausage and Spam\n*Spam, bacon, sausage and Spam\n*Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam\n*Spam, Spam, Spam, egg and Spam \n* Spam, Sausage, Spam, Spam, Spam, Bacon, Spam, Tomato and Spam (vinyl record)\n*Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam\n*Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce, garnished with truffle pâté, brandy and a fried egg on top, and Spam.
