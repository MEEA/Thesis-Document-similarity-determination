  "textBody" : "Data compression ratio, also known as compression power, is a computer science term used to quantify the reduction in data-representation size produced by a data compression algorithm.  The data compression ratio is analogous to the physical compression ratio used to measure physical compression of substances.\n\nDefinitions\n\nData compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the uncompressed size and compressed size:\n\n {\\rm Compression\\;Ratio} = \\frac{\\rm Uncompressed\\;Size}{\\rm Compressed\\;Size}\n\nThus a representation that compresses a 10 MB file to 2 MB has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, often notated as an explicit ratio, 5:1 (read \"five\" to \"one\"), or as an implicit ratio, 5/1.
