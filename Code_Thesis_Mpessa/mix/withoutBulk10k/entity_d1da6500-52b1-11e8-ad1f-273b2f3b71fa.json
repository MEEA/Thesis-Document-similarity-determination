  "textBody" : "Bjørn Lomborg (; born 6 January 1965) is a Danish author and visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School as well as President of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. He is former director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI) in Copenhagen. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, The Skeptical Environmentalist (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world’s rising temperature.\n\nIn 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus, a project-based conference where prominent economists sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of welfare economics.\n\nIn 2009, Business Insider cited Lomborg as one of \"The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics\". While Lomborg campaigned against the Kyoto Protocol and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions. His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Lomborg stated: \"Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat.\"  In 2011 and 2012, Lomborg was named a Top 100 Global Thinker by Foreign Policy \"for looking more right than ever on the politics of climate change\".\n\nEducation \n\nLomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the University of Georgia, earned an M.A. degree in political science at the University of Aarhus in 1991, and a Ph.D. degree in political science at the University of Copenhagen in 1994.\n\nCareer \n\nLomborg lectured in statistics in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an assistant professor (1994–1996) and associate professor (1997–2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, Copenhagen Business School.\n\nEarly in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in collective action dilemmas, simulation of party behavior in proportional voting systems, and the use of surveys in public administration. In 1996, Lomborg's paper, \"Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\", was published in the academic journal, American Sociological Review.\n\nLater, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the environmental arena. In 1998, Lomborg published four essays about the state of the environment in the leading Danish newspaper Politiken, which according to him \"resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers.\"[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006. This led to the Skeptical Environmentalist, whose English translation was published as a work in environmental economics by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited Global Crises, Global Solutions, which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.\n\nIn March 2002, the newly elected center-right prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.\n\nLomborg has created several short videos for the prominent educational website Prager University, an unaccredited conservative Institute, founded by talk show host, Dennis Prager. His videos focus on environmental science.https://www.prageru.com/courses/environmental-science/paris-climate-agreement-wont-change-climate\n\nCopenhagen Consensus\n\n \nLomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by The Economist. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, Global Crises, Global Solutions, edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference. Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure. Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States. The Center was based out of a \"Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center\" in Lowell, Massachusetts, though Lomborg himself was based in Prague in the Czech Republic. In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as \"a little more than $1m a year...from private donations\", of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.\n\nIn April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the University of Western Australia would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the Center's goals as a \"focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.\". This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer. Reports indicated that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation. $4 million of the total funding for the Center was to be provided by the Australian federal government, with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.\n\nOn 8 May 2015 UWA cancelled the contract for hosting the Australian Consensus Centre as \"the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support\". The Australian federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, said that he would find another university to host the ACC.\n\nIn July 2015, Flinders University senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union) and Scott Ludlam. The story appeared the next day in The Australian,http://www.theaustralian.com.au%2Fhigher-education%2Fflinders-university-in-talks-on-lomborg-plan-for-consensus-centre%2Fstory-e6frgcjx-1227454548253&eiozG6VcjWJ8bSmgWw6KvoCQ&usg\nAFQjCNGScfDFWZ9hjaxigevHK4rWVHnApQ&sig2U5gRecjvhTphXhmr6Zq7Mg&bvm\nbv.99028883,d.dGY but described as \"academic conversations\" with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg’s involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University.http://blogs.flinders.edu.au/flinders-news/2015/07/24/statement-from-the-vice-chancellor-on-current-academic-discussions/ The following week, a story appeared in the Guardian quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff’s withering rejection of the idea. Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg, citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition and 350.org launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.\n\nOn 21 October 2015 education minister Simon Birmingham told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn. It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.\n\nThe Skeptical Environmentalist \n\nIn 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing The Skeptical Environmentalist, a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.\n\nIn the chapter on climate change in The Skeptical Environmentalist, he states: \"This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible\". Cost–benefit analyses, calculated by the Copenhagen Consensus, ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004. \"Optimal carbon tax,\" \"The Kyoto Protocol,\" and \"Value-at-risk carbon tax\" ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad. In a 2010 interview with the New Statesman, Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: \"Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.\"\n\nFormal accusations of scientific dishonesty \n\nAfter the publication of The Skeptical Environmentalist, Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD), a body under Denmark's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a \"debate\" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges claimed that The Skeptical Environmentalist contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.\n\nIn January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question.[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008. That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.\n\nResponse of the academic community \n\nThe original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a petition[https://web.archive.org/web/20030117223212/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm \"Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed\"]. Retrieved 28 July 2015. signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.[http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2002 Annual Report] . Retrieved 13 February 2008. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and natural sciences community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.\n\nRecognition \n\nThe alumni network of the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL) voted The Skeptical Environmentalist among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.\n\nContinued debate and criticism \n\nThe rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.\n\nThe Lomborg Deception, a book by Howard Friel, claims to offer a \"careful analysis\" of the ways in which Lomborg has \"selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence\",Philip Kitcher. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5983/1230-a.pdf The Climate Change Debates] Science, Vol. 328, 4 June 2010, p. 1232. and that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public response. Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument response.http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf   Friel has written a reply to this response, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.\n\nA group of scientists, Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the Journal of Information Ethics,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250207154_On_the_Opposition_Against_the_Book_The_Skeptical_Environmentalist_by_B_Lomborg in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.\n\nThe claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of Journal of Information Ethics by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called \"the Galileo hypothesis\", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called \"a history of misrepresenting\" climate science.\n\nIn 2014 the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4 million to establish a \"consensus centre\" with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed the decision and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution. On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn. (For further details see the \"Copenhagen Consensus\" sub-section of the \"Career\" section, above.)\n\nLomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that \"a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich\"...making fossil fuel so \"inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming\". In publications such as the Wall Street Journal he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nPersonal life \n\nLomborg is gay and a vegetarian. As a public figure he has been a participant in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that \"Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie yuppies on the direction floor, as well as everything in between\". - translated.\n\nRecognitions and awards \n\n* The Global Leaders of Tomorrow (Class 2002) - World Economic Forum (2002)\n* The Stars of Europe (category: Agenda Setters) - BusinessWeek (17 Jun 2002): \"No matter what they think of his views, nobody denies that Bjorn Lomborg has shaken the environmental movement to its core.\"\n* The 2004 TIME 100 (in Scientists & Thinkers) - TIME (26 Apr 2004): \"Our list of the most influential people in the world today: He just might be the Martin Luther of the environmental movement.\"\n* Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll (#14) Foreign Policy and Prospect Magazine(2005)\n* Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll (#41) Foreign Policy and Prospect Magazine (2008)\n* 50 people who could save the planet - The Guardian (5 Jan 2008)\n* Glocal Hero Award - Transatlantyk - Poznań International Film and Music Festival (2011)\n* FP Top 100 Global Thinkers - Foreign Policy (2012): \"For taking the black and white out of climate politics\"\n\nDiscussions in the media \n\nAfter the release of The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the media, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international mass media. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and print media around the world.\n* Scientific American published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own website, quoting the article at such length that Scientific American threatened to sue for copyright infringement. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in PDF format on Scientific Americans site.[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF \"Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)\"].

Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg, citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition and 350.org launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.\n\nOn 21 October 2015 education minister Simon Birmingham told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn. It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.\n\nThe Skeptical Environmentalist \n\nIn 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing The Skeptical Environmentalist, a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.\n\nIn the chapter on climate change in The Skeptical Environmentalist, he states: \"This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible\". Cost–benefit analyses, calculated by the Copenhagen Consensus, ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004. \"Optimal carbon tax,\" \"The Kyoto Protocol,\" and \"Value-at-risk carbon tax\" ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad. In a 2010 interview with the New Statesman, Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: \"Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.\"\n\nFormal accusations of scientific dishonesty \n\nAfter the publication of The Skeptical Environmentalist, Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD), a body under Denmark's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a \"debate\" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges claimed that The Skeptical Environmentalist contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.\n\nIn January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question.[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008. That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.\n\nResponse of the academic community \n\nThe original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a petition[https://web.archive.org/web/20030117223212/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm \"Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed\"]. Retrieved 28 July 2015. signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.[http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2002 Annual Report] . Retrieved 13 February 2008. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and natural sciences community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.\n\nRecognition \n\nThe alumni network of the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL) voted The Skeptical Environmentalist among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.\n\nContinued debate and criticism \n\nThe rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.\n\nThe Lomborg Deception, a book by Howard Friel, claims to offer a \"careful analysis\" of the ways in which Lomborg has \"selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence\",Philip Kitcher. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5983/1230-a.pdf The Climate Change Debates] Science, Vol. 328, 4 June 2010, p. 1232. and that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public response. Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument response.http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf   Friel has written a reply to this response, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.\n\nA group of scientists, Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the Journal of Information Ethics,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250207154_On_the_Opposition_Against_the_Book_The_Skeptical_Environmentalist_by_B_Lomborg in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.\n\nThe claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of Journal of Information Ethics by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called \"the Galileo hypothesis\", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called \"a history of misrepresenting\" climate science.\n\nIn 2014 the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4 million to establish a \"consensus centre\" with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed the decision and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution. On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn. (For further details see the \"Copenhagen Consensus\" sub-section of the \"Career\" section, above.)\n\nLomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that \"a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich\"...making fossil fuel so \"inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming\". In publications such as the Wall Street Journal he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nPersonal life \n\nLomborg is gay and a vegetarian. As a public figure he has been a participant in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that \"Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie yuppies on the direction floor, as well as everything in between\". - translated.\n\nRecognitions and awards \n\n* The Global Leaders of Tomorrow (Class 2002) - World Economic Forum (2002)\n* The Stars of Europe (category: Agenda Setters) - BusinessWeek (17 Jun 2002): \"No matter what they think of his views, nobody denies that Bjorn Lomborg has shaken the environmental movement to its core.\"\n* The 2004 TIME 100 (in Scientists & Thinkers) - TIME (26 Apr 2004): \"Our list of the most influential people in the world today: He just might be the Martin Luther of the environmental movement.\"\n* Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll (#14) Foreign Policy and Prospect Magazine(2005)\n* Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll (#41) Foreign Policy and Prospect Magazine (2008)\n* 50 people who could save the planet - The Guardian (5 Jan 2008)\n* Glocal Hero Award - Transatlantyk - Poznań International Film and Music Festival (2011)\n* FP Top 100 Global Thinkers - Foreign Policy (2012): \"For taking the black and white out of climate politics\"\n\nDiscussions in the media \n\nAfter the release of The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the media, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international mass media. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and print media around the world.\n* Scientific American published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own website, quoting the article at such length that Scientific American threatened to sue for copyright infringement. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in PDF format on Scientific Americans site.[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF \"Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)\"].
