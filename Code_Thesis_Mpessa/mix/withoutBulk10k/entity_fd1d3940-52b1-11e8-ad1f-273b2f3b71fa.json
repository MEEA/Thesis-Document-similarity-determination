  "textBody" : "Functional theories of grammar are those approaches to the study of language that see functionality of language and its elements to be the key to understanding linguistic processes and structures. Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from structural linguistics or formalist language theories, in that the latter approaches seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other only as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former additionally takes into account the context where linguistic elements are used and studies the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment. This  means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used in communicative context. The formal relations between linguistic elements are assumed to be functionally-motivated.\n\nFrameworks\n\nThere are several distinct grammatical frameworks that employ a functional approach.\n\n*The structuralist functionalism of the Prague school was the earliest functionalist framework developed in the 1920s.Newmeyer, Frederick. (2001). The Prague School and North American functionalist approaches to syntax. Journal of Linguistics vol. 37. 101 - 126Novak, P., Sgall, P. 1968. On the Prague functional approach. Trav. Ling.

Martinet is one of the most famous French linguists and can be regarded as the father of French functionalism.\n*Simon Dik's Functional Grammar, originally developed in the 1970s and 80s, has been influential and inspired many other functional theories.Dik, S. C. 1980. Studies in Functional Grammar. London: AcademicDik, S. C. 1981. Functional Grammar. Dordrecht/Cinnaminson NJ: Foris.
