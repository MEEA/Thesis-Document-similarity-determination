  "textBody" : "The Degree Confluence Project is a World Wide Web-based, all-volunteer project which aims to have people visit each of the integer degree intersections of latitude and longitude on Earth, posting photographs and a narrative of each visit online. The project describes itself as \"an organized sampling of the world\".\n\nRequirements\n\nThe precise location of each degree confluence uses the WGS 84 horizontal datum, and visitors to degree confluences almost always make use of GPS receivers. For a successful visit, the visitor must get within 100 metres of the confluence point, and post a narrative and several photographs to the project website. A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an incomplete visit. The project encourages visits to degree confluences which have been visited previously, and many confluence points in North America and Europe have been visited several times.\n\nThe total number of degree confluences is 64,442,Latitude lines 89°N to 89°S (179), multiplied by 360° of longitude (360), plus the two poles (2) 179 × 360 + 2 \n 64,442. of which 21,543 are on land, 38,409 on water, and 4,490 on the Antarctic and Arctic ice caps.[http://www.confluence.org/infoconf.php#location Classifications as of August 4, 2007] The project categorizes degree confluences as either primary or secondary. A confluence is primary only if it is on land or within sight of land. In addition, at latitudes greater than 48o only some points are designated primary because confluences crowd together near the poles.[http://www.confluence.org/infoconf.php#poles Poles Problem] Both primary and secondary confluences may be visited and recorded.\n\nIn addition the visits of special geographical locations can also be reported (special visits) as there are\n\n* center of the world ( 0° 78°27'08\"W )\n* center of continents\n* Royal Greenwich Observatory \n* etc.\n\nHistory \n\nThe project was started by Alex Jarrett in February 1996 because he \"liked the idea of visiting a location represented by a round number such as 43°00'00\"N 72°00'00\"W.
