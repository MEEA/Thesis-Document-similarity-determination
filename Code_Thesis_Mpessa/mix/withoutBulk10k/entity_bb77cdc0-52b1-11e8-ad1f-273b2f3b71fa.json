  "textBody" : "Anaxagoras (; , Anaxagoras, \"lord of the assembly\";  BC) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. Born in Clazomenae at a time when Asia Minor was under the control of the Persian Empire (modern-day Urla, Turkey). Anaxagoras was the first to bring philosophy to Athens (reference needed). According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch, in later life he was charged with impiety and went into exile in Lampsacus; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with Pericles, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.\n\nResponding to the claims of Parmenides on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, \"each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it\". He introduced the concept of Nous (Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was homogeneous, or nearly so.\n\nHe also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for eclipses and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the Peloponnese, as well as attempting to explain rainbows and meteors.\n\nBiography\n\nAnaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of Clazomenae, in Asia Minor. However, he supposedly surrendered this out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge. The Roman author Valerius Maximus preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: \"If this had not perished, I would have\"—a sentence described by Valerius as being \"possessed of sought-after wisdom!\"Val.

There he is said to have remained for thirty years. Pericles learned to love and admire him, and the poet Euripides derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.\n\nAnaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from Ionia to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of meteorites led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a meteorite in 467.Couprie, Dirk L. \"How Thales Was Able to\" Predict\" a Solar Eclipse Without the Help of Alleged Mesopotamian Wisdom.\" Early Science and Medicine 9.4 (2004): 321-337 He attempted to give a scientific account of eclipses, meteors, rainbows, and the sun, which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the Peloponnese. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaxagoras/ Anaxagoras biography] He thought the earth was flat and floated supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes caused earthquakes.Burnet J.
