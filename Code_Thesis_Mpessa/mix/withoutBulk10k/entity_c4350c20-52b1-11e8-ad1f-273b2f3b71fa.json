  "textBody" : "Andrew Stuart Tanenbaum (born March 16, 1944), sometimes referred to by the handle ast, is an American-Dutch computer scientist and professor emeritus of computer science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. \n\nHe is best known as the author of MINIX, a free Unix-like operating system for teaching purposes, and for his computer science textbooks, regarded as standard texts in the field. He regards his teaching job as his most important work.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/followup/ 2004 article] about Linux, the Usenet debate, and the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution Since 2004 he has operated Electoral-vote.com, a website dedicated to analysis of polling data in federal elections in the United States.\n\nBiography\n\nTanenbaum was born in New York City and grew up in suburban White Plains, New York. He is Jewish.http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/khorostkov/khorostkov.html His paternal grandfather was born in Khorostkiv in the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nHe received his bachelor of Science degree in Physics from MIT in 1965 and  his Ph.D. degree in astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971. Tanenbaum also served as a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.\n\nHe moved to the Netherlands to live with his wife, who is Dutch, but he retains his United States citizenship. He teaches courses about Computer Organization and Operating Systems and supervises the work of Ph.D. candidates at the VU University Amsterdam. On , he announced his retirement.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/tanenbaum Retirement of Prof. Andy Tanenbaum]  \n\nTeaching\n\nBooks\n\nTanenbaum is well recognized for his textbooks on computer science. They include:\n* Computer Networks, co-authored with David J. Wetherall  (1st ed. 1981, 2nd ed. 1988, 3rd ed. 1996, 4th ed. 2002, 5th ed. 2010)\n* Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, co-authored with Albert Woodhull\n* Modern Operating Systems\n* Distributed Operating Systems\n* Structured Computer Organization\n* Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, co-authored with Maarten van Steen\n\nHis book, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation and MINIX were Linus Torvalds' inspiration for the Linux kernel. In his autobiography Just for Fun, Torvalds describes it as \"the book that launched me to new heights\".\n\nHis books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/home/faq.html Andrew S. Tanenbaum's FAQ] They have appeared in over 175 editions and are used at universities around the world.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications]  \n\nDoctoral students\n\nTanenbaum has had a number of Ph.D. students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.\nThese include:\n* Henri Bal, a professor at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam\n* Frans Kaashoek, a professor at MIT\n* Sape Mullender, a researcher at Bell Labs\n* Robbert van Renesse, a professor at Cornell University\n* Leendert van Doorn, a distinguished engineer at the Microsoft Corporation\n* Werner Vogels, the Chief Technology Officer at Amazon.com\n\nDean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Delft University of Technology, and Leiden University. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\nProjects\n\nAmsterdam Compiler Kit\n\nThe Amsterdam Compiler Kit is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  \n\nMINIX\n\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of UNIX, called MINIX (MINi-unIX), for the IBM PC. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books] The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a Usenet newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own (POSIX like) kernel, called Linux, which originally used the MINIX file system, but it is not based on MINIX code.[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  \n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06] The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a microkernel, with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.[http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit] The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. MINIX 3, as the current version is called, is available under the BSD license for free.\n\nResearch projects\n\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a postdoctoral researcher. These projects include:\n* Amoeba\n* Globe\n* Mansion\n* Orca\n* Paramecium\n* RFID Guardian\n* Turtle F2F\n\nElectoral-vote.com\n\nIn 2004, Tanenbaum created Electoral-vote.com, a web site analyzing opinion polls for the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election, using them to project the outcome in the Electoral College. He stated that he created the site as an American who \"knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.\" The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as \"the Votemaster\" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred John Kerry. A libertarian who supports the Democrats, he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.\n\nThrough the site he also covered the 2006 midterm elections, correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.\n\nFor the 2008 elections, he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by Norm Coleman over Al Franken. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were Colorado and Nevada.\n\nTanenbaum–Torvalds debate\n\nThe Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on Usenet in 1992.[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D \"LINUX is obsolete\" Usenet Debate Text]\n\nAwards\n\n* Fellow of the ACM\n* Fellow of the IEEE\n* Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994)\n* Eurosys Lifetime Achievement Award, 2015\n* Honorary doctorate from Petru Maior University, Targu Mures, Romania, 2011\n* Winner of the TAA McGuffey award for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems, 2010\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the LADC Conference, 2009\n* Winner of a 2.5 million euro European Research Council Advanced Grant, 2008\n* USENIX Flame Award 2008 [http://www.usenix.org/about/flame.html USENIX Flame Award] for his many contributions to systems design and to openness both in discussion and in source\n* Honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the Real-Time and Network Systems Conf., 2008\n* Winner of the 2007 IEEE James H.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din Târgu Mureș (Petru Maior University of Târgu Mureș) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\nKeynote talks\n\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* Codemotion 2015  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010] Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* FOSDEM Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09] Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Informática] of the Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* NLUUG [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* linux.conf.au in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005",
