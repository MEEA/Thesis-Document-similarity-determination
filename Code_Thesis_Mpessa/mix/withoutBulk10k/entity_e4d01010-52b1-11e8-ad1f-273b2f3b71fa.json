With the same definition, the most common countries of origin were Poland, Turkey, Germany, Iraq, Romania, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia and its successor states.\nMore than 752 618 individuals (13.1%) are migrants and their descendants (146 798 second generation migrants born in Denmark).\n\nOf these 752 618 immigrants and their descendants:\n* 267 606 (36%) have a Western background (Norway, Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina, UK, Poland and Iceland; definition: EU countries, non-EU Nordic countries, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland, Vatican State, Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand.).\n* 485 012 (64%) have a non-Western background (Turkey, Iraq, Romani, Somalia, Pakistan, Iran and Thailand; all other countries\n\nEthnic groups\n\nNon-Scandinavian ethnic minorities include:\n\n* Inuit (Greenlandic) from the territory of Greenland\n* Turks\n* Arabs (i.e. Palestinians, followed by Moroccans, Syrians, Lebanese, Yemenis, Egyptians, Iraqis and Jordanians)\n* Vietnamese\n* Thai\n* Jews\n* Chinese\n* Pakistanis\n* Iranians\n* Somalis\n* Ethiopians\n* Sudanese\n* Kurds\n* Indians\n* Chileans (the most numerous of Latin American nationalities)\n* Bosniaks\n* Albanians\n* Bangladeshis\n\nHistoric minorities\n\nEthnic minorities in Denmark include a handful of groups:\n\n* Approximately 15,000 people in Denmark belong to a German minority traditionally referred to as hjemmetyskere meaning \"domestic Germans\" in Danish, and as Nordschleswiger in German. This minority of Germans hold Danish citizenship and self-identify as Germans. Many of them speak German or Low German as their home language. There are also several thousand German citizens and other ethnic Germans residing in Denmark with no historical connection to this group.\n* An estimated 23,000 people  in Denmark proper are ethnic Faroese, while 19,000 Greenlandic people reside permanently in Denmark.  Many of these use the Faroese and Greenlandic languages, respectively, as their first language. All residents of the Danish Realm (viz. Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland) normally hold Danish citizenship, unless they inherit or otherwise receive a foreign citizenship.\n* The religiously affiliated Danish Jews number around 7,000.

Denmark has had religious freedom guaranteed since 1849 by the Constitution, and numerous other religions are officially recognised,[http://www.km.dk/fileadmin/share/Trossamfund/Freedom_of_religion.pdf Freedom of religion and religious communities in Denmark] – The Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs – May 2006.

The Department of Ecclesiastical Affairs recognises roughly a hundred religious congregations for tax and legal purposes such as conducting wedding ceremonies.\n\nIslam is the second largest religion in Denmark.\n\nFor historical reasons, there is a formal distinction between 'approved' (godkendte) and 'recognised' (anerkendte) congregations of faith.
