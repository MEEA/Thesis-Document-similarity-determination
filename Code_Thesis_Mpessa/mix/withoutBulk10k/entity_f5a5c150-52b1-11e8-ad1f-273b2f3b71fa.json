  "textBody" : "In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations , exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots).\n\nThe elementary functions include:\n# Powers of x: x, x^2, x^3,etc\n# Roots of x: \\sqrt{x}, \\sqrt[3]{x},, etc\n# Exponentials: e^x\n# Logarithms: log x\n# Trig Functions\n# Inverse Trig Functions\n# Hyperbolic Trig Functions\n# All functions obtained by substituting x for any of the previous functions\n# All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing any of the previous functions\n\nIt follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is closed under arithmetic operations and composition.
