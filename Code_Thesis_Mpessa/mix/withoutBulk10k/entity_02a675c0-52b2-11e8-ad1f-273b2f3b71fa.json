  "textBody" : "In Norse mythology, Ginnungagap (\"gaping abyss\", \"yawning void\") is  the  primordial void, mentioned in the Gylfaginning, the Eddaic text recording Norse cosmogony.\n\nEtymology\n\nGinnunga- is usually interpreted as deriving from a verb meaning \"gape\" or \"yawn\", but no such word occurs in Old Norse except in verse 3 of the Eddic poem \"Vǫluspá\", \"gap var ginnunga\", which may be a play on the term. In her edition of the poem, Ursula Dronke suggested it was borrowed from Old High German ginunga, as the term Múspell is believed to have been borrowed from Old High German.The Poetic Edda, edited with translation introduction and commentary by Ursula Dronke, Volume II: Mythological Poems, Clarendon Press (1997), pp. 112–14, note to \"Vǫluspá\", line 3/7. Dronke notes that Þjóðólfr of Hvinir also plays on the term in his Haustlǫng, with \"ginnunga vé\". An alternative etymology links the ginn- prefix  with that found in terms with a sacral meaning, such as ginn-heilagr, ginn-regin (both referring to the gods) and ginn-runa (referring to the runes), thus interpreting Ginnungagap as signifying a \"magical (and creative) power-filled space\".De Vries (1977:167); cf. also Dillmann (1998:118-123).\n\nCreation myth\n\nGinnungagap appears as the primordial void in the Norse creation account. The Gylfaginning states:\n\nIn the northern part of Ginnungagap lay the intense cold of Niflheim, and in the southern part lay the equally intense heat of Muspelheim. The cosmogonic process began when the effulgence of the two met in the middle of Ginnungagap.\n\nGeographic rationalization\n\nScandinavian cartographers from the early 15th century attempted to localise or identify Ginnungagap as a real geographic location from which the creation myth derived. A fragment from a 15th-century (pre-Columbus) Old Norse encyclopedic text entitled Gripla (Little Compendium) places Ginnungagap between Greenland and Vinland:\n\nA scholion in a 15th-century manuscript of Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum similarly refers to Ghimmendegop as the Norse word for the abyss in the far north.Dronke, p. 112.\n\nLater the 17th-century Icelandic bishop Guðbrandur Thorlaksson also used the name Ginnungegap to refer to a narrow body of water, possibly the Davis Strait, separating the southern tip of Greenland from Estotelandia, pars America extrema, probably Baffin Island.Seaver, Kirsten \"Maps, Myths and Men\", Stanford University Press (2004) pp. 247-253.",
