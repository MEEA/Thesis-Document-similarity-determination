  "textBody" : "In mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient.  Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers  and is written \\tbinom{n}{k}. It is the coefficient of the  term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power , and it is given by the formula\n\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.\n\nArranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of , and in which  ranges from 0 to , gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle.\n\nThe binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially in the field of combinatorics.\n\\tbinom{n}{k} is often read aloud as \" choose \", because there are \\tbinom{n}{k} ways to choose a subset of size  elements, disregarding their order, from a set of  elements. The properties of binomial coefficients have led to extending the definition to beyond the common case of integers .\n\nHistory and notation\n\nAndreas von Ettingshausen introduced the notation \\tbinom nk in 1826, although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see Pascal's triangle). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by Halayudha, on an ancient Sanskrit text, Pingala's Chandaḥśāstra.  In about 1150, the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book Līlāvatī.Lilavati Section 6, Chapter 4 (see ).\n\nAlternative notations include , , , , , and  in all of which the  stands for combinations or choices. Many calculators use variants of the  because they can represent it on a single-line display.  In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to -permutations of , written as , etc.\n\nDefinition and interpretations \n\nFor natural numbers (taken to include 0) n and k, the binomial coefficient \\tbinom nk can be defined as the coefficient of the monomial Xk in the expansion of . The same coefficient also occurs (if ) in the binomial formula\n\n(valid for any elements x,y of a commutative ring),\nwhich explains the name \"binomial coefficient\".\n\nAnother occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the n factors of the power  one temporarily labels the term X with an index i (running from 1 to n), then each subset of k indices gives after expansion a contribution Xk, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that \\tbinom nk is a natural number for any natural numbers n and k. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of n bits (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is k is given by \\tbinom nk, while the number of ways to write k=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n where every ai is a nonnegative integer is given by \\tbinom{n+k-1}{n-1}. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting k-combinations.\n\nComputing the value of binomial coefficients \n\nSeveral methods exist to compute the value of \\tbinom nk without actually expanding a binomial power or counting k-combinations.\n\nRecursive formula \n\nOne method uses the recursive, purely additive, formula\n\n  \\binom nk = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}k \\quad \\text{for all integers }n,k : 1\\le k\\le n-1,\n\nwith initial/boundary values\n\n\\binom n0 \\binom nn \n 1 \\quad \\text{for all integers } n\\ge0,\n\nThe formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…,n} and counting separately (a) the k-element groupings that include a particular set element, say \"i\", in every group (since \"i\" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose k − 1 from the remaining n − 1) and (b) all the k-groupings that don't include \"i\"; this enumerates all the possible k-combinations of n elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to Xk in . As there is zero Xn+1 or X−1 in , one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include \\tbinom nk = 0 when either k > n or k \\binom nk \\frac{n^{\\underline{k}}}{k!} \n \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots 1}\\prod_{i\n1}^k \\frac{n+1-i}{i},\n\nwhere the numerator of the first fraction n^{\\underline{k}} is expressed as a falling factorial power.\nThis formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.\nThe numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of k distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of n objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same k-combination when order is disregarded.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to k and n−k, calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of k and n−k.\n\nFactorial formula \n\nFinally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar factorial function:\n\n \\binom nk = \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} \\quad \\text{for }\\ 0\\leq k\\leq n,\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n. This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by ; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator.  It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that k is small and n is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)\n\nwhich leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the falling factorial notation,\n\n \\binom nk =  \n\\begin{cases}\n n^{\\underline{k}}/k! & \\text{if }\\ k \\le \\frac{n}{2} \\\\\n n^{\\underline{n-k}}/(n-k)! & \\text{if }\\ k > \\frac{n}{2}\n\\end{cases}.\n\nGeneralization and connection to the binomial series \n\nThe multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extendedSee , which also defines \\tbinom n k = 0 for k. Alternative generalizations, such as to two real or complex valued arguments using the Gamma function assign nonzero values to \\tbinom n k for k, but this causes most binomial coefficient identities to fail, and thus is not widely used majority of definitions.  One such choice of nonzero values leads to the aesthetically pleasing \"Pascal windmill\" in Hilton, Holton and Pedersen, Mathematical reflections: in a room with many mirrors, Springer, 1997, but causes even Pascal's identity to fail (at the origin). by replacing n by an arbitrary number α (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any commutative ring in which all positive integers are invertible:\n\\binom \\alpha k \\frac{\\alpha^{\\underline k}}{k!} \n \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)\\cdots(\\alpha-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots 1}\n  \\quad\\text{for } k\\in\\N \\text{ and arbitrary } \\alpha.\n\nWith this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the \\tbinom\\alpha k binomial coefficients:\n\nThis formula is valid for all complex numbers α and X with |X| (1+X)^\\alpha(1+X)^\\beta(1+X)^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad ((1+X)^\\alpha)^\\beta\n(1+X)^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\nIf α is a nonnegative integer n, then all terms with k > n are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However, for other values of α, including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.\n\nPascal's triangle \n\nPascal's rule is the important recurrence relation\n\nwhich can be used to prove by mathematical induction that  \\tbinom n k is a natural number for all n and k, a fact that is not immediately obvious from formula (1).\n\nPascal's rule also gives rise to Pascal's triangle:\n \n\nRow number n contains the numbers  \\tbinom n k for k = 0,…,n. It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that\n(x + y)5 = 1 x5 + 5 x4y + 10 x3y2 + 10 x2y3 + 5 x y4 + 1 y5.\nThe differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation () above.\n\nCombinatorics and statistics \n\nBinomial coefficients are of importance in combinatorics, because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:\n* There are \\tbinom n k ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.  See Combination.\n* There are \\tbinom {n+k-1}k ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements if repetitions are allowed. See Multiset.\n* There are  \\tbinom {n+k} k strings containing k ones and n zeros.\n* There are  \\tbinom {n+1} k strings consisting of k ones and n zeros such that no two ones are adjacent.\n* The Catalan numbers are \\tfrac{1}{n+1}\\tbinom{2n}{n}.\n* The binomial distribution in statistics is \\tbinom n k p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\!.\n\nBinomial coefficients as polynomials \n\nFor any nonnegative integer k, the expression \\scriptstyle{\\binom{t}{k}} can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by k!:\n\n\\binom{t}{k} \\frac{(t)_k}{k!}\n\\frac{(t)_k}{(k)_k}= \\frac{t(t-1)(t-2)\\cdots(t-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots2 \\cdot 1};\n\nthis presents a polynomial in t with rational coefficients.\n\nAs such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number t to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.\nThese \"generalized binomial coefficients\" appear in Newton's generalized binomial theorem.\n\nFor each k, the polynomial \\tbinom{t}{k} can be characterized as the unique degree k polynomial p(t) satisfying p(0) p(1) \n ... p(k − 1) \n 0 and p(k) = 1.\n\nIts coefficients are expressible in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind:\n\\binom{t}{k} \\sum_{i\n0}^k \\left[{ k \\atop i} \\right]\\frac{t^i}{k!}.\nThe derivative of \\tbinom{t}{k} can be calculated by logarithmic differentiation:\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\binom{t}{k} \\binom{t}{k} \\sum_{i\n0}^{k-1} \\frac{1}{t-i}\\,.\n\nBinomial coefficients as a basis for the space of polynomials \n\nOver any field of characteristic 0 (that is, any field that contains the rational numbers), each polynomial p(t) of degree at most d is uniquely expressible as a linear combination \\sum_{k=0}^d a_k \\binom{t}{k} of binomial coefficients.  The coefficient ak is the kth difference of the sequence p(0), p(1), …, p(k).\nExplicitly,This can be seen as a discrete analog of Taylor's theorem. It is closely related to Newton's polynomial. Alternating sums of this form may be expressed as the Nörlund–Rice integral.\n\nInteger-valued polynomials \n\nEach polynomial \\tbinom{t}{k} is integer-valued: it has an integer value at all integer inputs t.\n(One way to prove this is by induction on k, using Pascal's identity.)\nTherefore, any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.\nConversely, () shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.\nMore generally, for any subring R of a characteristic 0 field K, a polynomial in K[t] takes values in R at all integers if and only if it is an R-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.\n\nExample \n\nThe integer-valued polynomial 3t(3t + 1)/2 can be rewritten as\n9\\tbinom{t}{2} + 6 \\tbinom{t}{1} + 0\\tbinom{t}{0}.\n\nIdentities involving binomial coefficients \n\nThe factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients.  For instance, if k is a positive integer and n is arbitrary, then\n\nand, with a little more work,\n\\binom {n-1}{k} - \\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \\frac{n-2k}{n} \\binom{n}{k}.\nMoreover, the following may be useful:\n\\binom{n}{h}\\binom{n-h}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{n-k}{h}.\nFor constant n, we have the following recurrence:\n \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n+1-k}{k} \\binom{n}{k-1}.\n\nSums of the binomial coefficients \n\nThe formula\n\nis obtained from () by setting x 1 and y \n 1.  This is equivalent to saying that the elements in one row of Pascal's triangle always add up to two raised to an integer power. A combinatorial interpretation of this fact involving double counting is given by counting subsets of size 0, size 1, size 2, and so on up to size n of a set S of n elements. Since we count the number of subsets of size i for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, this sum must be equal to the number of subsets of S, which is known to be 2n.  That is, () is the statement that the power set of a finite set with n elements has size 2n.\nMore explicitly, consider a bit string with n digits. This bit string can be used to represent 2n numbers. Now consider all of the bit strings with no ones in them. There is just one, or rather n choose 0. Next consider the number of bit strings with just a single one in them. There are n, or rather n choose 1. Continuing this way we can see that the equation above holds.\n\nThe formulas\n\nand\n\\sum_{k0}^n k^2 \\binom n k \n (n + n^2)2^{n-2}\nfollow from () after differentiating with respect to x (twice in the latter)  and then substituting x = 1.\n\nThe Chu–Vandermonde identity, which holds for any complex-values m and n and any non-negative integer k, is\n\nand can be found by examination of the coefficient of x^k in the expansion of (1 + x)m (1 + x)n − m (1 + x)n using equation ().  When m \n 1, equation () reduces to equation ().  In the special case n  2m, k \n m, using (), the expansion () becomes (as seen in Pascal's triangle at right)\n\nwhere the term on the right side is a central binomial coefficient.\n\nAnother form of the Chu–Vandermonde identity, which applies for any integers j, k, and n satisfying 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, is\n\nThe proof is similar, but uses the binomial series expansion () with negative integer exponents.\nWhen j = k, equation () gives the hockey-stick identity\n\\sum_{mk}^n \\binom m k \n \\binom {n+1}{k+1}.\n\nLet F(n) denote the n-th Fibonacci number.\nThen\n \\sum_{k0}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} \\binom {n-k} k \n F(n+1).\nThis can be proved by induction using () or by Zeckendorf's representation. A combinatorial proof is given below.\n\nMultisections of sums \n\nFor integers s and t such that 0\\leqslant t , series multisection gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients:\n\\binom{n}{t}+\\binom{n}{t+s}+\\binom{n}{t+2s}+\\ldots\\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{j\n0}^{s-1}\\left(2\\cos\\frac{\\pi j}{s}\\right)^n\\cos\\frac{\\pi(n-2t)j}{s}.\n\nFor small s, these series have particularly nice forms; for example,\n.\n\n \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{3}+\\binom{n}{6}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2^n +2 \\cos\\frac{n\\pi}{3}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{4}+\\binom{n}{7}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2^n +2 \\cos\\frac{(n-2)\\pi}{3}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{2} + \\binom{n}{5}+\\binom{n}{8}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2^n +2 \\cos\\frac{(n-4)\\pi}{3}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{4}+\\binom{n}{8}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2^{n-1} +2^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cos\\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{5}+\\binom{n}{9}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2^{n-1} +2^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\sin\\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{2} + \\binom{n}{6}+\\binom{n}{10}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2^{n-1} -2^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cos\\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right) \n\n \\binom{n}{3} + \\binom{n}{7}+\\binom{n}{11}+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2^{n-1} -2^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\sin\\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right) \n\nPartial sums \n\nAlthough there is no closed formula for partial sums\n\n \\sum_{j=0}^k \\binom n j\n\nof binomial coefficients,. one can again use () and induction to show that for k = 0, ..., n − 1,\n \\sum_{j0}^k (-1)^j\\binom n j \n (-1)^k\\binom {n-1}k,\n\nwith special casesee induction developed in eq (7) p. 1389 in .\n\n\\sum_{j0}^n (-1)^j\\binom n j \n 0\n\nfor n > 0.  This latter result is also a special case of the result from the theory of finite differences that for any polynomial P(x) of degree less than n,\n \\sum_{j0}^n (-1)^j\\binom n j P(j) \n 0.\nDifferentiating () k times and setting x = −1 yields this for\nP(x)=x(x-1)\\cdots(x-k+1),\nwhen 0 ≤ k a_n is the coefficient of degree n in P(x).\n\nMore generally for (),\n \\sum_{j0}^n (-1)^j\\binom n j P(m+(n-j)d) \n d^n n! a_n\nwhere m and d are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying () to the polynomial Q(x):=P(m + dx) instead of P(x), and observing that Q(x) has still degree less than or equal to n, and that its coefficient of degree n is dnan.\n\nThe series\n\\frac{k-1}k\\sum_{j0}^\\infty \\frac 1 {\\binom {j+x} k}\n \\frac 1 {\\binom{x-1}{k-1}} is convergent for k ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the German tank problem. It follows from  \\frac{k-1}k\\sum_{j0}^{M}\\frac 1 {\\binom{j+x} k}\n\\frac 1{\\binom{x-1}{k-1}}-\\frac 1{\\binom{M+x}{k-1}}\nwhich is proved by induction on M.\n\nIdentities with combinatorial proofs \n\nMany identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by combinatorial means. For example, the following identity for nonnegative integers {n} \\geq {q} (which reduces to () when q = 1):\n\n\\sum_{kq}^n \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{q} \n 2^{n-q}\\binom{n}{q}\n\ncan be given a double counting proof, as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of [n] = {1, 2, …, n} with at least q elements, and marking q elements among those selected. The right side counts the same parameter, because there are \\tbinom n q ways of choosing a set of q marks and they occur in all subsets that additionally contain some subset of the remaining elements, of which there are 2^{n-q}.\n\nIn the Pascal's rule\n{n \\choose k} = {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k},\nboth sides count the number of k-element subsets of [n]: the two terms on the right side group them into those that contain element n and those that do not.\n\nThe identity () also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads\n\n\\sum_{k0}^n \\binom{n}{k}^2 \n \\binom{2n}{n}.\n\nSuppose you have 2n empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) n of them. There are \\tbinom {2n}n ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your n squares by selecting k squares from among the first n and n-k squares from the remaining n squares; any k from 0 to n will work. This gives\n\\sum_{k0}^n\\binom  n k\\binom n{n-k} \n \\binom {2n} n.\nNow apply () to get the result.\n\nThe identity \n\\sum_{k0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor} \\tbinom {n-k} k \n F(n+1)\n\nhas the following combinatorial proof. The number \\tbinom{n-k}{k} denotes the number of paths in a two-dimensional lattice from (0,0) to (k,n-k) using steps (0,1) and (1,1). This is easy to see: there are (n-k) steps in total and one may choose the k (1,1) steps. Now, replace each (1,1) step by a (0,2) step; note that there are exactly k. Then one arrives at point (0,n) using steps (0,1) and (0,2). Doing this for all k between 0 and \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor gives all paths from (0,0) to (0,n) using steps (0,1) and (0,2). Clearly, there are exactly F(n+1) such paths.\n\nSum of coefficients row \n\nThe number of k-combinations for all k, \\sum_{0\\leq{k}\\leq{n}}\\binom nk = 2^n, is the sum of the nth row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of base 2 numbers counting from 0 to 2^n - 1, where each digit position is an item from the set of n.\n\nDixon's identity \n\nDixon's identity is\n\n\\sum_{k-a}^{a}(-1)^{k}{2a\\choose k+a}^3 \n\\frac{(3a)!}{(a!)^3}\n\nor, more generally,\n\n\\sum_{k-a}^a(-1)^k{a+b\\choose a+k} {b+c\\choose b+k}{c+a\\choose c+k}  \n \\frac{(a+b+c)!}{a!\\,b!\\,c!}\\,,\n\nwhere a, b, and c are non-negative integers.\n\nContinuous identities \n\nCertain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of\nbinomial coefficients:\n\nFor \\textstyle m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos((2m-n)x)\\cos^n x\\ dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m}\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin((2m-n)x)\\sin^n x\\ dx = \\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(-1)^{m+(n+1)/2} \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m} & n \\text{ odd} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos((2m-n)x)\\sin^n x\\ dx = \\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(-1)^{m+(n/2)} \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m} & n \\text{ even} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\nThese can be proved by using Euler's formula to convert trigonometric functions to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.\n\nGenerating functions \n\nOrdinary generating functions \n\nFor a fixed n, the ordinary generating function of the sequence {n\\choose 0},\\;{n\\choose 1},\\;{n\\choose 2},\\;\\ldots is:\n\\sum_{k0}^\\infty {n\\choose k} x^k \n (1+x)^n.\n\nFor a fixed k,  the ordinary generating function of the sequence {0\\choose k},\\;{1\\choose k},\\;{2\\choose k},\\;\\ldots is:\n\\sum_{nk}^\\infty {n\\choose k} y^n \n \\frac{y^k}{(1-y)^{k+1}}.\n\nThe bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^n {n\\choose k} x^k y^n = \\frac{1}{1-y-xy}.\n\nAnother bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients, which is symmetric, is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {n+k\\choose k} x^k y^n = \\frac{1}{1-x-y}.\n\nExponential generating function \n\nA symmetric exponential bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {n+k\\choose k} \\frac{x^k y^n}{(n+k)!} = e^{x+y}.\n\nDivisibility properties \n\nIn 1852, Kummer proved that if m and n are nonnegative integers and p is a prime number, then the largest power of p dividing \\tbinom{m+n}{m} equals pc, where c is the number of carries when m and n are added in base p.\nEquivalently, the exponent of a prime p in \\tbinom n k\nequals the number of nonnegative integers j such that the fractional part of k/pj is greater than the fractional part of n/pj.  It can be deduced from this that \\tbinom n k is divisible by n/gcd(n,k). In particular therefore it follows that p divides \\tbinom{p^r}{s} for all positive integers r and s such that s r. However this is not true of higher powers of p: for example 9 does not divide \\tbinom{9}{6}.\n\nA somewhat surprising result by David Singmaster (1974) is that any integer divides almost all binomial coefficients.

In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign m+n-k labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects—of weight m and n respectively—that have had their first k labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight m+n-k. (That is, to separate the labels into three portions to apply to the glued part, the unglued part of the first object, and the unglued part of the second object.) In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what falling factorials are to ordinary generating series.\n\nPartial fraction decomposition \n\nThe partial fraction decomposition of the reciprocal is given by\n\\frac{1}\\sum_{i\n0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-i} {n \\choose i} \\frac{n-i}{z-i},  and \\frac{1}\\sum_{i\n1}^n (-1)^{i-1} {n \\choose i} \\frac{i}{z+i}.\n\nNewton's binomial series \n\nNewton's binomial series, named after Sir Isaac Newton, is a generalization of the binomial theorem to infinite series:\n\n (1+z)^{\\alpha} \\sum_{n\n0}^{\\infty}{\\alpha\\choose n}z^n = 1+{\\alpha\\choose1}z+{\\alpha\\choose 2}z^2+\\cdots.\n\nThe identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the differential equation (1 + z) f(z) = α f(z).\n\nThe radius of convergence of this series is 1.

A related combinatorial problem is to count multisets of prescribed size with elements drawn from a given set, that is, to count the number of ways to select a certain number of elements from a given set with the possibility of selecting the same element repeatedly.  The resulting numbers are called multiset coefficients;. the number of ways to \"multichoose\" (i.e., choose with replacement) k items from an n element set is denoted \\left(\\!\\!\\binom n k\\!\\!\\right).\n\nTo avoid ambiguity and confusion with ns main denotation in this article, let f n \n r + (k – 1) and r = f – (k – 1).\n\nMultiset coefficients may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients by the rule\n::::\\binom{f}{k}\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{r}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\n\\binom{r+k-1}{k}.\nOne possible alternative characterization of this identity is as follows:\nWe may define the falling factorial as\n::::(f)_{k}f^{\\underline k}\n(f-k+1)\\cdots(f-3)\\cdot(f-2)\\cdot(f-1)\\cdot f,\nand the corresponding rising factorial as\n::::{\\color{white}{ \\big|}}r^{(k)}\\,r^{\\overline k}\n\\,r\\cdot(r+1)\\cdot(r+2)\\cdot(r+3)\\cdots(r+k-1);\nso, for example,\n::::17\\cdot18\\cdot19\\cdot20\\cdot21(21)_{5}\n21^{\\underline 5}17^{\\overline 5}\n17^{(5)}.\nThen the binomial coefficients may be written as \n::::\\binom{f}{k} \\frac{(f)_{k}}{k!} \n\\frac{(f-k+1)\\cdots(f-2)\\cdot(f-1)\\cdot f}{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdots k}, \nwhile the corresponding multiset coefficient is defined by replacing the falling with the rising factorial:\n::::\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{r}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\\frac{r^{(k)}}{k!}\n\\frac{r\\cdot(r+1)\\cdot(r+2)\\cdots(r+k-1)}{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdots k}.\n\nGeneralization to negative integers \n\nFor any n,\n\n\\begin{align}\\binom{-n}{k} &= \\frac{-n\\cdot-(n+1)\\dots-(n+k-2)\\cdot-(n+k-1)}{k!}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\;\\frac{n\\cdot(n+1)\\cdot(n+2)\\cdots (n + k - 1)}{k!}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{n}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\\;.\\end{align}\nIn particular, binomial coefficients evaluated at negative integers are given by signed multiset coefficients.  In the special case n -1, this reduces to (-1)^k\n\\binom{-1}{k}=\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{-k}{k}\\!\\!\\right) \\,.\n\nFor example, if n -4 and k \n 7, then r 4 and f \n 10:\n\\begin{align}\\binom{-4}{7} &= \\frac\n{-10\\cdot-9\\cdot-8\\cdot-7\\cdot-6\\cdot-5\\cdot-4}\n{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7}\\\\\n&=(-1)^7\\;\\frac{4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}\n{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7}\\\\\n&\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{-7}{7}\\!\\!\\right)\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{4}{7}\\!\\!\\right)\n\\binom{-1}{7}\\binom{10}{7}.\\end{align}\n\nTwo real or complex valued arguments \n\nThe binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the gamma function or beta function via\n{x \\choose y}\\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(x-y+1)}\n \\frac{1}{(x+1) \\Beta(x-y+1,y+1)}.\nThis definition inherits these following additional properties from \\Gamma:\n{x \\choose y}\\frac{\\sin (y \\pi)}{\\sin(x \\pi)} {-y-1 \\choose -x-1}\n \\frac{\\sin((x-y) \\pi)}{\\sin (x \\pi)} {y-x-1 \\choose y};\nmoreover,\n{x \\choose y} \\cdot {y \\choose x}= \\frac{\\sin((x-y) \\pi)}{(x-y) \\pi}.\n\nThe resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in . Notably, many binomial identities fail: \\textstyle but \\textstyle for n positive (so -n negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the x and y axes and the line y=x), with the behavior for negative x having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:\n* in the octant 0 \\leq y \\leq x it is a smoothly interpolated form of the usual binomial, with a ridge (\"Pascal's ridge\").\n* in the octant 0 \\leq x \\leq y and in the quadrant x \\geq 0, y \\leq 0 the function is close to zero.\n* in the quadrant x \\leq 0, y \\geq 0 the function is alternatingly very large positive and negative on the parallelograms with vertices (-n,m+1), (-n,m), (-n-1,m-1), (-n-1,m)\n* in the octant 0 > x > y the behavior is again alternatingly very large positive and negative, but on a square grid.\n* in the octant -1 > y > x + 1 it is close to zero, except for near the singularities.\n\nGeneralization to q-series \n\nThe binomial coefficient has a q-analog generalization known as the Gaussian binomial coefficient.\n\nGeneralization to infinite cardinals \n\nThe definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to infinite cardinals by defining:\n\n{\\alpha \\choose \\beta} | \\{ B \\subseteq A : |B| \n \\beta \\} |\n\nwhere A is some set with cardinality \\alpha. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number \\alpha, {\\alpha \\choose \\beta} will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.\n\nAssuming the Axiom of Choice, one can show that {\\alpha \\choose \\alpha} = 2^{\\alpha} for any infinite cardinal \\alpha.\n\nBinomial coefficient in programming languages\n\nThe notation  {n \\choose k}  is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for typewriters and computer terminals. Many programming languages do not offer a standard subroutine for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the APL programming language and the (related) J programming language use the exclamation mark:  k ! n .\n\nNaive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in Python:\n\nfrom math import factorial\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n\nare very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as C or Java they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:\n\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k  n:\n        return 0\n    if k 0 or k \n n:\n        return 1\n    k = min(k, n - k) # take advantage of symmetry\n    c = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1)\n    return c\n\n(In Python, range(k) produces a list from 0 to k–1.)\n\nPascal's rule provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python, although it is less efficient:\n\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k  n:\n        return 0\n    if k > n - k: # take advantage of symmetry\n        k = n - k\n    if k 0 or n \n\nThe example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following Scheme example uses the recursive definition\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\frac{n-k}{k+1} {n \\choose k} \nRational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1) \nThe following implementation uses all these ideas\n\n(define (binomial n k)\n;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion\n  (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)\n    (if (>= i k)\n      prev\n     (binomial-iter n k (+ i 1) (/ (* (- n i) prev) (+ i 1)))))\n;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k)\n  (if (\n\nWhen computing \\textstyle {n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1)  in a language with fixed-length integers, the multiplication by (n-k) may overflow even when the result would fit. The overflow can be avoided by dividing first and fixing the result using the remainder:\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[\\textstyle {n \\choose k} \\div (k+1)\\right](n-k) + {\\left[{n\\choose k}\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ (k+1)\\right](n-k) \\over (k+1)}\n\nImplementation in the C language:\n\n#include \nunsigned binomial(unsigned n, unsigned k) {\n  unsigned c = 1, i;\n  if (k > n-k) k = n-k;  /* take advantage of symmetry */\n  for (i 1; i  UINT_MAX/n) return 0;  /* return 0 on overflow */\n    c = c/i * n + c%i * n / i;  /* split c*n/i into (c/i*i + c%i)*n/i */\n  }\n  return c;\n}\n\nAnother way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that\n\n  {n \\choose k} \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} \n \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Gamma(k+1)\\,\\Gamma(n-k+1)} = \\exp(\\ln\\Gamma(n+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(k+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(n-k+1)),\n\nwhere \\ln \\Gamma(n) denotes the natural logarithm of the gamma function at n.

    "aggregatedText" : "In mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient.  Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers  and is written \\tbinom{n}{k}. It is the coefficient of the  term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power , and it is given by the formula\n\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.\n\nArranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of , and in which  ranges from 0 to , gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle.\n\nThe binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially in the field of combinatorics.\n\\tbinom{n}{k} is often read aloud as \" choose \", because there are \\tbinom{n}{k} ways to choose a subset of size  elements, disregarding their order, from a set of  elements. The properties of binomial coefficients have led to extending the definition to beyond the common case of integers .\n\nHistory and notation\n\nAndreas von Ettingshausen introduced the notation \\tbinom nk in 1826, although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see Pascal's triangle). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by Halayudha, on an ancient Sanskrit text, Pingala's Chandaḥśāstra.  In about 1150, the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book Līlāvatī.Lilavati Section 6, Chapter 4 (see ).\n\nAlternative notations include , , , , , and  in all of which the  stands for combinations or choices. Many calculators use variants of the  because they can represent it on a single-line display.  In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to -permutations of , written as , etc.\n\nDefinition and interpretations \n\nFor natural numbers (taken to include 0) n and k, the binomial coefficient \\tbinom nk can be defined as the coefficient of the monomial Xk in the expansion of . The same coefficient also occurs (if ) in the binomial formula\n\n(valid for any elements x,y of a commutative ring),\nwhich explains the name \"binomial coefficient\".\n\nAnother occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the n factors of the power  one temporarily labels the term X with an index i (running from 1 to n), then each subset of k indices gives after expansion a contribution Xk, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that \\tbinom nk is a natural number for any natural numbers n and k. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of n bits (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is k is given by \\tbinom nk, while the number of ways to write k=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n where every ai is a nonnegative integer is given by \\tbinom{n+k-1}{n-1}. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting k-combinations.\n\nComputing the value of binomial coefficients \n\nSeveral methods exist to compute the value of \\tbinom nk without actually expanding a binomial power or counting k-combinations.\n\nRecursive formula \n\nOne method uses the recursive, purely additive, formula\n\n  \\binom nk = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}k \\quad \\text{for all integers }n,k : 1\\le k\\le n-1,\n\nwith initial/boundary values\n\n\\binom n0 \\binom nn \n 1 \\quad \\text{for all integers } n\\ge0,\n\nThe formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…,n} and counting separately (a) the k-element groupings that include a particular set element, say \"i\", in every group (since \"i\" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose k − 1 from the remaining n − 1) and (b) all the k-groupings that don't include \"i\"; this enumerates all the possible k-combinations of n elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to Xk in . As there is zero Xn+1 or X−1 in , one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include \\tbinom nk = 0 when either k > n or k \\binom nk \\frac{n^{\\underline{k}}}{k!} \n \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots 1}\\prod_{i\n1}^k \\frac{n+1-i}{i},\n\nwhere the numerator of the first fraction n^{\\underline{k}} is expressed as a falling factorial power.\nThis formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.\nThe numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of k distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of n objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same k-combination when order is disregarded.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to k and n−k, calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of k and n−k.\n\nFactorial formula \n\nFinally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar factorial function:\n\n \\binom nk = \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} \\quad \\text{for }\\ 0\\leq k\\leq n,\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n. This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by ; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator.  It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that k is small and n is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)\n\nwhich leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the falling factorial notation,\n\n \\binom nk =  \n\\begin{cases}\n n^{\\underline{k}}/k! & \\text{if }\\ k \\le \\frac{n}{2} \\\\\n n^{\\underline{n-k}}/(n-k)! & \\text{if }\\ k > \\frac{n}{2}\n\\end{cases}.\n\nGeneralization and connection to the binomial series \n\nThe multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extendedSee , which also defines \\tbinom n k = 0 for k. Alternative generalizations, such as to two real or complex valued arguments using the Gamma function assign nonzero values to \\tbinom n k for k, but this causes most binomial coefficient identities to fail, and thus is not widely used majority of definitions.  One such choice of nonzero values leads to the aesthetically pleasing \"Pascal windmill\" in Hilton, Holton and Pedersen, Mathematical reflections: in a room with many mirrors, Springer, 1997, but causes even Pascal's identity to fail (at the origin). by replacing n by an arbitrary number α (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any commutative ring in which all positive integers are invertible:\n\\binom \\alpha k \\frac{\\alpha^{\\underline k}}{k!} \n \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)\\cdots(\\alpha-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots 1}\n  \\quad\\text{for } k\\in\\N \\text{ and arbitrary } \\alpha.\n\nWith this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the \\tbinom\\alpha k binomial coefficients:\n\nThis formula is valid for all complex numbers α and X with |X| (1+X)^\\alpha(1+X)^\\beta(1+X)^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad ((1+X)^\\alpha)^\\beta\n(1+X)^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\nIf α is a nonnegative integer n, then all terms with k > n are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However, for other values of α, including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.\n\nPascal's triangle \n\nPascal's rule is the important recurrence relation\n\nwhich can be used to prove by mathematical induction that  \\tbinom n k is a natural number for all n and k, a fact that is not immediately obvious from formula (1).\n\nPascal's rule also gives rise to Pascal's triangle:\n \n\nRow number n contains the numbers  \\tbinom n k for k = 0,…,n. It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that\n(x + y)5 = 1 x5 + 5 x4y + 10 x3y2 + 10 x2y3 + 5 x y4 + 1 y5.\nThe differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation () above.\n\nCombinatorics and statistics \n\nBinomial coefficients are of importance in combinatorics, because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:\n* There are \\tbinom n k ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.  See Combination.\n* There are \\tbinom {n+k-1}k ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements if repetitions are allowed. See Multiset.\n* There are  \\tbinom {n+k} k strings containing k ones and n zeros.\n* There are  \\tbinom {n+1} k strings consisting of k ones and n zeros such that no two ones are adjacent.\n* The Catalan numbers are \\tfrac{1}{n+1}\\tbinom{2n}{n}.\n* The binomial distribution in statistics is \\tbinom n k p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\!.\n\nBinomial coefficients as polynomials \n\nFor any nonnegative integer k, the expression \\scriptstyle{\\binom{t}{k}} can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by k!:\n\n\\binom{t}{k} \\frac{(t)_k}{k!}\n\\frac{(t)_k}{(k)_k}= \\frac{t(t-1)(t-2)\\cdots(t-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots2 \\cdot 1};\n\nthis presents a polynomial in t with rational coefficients.\n\nAs such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number t to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.\nThese \"generalized binomial coefficients\" appear in Newton's generalized binomial theorem.\n\nFor each k, the polynomial \\tbinom{t}{k} can be characterized as the unique degree k polynomial p(t) satisfying p(0) p(1) \n ... p(k − 1) \n 0 and p(k) = 1.\n\nIts coefficients are expressible in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind:\n\\binom{t}{k} \\sum_{i\n0}^k \\left[{ k \\atop i} \\right]\\frac{t^i}{k!}.\nThe derivative of \\tbinom{t}{k} can be calculated by logarithmic differentiation:\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\binom{t}{k} \\binom{t}{k} \\sum_{i\n0}^{k-1} \\frac{1}{t-i}\\,.\n\nBinomial coefficients as a basis for the space of polynomials \n\nOver any field of characteristic 0 (that is, any field that contains the rational numbers), each polynomial p(t) of degree at most d is uniquely expressible as a linear combination \\sum_{k=0}^d a_k \\binom{t}{k} of binomial coefficients.  The coefficient ak is the kth difference of the sequence p(0), p(1), …, p(k).\nExplicitly,This can be seen as a discrete analog of Taylor's theorem. It is closely related to Newton's polynomial. Alternating sums of this form may be expressed as the Nörlund–Rice integral.\n\nInteger-valued polynomials \n\nEach polynomial \\tbinom{t}{k} is integer-valued: it has an integer value at all integer inputs t.\n(One way to prove this is by induction on k, using Pascal's identity.)\nTherefore, any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.\nConversely, () shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.\nMore generally, for any subring R of a characteristic 0 field K, a polynomial in K[t] takes values in R at all integers if and only if it is an R-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.\n\nExample \n\nThe integer-valued polynomial 3t(3t + 1)/2 can be rewritten as\n9\\tbinom{t}{2} + 6 \\tbinom{t}{1} + 0\\tbinom{t}{0}.\n\nIdentities involving binomial coefficients \n\nThe factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients.  For instance, if k is a positive integer and n is arbitrary, then\n\nand, with a little more work,\n\\binom {n-1}{k} - \\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \\frac{n-2k}{n} \\binom{n}{k}.\nMoreover, the following may be useful:\n\\binom{n}{h}\\binom{n-h}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{n-k}{h}.\nFor constant n, we have the following recurrence:\n \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n+1-k}{k} \\binom{n}{k-1}.\n\nSums of the binomial coefficients \n\nThe formula\n\nis obtained from () by setting x 1 and y \n 1.  This is equivalent to saying that the elements in one row of Pascal's triangle always add up to two raised to an integer power. A combinatorial interpretation of this fact involving double counting is given by counting subsets of size 0, size 1, size 2, and so on up to size n of a set S of n elements. Since we count the number of subsets of size i for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, this sum must be equal to the number of subsets of S, which is known to be 2n.  That is, () is the statement that the power set of a finite set with n elements has size 2n.\nMore explicitly, consider a bit string with n digits. This bit string can be used to represent 2n numbers. Now consider all of the bit strings with no ones in them. There is just one, or rather n choose 0. Next consider the number of bit strings with just a single one in them. There are n, or rather n choose 1. Continuing this way we can see that the equation above holds.\n\nThe formulas\n\nand\n\\sum_{k0}^n k^2 \\binom n k \n (n + n^2)2^{n-2}\nfollow from () after differentiating with respect to x (twice in the latter)  and then substituting x = 1.\n\nThe Chu–Vandermonde identity, which holds for any complex-values m and n and any non-negative integer k, is\n\nand can be found by examination of the coefficient of x^k in the expansion of (1 + x)m (1 + x)n − m (1 + x)n using equation ().  When m \n 1, equation () reduces to equation ().  In the special case n  2m, k \n m, using (), the expansion () becomes (as seen in Pascal's triangle at right)\n\nwhere the term on the right side is a central binomial coefficient.\n\nAnother form of the Chu–Vandermonde identity, which applies for any integers j, k, and n satisfying 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, is\n\nThe proof is similar, but uses the binomial series expansion () with negative integer exponents.\nWhen j = k, equation () gives the hockey-stick identity\n\\sum_{mk}^n \\binom m k \n \\binom {n+1}{k+1}.\n\nLet F(n) denote the n-th Fibonacci number.\nThen\n \\sum_{k0}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} \\binom {n-k} k \n F(n+1).\nThis can be proved by induction using () or by Zeckendorf's representation.

This latter result is also a special case of the result from the theory of finite differences that for any polynomial P(x) of degree less than n,\n \\sum_{j0}^n (-1)^j\\binom n j P(j) \n 0.\nDifferentiating () k times and setting x = −1 yields this for\nP(x)=x(x-1)\\cdots(x-k+1),\nwhen 0 ≤ k a_n is the coefficient of degree n in P(x).\n\nMore generally for (),\n \\sum_{j0}^n (-1)^j\\binom n j P(m+(n-j)d) \n d^n n! a_n\nwhere m and d are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying () to the polynomial Q(x):=P(m + dx) instead of P(x), and observing that Q(x) has still degree less than or equal to n, and that its coefficient of degree n is dnan.\n\nThe series\n\\frac{k-1}k\\sum_{j0}^\\infty \\frac 1 {\\binom {j+x} k}\n \\frac 1 {\\binom{x-1}{k-1}} is convergent for k ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the German tank problem.

For example, the following identity for nonnegative integers {n} \\geq {q} (which reduces to () when q = 1):\n\n\\sum_{kq}^n \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{q} \n 2^{n-q}\\binom{n}{q}\n\ncan be given a double counting proof, as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of [n] = {1, 2, …, n} with at least q elements, and marking q elements among those selected. The right side counts the same parameter, because there are \\tbinom n q ways of choosing a set of q marks and they occur in all subsets that additionally contain some subset of the remaining elements, of which there are 2^{n-q}.\n\nIn the Pascal's rule\n{n \\choose k} = {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k},\nboth sides count the number of k-element subsets of [n]: the two terms on the right side group them into those that contain element n and those that do not.\n\nThe identity () also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads\n\n\\sum_{k0}^n \\binom{n}{k}^2 \n \\binom{2n}{n}.\n\nSuppose you have 2n empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) n of them. There are \\tbinom {2n}n ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your n squares by selecting k squares from among the first n and n-k squares from the remaining n squares; any k from 0 to n will work. This gives\n\\sum_{k0}^n\\binom  n k\\binom n{n-k} \n \\binom {2n} n.\nNow apply () to get the result.\n\nThe identity \n\\sum_{k0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor} \\tbinom {n-k} k \n F(n+1)\n\nhas the following combinatorial proof. The number \\tbinom{n-k}{k} denotes the number of paths in a two-dimensional lattice from (0,0) to (k,n-k) using steps (0,1) and (1,1). This is easy to see: there are (n-k) steps in total and one may choose the k (1,1) steps. Now, replace each (1,1) step by a (0,2) step; note that there are exactly k. Then one arrives at point (0,n) using steps (0,1) and (0,2). Doing this for all k between 0 and \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor gives all paths from (0,0) to (0,n) using steps (0,1) and (0,2). Clearly, there are exactly F(n+1) such paths.\n\nSum of coefficients row \n\nThe number of k-combinations for all k, \\sum_{0\\leq{k}\\leq{n}}\\binom nk = 2^n, is the sum of the nth row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of base 2 numbers counting from 0 to 2^n - 1, where each digit position is an item from the set of n.\n\nDixon's identity \n\nDixon's identity is\n\n\\sum_{k-a}^{a}(-1)^{k}{2a\\choose k+a}^3 \n\\frac{(3a)!}{(a!)^3}\n\nor, more generally,\n\n\\sum_{k-a}^a(-1)^k{a+b\\choose a+k} {b+c\\choose b+k}{c+a\\choose c+k}  \n \\frac{(a+b+c)!}{a!\\,b!\\,c!}\\,,\n\nwhere a, b, and c are non-negative integers.\n\nContinuous identities \n\nCertain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of\nbinomial coefficients:\n\nFor \\textstyle m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos((2m-n)x)\\cos^n x\\ dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m}\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin((2m-n)x)\\sin^n x\\ dx = \\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(-1)^{m+(n+1)/2} \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m} & n \\text{ odd} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\n\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos((2m-n)x)\\sin^n x\\ dx = \\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(-1)^{m+(n/2)} \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n-1}} \\binom{n}{m} & n \\text{ even} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\nThese can be proved by using Euler's formula to convert trigonometric functions to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.\n\nGenerating functions \n\nOrdinary generating functions \n\nFor a fixed n, the ordinary generating function of the sequence {n\\choose 0},\\;{n\\choose 1},\\;{n\\choose 2},\\;\\ldots is:\n\\sum_{k0}^\\infty {n\\choose k} x^k \n (1+x)^n.\n\nFor a fixed k,  the ordinary generating function of the sequence {0\\choose k},\\;{1\\choose k},\\;{2\\choose k},\\;\\ldots is:\n\\sum_{nk}^\\infty {n\\choose k} y^n \n \\frac{y^k}{(1-y)^{k+1}}.\n\nThe bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^n {n\\choose k} x^k y^n = \\frac{1}{1-y-xy}.\n\nAnother bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients, which is symmetric, is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {n+k\\choose k} x^k y^n = \\frac{1}{1-x-y}.\n\nExponential generating function \n\nA symmetric exponential bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {n+k\\choose k} \\frac{x^k y^n}{(n+k)!} = e^{x+y}.\n\nDivisibility properties \n\nIn 1852, Kummer proved that if m and n are nonnegative integers and p is a prime number, then the largest power of p dividing \\tbinom{m+n}{m} equals pc, where c is the number of carries when m and n are added in base p.\nEquivalently, the exponent of a prime p in \\tbinom n k\nequals the number of nonnegative integers j such that the fractional part of k/pj is greater than the fractional part of n/pj.  It can be deduced from this that \\tbinom n k is divisible by n/gcd(n,k). In particular therefore it follows that p divides \\tbinom{p^r}{s} for all positive integers r and s such that s r. However this is not true of higher powers of p: for example 9 does not divide \\tbinom{9}{6}.\n\nA somewhat surprising result by David Singmaster (1974) is that any integer divides almost all binomial coefficients.

In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what falling factorials are to ordinary generating series.\n\nPartial fraction decomposition \n\nThe partial fraction decomposition of the reciprocal is given by\n\\frac{1}\\sum_{i\n0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-i} {n \\choose i} \\frac{n-i}{z-i},  and \\frac{1}\\sum_{i\n1}^n (-1)^{i-1} {n \\choose i} \\frac{i}{z+i}.\n\nNewton's binomial series \n\nNewton's binomial series, named after Sir Isaac Newton, is a generalization of the binomial theorem to infinite series:\n\n (1+z)^{\\alpha} \\sum_{n\n0}^{\\infty}{\\alpha\\choose n}z^n = 1+{\\alpha\\choose1}z+{\\alpha\\choose 2}z^2+\\cdots.\n\nThe identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the differential equation (1 + z) f(z) = α f(z).\n\nThe radius of convergence of this series is 1.  An alternative expression is\n\n\\frac{1}{(1-z)^{\\alpha+1}} \\sum_{n\n0}^{\\infty}{n+\\alpha \\choose n}z^n\n\nwhere the identity\n\n{n \\choose k} = (-1)^k {k-n-1 \\choose k}\n\nis applied.\n\nMultiset (rising) binomial coefficient \n\nBinomial coefficients count subsets of prescribed size from a given set.  A related combinatorial problem is to count multisets of prescribed size with elements drawn from a given set, that is, to count the number of ways to select a certain number of elements from a given set with the possibility of selecting the same element repeatedly.  The resulting numbers are called multiset coefficients;. the number of ways to \"multichoose\" (i.e., choose with replacement) k items from an n element set is denoted \\left(\\!\\!\\binom n k\\!\\!\\right).\n\nTo avoid ambiguity and confusion with ns main denotation in this article, let f n \n r + (k – 1) and r = f – (k – 1).\n\nMultiset coefficients may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients by the rule\n::::\\binom{f}{k}\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{r}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\n\\binom{r+k-1}{k}.\nOne possible alternative characterization of this identity is as follows:\nWe may define the falling factorial as\n::::(f)_{k}f^{\\underline k}\n(f-k+1)\\cdots(f-3)\\cdot(f-2)\\cdot(f-1)\\cdot f,\nand the corresponding rising factorial as\n::::{\\color{white}{ \\big|}}r^{(k)}\\,r^{\\overline k}\n\\,r\\cdot(r+1)\\cdot(r+2)\\cdot(r+3)\\cdots(r+k-1);\nso, for example,\n::::17\\cdot18\\cdot19\\cdot20\\cdot21(21)_{5}\n21^{\\underline 5}17^{\\overline 5}\n17^{(5)}.\nThen the binomial coefficients may be written as \n::::\\binom{f}{k} \\frac{(f)_{k}}{k!} \n\\frac{(f-k+1)\\cdots(f-2)\\cdot(f-1)\\cdot f}{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdots k}, \nwhile the corresponding multiset coefficient is defined by replacing the falling with the rising factorial:\n::::\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{r}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\\frac{r^{(k)}}{k!}\n\\frac{r\\cdot(r+1)\\cdot(r+2)\\cdots(r+k-1)}{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdots k}.\n\nGeneralization to negative integers \n\nFor any n,\n\n\\begin{align}\\binom{-n}{k} &= \\frac{-n\\cdot-(n+1)\\dots-(n+k-2)\\cdot-(n+k-1)}{k!}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\;\\frac{n\\cdot(n+1)\\cdot(n+2)\\cdots (n + k - 1)}{k!}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\\\\n&=(-1)^k\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{n}{k}\\!\\!\\right)\\;.\\end{align}\nIn particular, binomial coefficients evaluated at negative integers are given by signed multiset coefficients.  In the special case n -1, this reduces to (-1)^k\n\\binom{-1}{k}=\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{-k}{k}\\!\\!\\right) \\,.\n\nFor example, if n -4 and k \n 7, then r 4 and f \n 10:\n\\begin{align}\\binom{-4}{7} &= \\frac\n{-10\\cdot-9\\cdot-8\\cdot-7\\cdot-6\\cdot-5\\cdot-4}\n{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7}\\\\\n&=(-1)^7\\;\\frac{4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}\n{1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7}\\\\\n&\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{-7}{7}\\!\\!\\right)\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{4}{7}\\!\\!\\right)\n\\binom{-1}{7}\\binom{10}{7}.\\end{align}\n\nTwo real or complex valued arguments \n\nThe binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the gamma function or beta function via\n{x \\choose y}\\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(x-y+1)}\n \\frac{1}{(x+1) \\Beta(x-y+1,y+1)}.\nThis definition inherits these following additional properties from \\Gamma:\n{x \\choose y}\\frac{\\sin (y \\pi)}{\\sin(x \\pi)} {-y-1 \\choose -x-1}\n \\frac{\\sin((x-y) \\pi)}{\\sin (x \\pi)} {y-x-1 \\choose y};\nmoreover,\n{x \\choose y} \\cdot {y \\choose x}= \\frac{\\sin((x-y) \\pi)}{(x-y) \\pi}.\n\nThe resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in . Notably, many binomial identities fail: \\textstyle but \\textstyle for n positive (so -n negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the x and y axes and the line y=x), with the behavior for negative x having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:\n* in the octant 0 \\leq y \\leq x it is a smoothly interpolated form of the usual binomial, with a ridge (\"Pascal's ridge\").\n* in the octant 0 \\leq x \\leq y and in the quadrant x \\geq 0, y \\leq 0 the function is close to zero.\n* in the quadrant x \\leq 0, y \\geq 0 the function is alternatingly very large positive and negative on the parallelograms with vertices (-n,m+1), (-n,m), (-n-1,m-1), (-n-1,m)\n* in the octant 0 > x > y the behavior is again alternatingly very large positive and negative, but on a square grid.\n* in the octant -1 > y > x + 1 it is close to zero, except for near the singularities.\n\nGeneralization to q-series \n\nThe binomial coefficient has a q-analog generalization known as the Gaussian binomial coefficient.\n\nGeneralization to infinite cardinals \n\nThe definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to infinite cardinals by defining:\n\n{\\alpha \\choose \\beta} | \\{ B \\subseteq A : |B| \n \\beta \\} |\n\nwhere A is some set with cardinality \\alpha. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number \\alpha, {\\alpha \\choose \\beta} will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.\n\nAssuming the Axiom of Choice, one can show that {\\alpha \\choose \\alpha} = 2^{\\alpha} for any infinite cardinal \\alpha.\n\nBinomial coefficient in programming languages\n\nThe notation  {n \\choose k}  is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for typewriters and computer terminals. Many programming languages do not offer a standard subroutine for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the APL programming language and the (related) J programming language use the exclamation mark:  k ! n .\n\nNaive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in Python:\n\nfrom math import factorial\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n\nare very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as C or Java they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:\n\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k  n:\n        return 0\n    if k 0 or k \n n:\n        return 1\n    k = min(k, n - k) # take advantage of symmetry\n    c = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1)\n    return c\n\n(In Python, range(k) produces a list from 0 to k–1.)\n\nPascal's rule provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python, although it is less efficient:\n\ndef binomialCoefficient(n, k):\n    if k  n:\n        return 0\n    if k > n - k: # take advantage of symmetry\n        k = n - k\n    if k 0 or n \n\nThe example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following Scheme example uses the recursive definition\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\frac{n-k}{k+1} {n \\choose k} \nRational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1) \nThe following implementation uses all these ideas\n\n(define (binomial n k)\n;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion\n  (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)\n    (if (>= i k)\n      prev\n     (binomial-iter n k (+ i 1) (/ (* (- n i) prev) (+ i 1)))))\n;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k)\n  (if (\n\nWhen computing \\textstyle {n \\choose k+1} = \\left[(n-k) {n \\choose k}\\right] \\div (k+1)  in a language with fixed-length integers, the multiplication by (n-k) may overflow even when the result would fit. The overflow can be avoided by dividing first and fixing the result using the remainder:\n{n \\choose k+1} = \\left[\\textstyle {n \\choose k} \\div (k+1)\\right](n-k) + {\\left[{n\\choose k}\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ (k+1)\\right](n-k) \\over (k+1)}\n\nImplementation in the C language:\n\n#include \nunsigned binomial(unsigned n, unsigned k) {\n  unsigned c = 1, i;\n  if (k > n-k) k = n-k;  /* take advantage of symmetry */\n  for (i 1; i  UINT_MAX/n) return 0;  /* return 0 on overflow */\n    c = c/i * n + c%i * n / i;  /* split c*n/i into (c/i*i + c%i)*n/i */\n  }\n  return c;\n}\n\nAnother way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that\n\n  {n \\choose k} \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!} \n \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Gamma(k+1)\\,\\Gamma(n-k+1)} = \\exp(\\ln\\Gamma(n+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(k+1)-\\ln\\Gamma(n-k+1)),\n\nwhere \\ln \\Gamma(n) denotes the natural logarithm of the gamma function at n. It is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using log_gamma in Maxima, LogGamma in Mathematica, gammaln in MATLAB and Python's SciPy module, lngamma in PARI/GP or lgamma in R and Julia.
