  "textBody" : "The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) is a desktop environment for Unix and OpenVMS, based on the Motif widget toolkit. It was part of the UNIX 98 Workstation Product Standard, and was long the \"classic\" Unix desktop associated with commercial Unix workstations.\n\nAfter a long history as proprietary software, CDE was released as free software on 6 August 2012, under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2 or later.\n Since its release as free software, CDE has been ported to Linux and BSD derivatives.\n\nEarly development \n\nHewlett-Packard, IBM, SunSoft, and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. Each development group contributed its own technology to CDE:\n\n* HP contributed the primary environment for CDE, which was based on HP's Visual User Environment (VUE). HP VUE was itself derived from the Motif Window Manager.\n* IBM contributed its Common User Access model from OS/2's Workplace Shell.\n* Sun contributed its ToolTalk application interaction framework and a port of its DeskSet productivity tools, including mail and calendar clients, from its OpenWindows environment.\n* USL provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from UNIX System V.\n\nAfter its release, HP endorsed CDE as the new standard desktop for Unix, and provided documentation and software for migrating HP VUE customizations to CDE.\n\nIn March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the \"new OSF\", a merger of the Open Software Foundation and Unix International;\n\nin September 1995, the merger of Motif and CDE into a single project, CDE/Motif, was announced. OSF became part of the newly formed Open Group in 1996.\n\nIn February 1997, the Open Group released their last major version of CDE, version 2.1.TOG Press Release: [http://www.opengroup.org/desktop/Press_Releases/cde2.1ga.htm The Open Group Announces Common Desktop Environment 2.1]\n\nRed Hat Linux was the only Linux distribution to which proprietary CDE was ported. In 1997, Red Hat began offering a version of CDE licensed from TriTeal Corporation. In 1998, Xi Graphics, a company specializing in the X Windowing System, offered a version of CDE bundled with Red Hat Linux, called Xi Graphics maXimum cde/OS. These were phased out, and Red Hat moved to the GNOME desktop.\n\nUntil about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the de facto standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as GNOME and K Desktop Environment 2 were quickly becoming mature, and became widespread on Linux systems.\n\nIn 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard Solaris desktop environment in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based Java Desktop System. The Solaris 11 release in November 2011 only contains GNOME as a full desktop, though some CDE libraries, such as Motif and Tooltalk, remain for binary compatibility. The OpenSolaris open source project did not include CDE, and had no intent to make Solaris CDE available as open source.\n\nSystems using early CDE \n\n* IBM AIX\n* Digital UNIX\n* HP-UX: from version 10.10, released in 1996.[http://www.unixguide.net/hp/faq/3.3.shtml HP-UX : FAQ]\n* IRIX: for a short time CDE was an alternative to IID.[http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?coll0650&db\nrelnotes&fname=/usr/relnotes/cde IRIX 6.5 Release Notes for CDE]\n* OpenVMS\n* Solaris: available starting with 2.3, standard in 2.6 to 10.\n* Tru64 UNIX\n* UnixWare\n* UXP/DS\n* Red Hat Linux: Two versions ported by Triteal and Xi Graphics\n\nProprietary licensing \n\nFrom its launch until 2012, CDE was proprietary software.\n\nMotif, the toolkit on which CDE is built, was released by The Open Group in 2000 as \"Open Motif,\" under a \"revenue sharing\" license. That license did not meet either the open source or free software definitions. The Open Group had wished to make Motif open source, but did not succeed doing so at that time.\n\nRelease under the GNU LGPL \n\nIn 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license. On August 6, 2012, CDE was open-sourced under the LGPL free software license.\n The CDE source code was then released to SourceForge.\n\nThe free software project OpenCDE had been started in 2010 to reproduce the look and feel, organization, and feature set of CDE.\n  In August 2012, when CDE was released as free software, OpenCDE was officially deprecated in favor of CDE.\n\nOn October 23, 2012, the Motif widget toolkit was also released under the LGPL v2.1. This allowed CDE to become a completely free and open source desktop environment.\n\nShortly after CDE was released as free software, a Linux live CD was created based on Debian 6 with CDE 2.2.0c pre-installed, called CDEbian. The live CD has since been discontinued.\n\nCDE project developments\n\nIn March 2014, the first stable release of CDE, version 2.2.1, was made since its release as free software.\n\nBeginning with version 2.2.2, released in July 2014, CDE is able to compile under FreeBSD 10 with the default Clang compiler.\n\nSince its release as free software, CDE has been ported to:\n\n* Linux distributions including:\n** Debian GNU/Linux\n** Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n** Slackware Linux\n** Ubuntu\n* FreeBSD\n* NetBSD\n* OpenBSD\n* OpenIndiana\n* Solaris 11 (x86-64)\n\nFuture project goals of the CDE project include:\n\n* Increased portability to more Linux, BSD, and Unix platforms.\n* Further internationalization into other languages.",
