It is clear that \\{\\deg(f_0), \\deg(f_1), \\ldots \\} is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let a_n be the leading coefficient of f_n and let \\mathfrak{b} be the left ideal in R generated by a_0,a_1,\\ldots. Since R is Noetherian the chain of ideals \n\n(a_0)\\subset(a_0,a_1)\\subset(a_0,a_1,a_2) \\subset \\cdots \n\nmust terminate. Thus \\mathfrak b = (a_0,\\ldots ,a_{N-1}) for some integer N.
