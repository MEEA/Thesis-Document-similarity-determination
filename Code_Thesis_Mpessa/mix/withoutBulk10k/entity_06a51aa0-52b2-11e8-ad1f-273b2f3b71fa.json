  "textBody" : "Galactus is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a cosmic entity who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the primary Marvel continuity. Galactus was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in the comic book Fantastic Four #48, published in March 1966.\n\nLee and Kirby had desired to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain, culminating in the creation of Galactus. In the character's first appearance Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgments of mortal beings. Galactus' initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer Mark Gruenwald further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe that existed prior to the Big Bang which began the current universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the \"Sentience of the Universe\" to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by John Byrne, Jim Starlin, and Louise Simonson explored Galactus' role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the Silver Surfer), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.\n\nThe character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as arcade games, video games, animated television series, and the 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.\n\nIn 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on IGN's list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains\", citing the character's \"larger than life presence\" as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted \"Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer\" as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html \"Galactus is number 5\"] IGN, 2009.\n\nPublication history\n\nCreated by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character debuted in The Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as \"The Galactus Trilogy\").Thomas, Roy, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), \"Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy\", pp. 112–115. ; \n\nOrigin\n\nIn 1966, nearly five years after launching Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title, Fantastic Four, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the supervillain mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993,\n\nKirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the Silver Surfer:\n\nKirby elaborated, \"Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.\"Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert. [http://www.reocities.com/brenni_au/JackKirby.html \"The King\"] , Wizard #36, August 1994, via Brenni_Au/JackKirby (fan site).\n\nWriter Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: \"In five short years from the launch of the Fantastic Four, the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep.\"Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004.\n\nThis led to the introduction of Galactus in Fantastic Four #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling \"The Galactus Trilogy\".Thomas, Roy. Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing: New York City, 2006), p. 113. ; Lee, Stan, in Thomas, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe, audio commentary #37 Kirby did not intend Galactus to reappear, to preserve the character's awe-inspiring presence. Reprinted in  Fan popularity, however, prompted Lee to ask Kirby for Galactus's reappearance, and the character became a mainstay of the Marvel Universe.\n\n1960s\n\nTo preserve the character's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking cameos in Thor #134 (Nov. 1966), and Daredevil #37 (Feb. 1968), respectively. Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in Fantastic Four #72–77 (March–Aug. 1968).[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed Feb. 14, 2015) After a flashback appearance in Silver Surfer #1 (Aug. 1968), the character returned to Earth in Thor #160–162 (Jan. – March 1969). Galactus' origin was eventually revealed in Thor #168–169 (Sept. – Oct. 1969).\n\n1970s and 1980s\n\nThe character made appearances in Fantastic Four #120–123 (March – June 1972) and Thor #225–228 (July–Oct. 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in Fantastic Four #172–175 (July – Oct. 1976) and #206–213 (May – Dec. 1979).\n\nStan Lee and Jack Kirby reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot graphic novel The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience! in 1978. This Marvel Fireside Book, published by Simon & Schuster, was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983), inked by Vince Colletta and George Klein, lettered by John Morelli and colored by Andy Yanchus. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald, pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson and inker Jack Abel. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the core of the collapsing universe before the Big Bang; the story was later reprinted as Origin of Galactus #1 (Feb. 1996).\n\nThe character guest-starred in Rom #26–27 (Jan. – Feb. 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of Fantastic Four #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in Fantastic Four #262 (Jan. 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, Eternity, an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; Howard University professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist John Byrne of using the character to \"justify planetary-scale genocide.\"Singer, Marc. [http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html \"Byrne's Fantastic Four, or Optimism\"] Howling Curmudgeons (fan site), 18 May 2004.

Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it is revealed that after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, the planet eater returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.\n\nWriter-penciller John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced \"The Last Galactus Story\" as a serial in the anthology comic-magazine Epic Illustrated #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each was six pages with the exception of the eighth installment (12 pages). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.Byrne, John, [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID\n3&T1Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 \"Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'\"], \"Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines\", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Galactus played a pivotal role in the limited series Secret Wars #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the Silver Surfer (beginning with issue #1, July 1987).\n\nStan Lee and artist John Buscema also produced the 64-page hardcover Silver Surfer: Judgment Day (Oct. 1988), in which Galactus clashes with demonic entity Mephisto.\n\n1990s\n\nGalactus was featured in the miniseries Infinity Gauntlet #1–6 (July – Dec. 1991), Infinity War #1–6 (June – Nov. 1992) and Cosmic Powers #1–6 (March – Aug. 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries Galactus the Devourer (September 1999 – March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the story arc would occur in the third volume of Silver Surfer, but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a \"radical\" idea concerning \"why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.\"[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html \"Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning...\"], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d.

Issues #7–12, written by Keith Giffen, introduce Galactus' first herald (the Fallen One).\n\nGalactus's origin is re-examined in Fantastic Four #520–523 (Oct. 2004 – April 2005), in which the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill #1–6 (March – Aug. 2005) Galactus was a central character in the \"Annihilation\" storyline, appearing in the limited series Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1–4 (June – Sept. 2006), Annihilation #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007) and the epilogue, Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #1–2 (Feb. – April 2007).\n\nGalactus was an antagonist in Fantastic Four #545–546 (June – July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function Epoch. In Nova vol. 4, #13–15 (May – July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author Andy Lanning said that he and co-writer Dan Abnett were \"treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping.\"Rogers,Vaneta.

The planet Taa existed in the prime pre-Big Bang universe. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually begins killing off all of the other life in his universe, Galan and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the Big Crunch. Galan, however, does not die: when bonded with Sentience of the Universe he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the rubble of his ship that the current universe formed after the Big Bang. He emerged as Galactus and though a Watcher observed Galactus' birth and recognizes his destructive nature, the Watcher chose not to kill Galactus.Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983).

Visual effects studio Weta Digital convinced Fox to add hints of the character's comic-book appearance, including a shadow and a fiery mass inside the cosmic cloud resembling Galactus' signature helmet. Director Tim Story said he created Galactus as a cosmic cloud so a future Silver Surfer spin-off film would be unique as the character had yet to appear in comic-book form. Film writer J.

    "aggregatedText" : "Galactus is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a cosmic entity who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the primary Marvel continuity. Galactus was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in the comic book Fantastic Four #48, published in March 1966.\n\nLee and Kirby had desired to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain, culminating in the creation of Galactus. In the character's first appearance Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgments of mortal beings. Galactus' initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer Mark Gruenwald further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe that existed prior to the Big Bang which began the current universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the \"Sentience of the Universe\" to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by John Byrne, Jim Starlin, and Louise Simonson explored Galactus' role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the Silver Surfer), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.\n\nThe character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as arcade games, video games, animated television series, and the 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.\n\nIn 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on IGN's list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains\", citing the character's \"larger than life presence\" as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted \"Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer\" as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html \"Galactus is number 5\"] IGN, 2009.\n\nPublication history\n\nCreated by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character debuted in The Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as \"The Galactus Trilogy\").Thomas, Roy, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), \"Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy\", pp. 112–115. ; \n\nOrigin\n\nIn 1966, nearly five years after launching Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title, Fantastic Four, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the supervillain mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993,\n\nKirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the Silver Surfer:\n\nKirby elaborated, \"Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.\"Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert. [http://www.reocities.com/brenni_au/JackKirby.html \"The King\"] , Wizard #36, August 1994, via Brenni_Au/JackKirby (fan site).\n\nWriter Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: \"In five short years from the launch of the Fantastic Four, the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep.\"Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004.\n\nThis led to the introduction of Galactus in Fantastic Four #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling \"The Galactus Trilogy\".Thomas, Roy. Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing: New York City, 2006), p. 113. ; Lee, Stan, in Thomas, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe, audio commentary #37 Kirby did not intend Galactus to reappear, to preserve the character's awe-inspiring presence. Reprinted in  Fan popularity, however, prompted Lee to ask Kirby for Galactus's reappearance, and the character became a mainstay of the Marvel Universe.\n\n1960s\n\nTo preserve the character's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking cameos in Thor #134 (Nov. 1966), and Daredevil #37 (Feb. 1968), respectively. Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in Fantastic Four #72–77 (March–Aug. 1968).[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed Feb. 14, 2015) After a flashback appearance in Silver Surfer #1 (Aug. 1968), the character returned to Earth in Thor #160–162 (Jan. – March 1969). Galactus' origin was eventually revealed in Thor #168–169 (Sept. – Oct. 1969).\n\n1970s and 1980s\n\nThe character made appearances in Fantastic Four #120–123 (March – June 1972) and Thor #225–228 (July–Oct. 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in Fantastic Four #172–175 (July – Oct. 1976) and #206–213 (May – Dec. 1979).\n\nStan Lee and Jack Kirby reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot graphic novel The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience! in 1978. This Marvel Fireside Book, published by Simon & Schuster, was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983), inked by Vince Colletta and George Klein, lettered by John Morelli and colored by Andy Yanchus. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald, pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson and inker Jack Abel. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the core of the collapsing universe before the Big Bang; the story was later reprinted as Origin of Galactus #1 (Feb. 1996).\n\nThe character guest-starred in Rom #26–27 (Jan. – Feb. 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of Fantastic Four #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in Fantastic Four #262 (Jan. 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, Eternity, an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; Howard University professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist John Byrne of using the character to \"justify planetary-scale genocide.\"Singer, Marc.

Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it is revealed that after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, the planet eater returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.\n\nWriter-penciller John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced \"The Last Galactus Story\" as a serial in the anthology comic-magazine Epic Illustrated #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each was six pages with the exception of the eighth installment (12 pages). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.Byrne, John, [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID\n3&T1Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 \"Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'\"], \"Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines\", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Galactus played a pivotal role in the limited series Secret Wars #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the Silver Surfer (beginning with issue #1, July 1987).\n\nStan Lee and artist John Buscema also produced the 64-page hardcover Silver Surfer: Judgment Day (Oct. 1988), in which Galactus clashes with demonic entity Mephisto.\n\n1990s\n\nGalactus was featured in the miniseries Infinity Gauntlet #1–6 (July – Dec. 1991), Infinity War #1–6 (June – Nov. 1992) and Cosmic Powers #1–6 (March – Aug. 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries Galactus the Devourer (September 1999 – March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the story arc would occur in the third volume of Silver Surfer, but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a \"radical\" idea concerning \"why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.\"[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html \"Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning...\"], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d.

The character features in the first six issues of the series Thanos (Dec. 2003 – May 2004), written by Jim Starlin. Issues #7–12, written by Keith Giffen, introduce Galactus' first herald (the Fallen One).\n\nGalactus's origin is re-examined in Fantastic Four #520–523 (Oct. 2004 – April 2005), in which the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill #1–6 (March – Aug. 2005) Galactus was a central character in the \"Annihilation\" storyline, appearing in the limited series Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1–4 (June – Sept. 2006), Annihilation #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007) and the epilogue, Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #1–2 (Feb. – April 2007).\n\nGalactus was an antagonist in Fantastic Four #545–546 (June – July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function Epoch. In Nova vol. 4, #13–15 (May – July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author Andy Lanning said that he and co-writer Dan Abnett were \"treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping.\"Rogers,Vaneta.

The planet Taa existed in the prime pre-Big Bang universe. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually begins killing off all of the other life in his universe, Galan and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the Big Crunch. Galan, however, does not die: when bonded with Sentience of the Universe he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the rubble of his ship that the current universe formed after the Big Bang. He emerged as Galactus and though a Watcher observed Galactus' birth and recognizes his destructive nature, the Watcher chose not to kill Galactus.Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983).
