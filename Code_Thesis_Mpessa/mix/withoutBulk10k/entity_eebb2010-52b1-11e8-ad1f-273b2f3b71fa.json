  "textBody" : "The foreign relations of Eritrea are the policies of the Eritrean government by which it administers its external relations with other nations. Since its independence, Eritrea's foreign relations have been dominated by conflict and confrontation, both in the regional and international arenas. It has maintained often troubled, and usually violent, relations with its neighbors, including brief armed conflicts with Yemen and Djibouti and a destructive war with its bigger-neighbour, Ethiopia.Nur, Salih O. (2013) \"Foreign Policy of Eritrea: Explained in the Light of Democratic Peace Proposition.\" International Journal of Peace and Development Studies 4(2): 23 At present, Eritrea has very tense relations with neighboring Ethiopia and Djibouti. Relations in the international arena also have been strained since the last decade, particularly with major powers. What appeared cordial relations with the US in the 1990s turned acrimonious following the border with Ethiopia, 1998-2000.Nur, Salih O. (2013) \"Foreign Policy of Eritrea: Explained in the Light of Democratic Peace Proposition.\" International Journal of Peace and Development Studies 4(2): 23 Although the two nations have a close working relationship regarding the ongoing war on terror, there has been a growing tension in other areas. Ties with international organizations such as the UN, African Union, and the EU have also been complicated in part because of Eritrea's outrage at their reluctance to force Ethiopia to accept a boundary commission ruling issued in 2002.Nur, Salih O. (2013) \"Foreign Policy of Eritrea: Explained in the Light of Democratic Peace Proposition.\" International Journal of Peace and Development Studies 4(2): 23\n\nInternational organizations\n\nEritrea is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, and is an observing member of the Arab League.\n\nEritrea holds a seat on the United Nations' Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ).\n\nEritrea also holds memberships in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), Non-Aligned Movement, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Customs Organization.\n\nArmenia\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 16 October 1994.\n\nEthiopia\n\nEritrea's foreign relations with Ethiopia are adversarial.  Immediately after Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia, relations were cordial despite the former relationship. Since independence Eritrea's relationship with Ethiopia was entirely political, especially in the resuscitation and expansion of IGAD's scope. Since 1998 and the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, the relationship became increasingly hostile.\n\nIn December 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a peace treaty ending their war and created a pair of binding judicial commissions, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission and the Eritrean-Ethiopian Claims Commission,  to rule on their disputed border and related claims. On April 2002 The Commission released its decision (with a clarification in 2003). Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war. Since these decisions Ethiopia has refused to permit the physical demarcation of the border while Eritrea insists the border must be demarcated as defined by the Commission. Consequently, the Boundary Commission ruled boundary as virtually demarcated and effective.\n\nEritrea maintains a military force on its border with Ethiopia roughly equal in size to Ethiopia's force, which has required a general mobilization of a significant portion of the population. Eritrea has viewed this border dispute as an existential threat to itself in particular and the African Union in general, because it deals with the supremacy of colonial boundaries in Africa. Since the border conflict Ethiopia no longer uses Eritrean ports for its trade.\n\nDuring the border conflict and since, Ethiopia has fostered militants against Eritrea (including ethnic separatists and religiously based organizations). Eritrea has retaliated by hosting militant groups against Ethiopia as well. The United Nations Security Council argues that Eritrea and Ethiopia have expanded their dispute to a second theater, Somalia.\n\nOn March 2012, Ethiopia attacked Eritrean army outposts along the border. Addis Ababa said the assault was in retaliation for the training and support given by Asmara to subversives while Eritrea said the U.S knew of the attacks, an accusation denied by US officials.[http://www.voanews.com/content/eritrean_president_discusses_path_to_development/727263.html \"Eritrean President Discusses Path to Development\", May 18, 2012.]\n\nIsrael\n\nEritrea developed relations with Israel shortly after gaining its independence in 1993, despite protests among Arab countries. Israeli-Eritrean relations are close. The president of Eritrea has visited Israel for medical treatment.[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-74229912.html Eritrea-Israel relations] However, Eritrea condemned Israeli military action during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict.[https://www.webcitation.org/5e5lajuRb?url=http://www.shabait.com/staging/publish/article_009246.html WebCite query result] Israeli-Eritrean ties are complicated by Israel's close ties to Ethiopia, who have shared an unfriendly dyad with Eritrea for a long time.\n\nQatar\n\nDuring the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Eritrea refused a request by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to cut relations with Qatar, citing its \"strong ties with the brother people of Qatar.\"\n\nSouth Korea\n\nDiplomatic relations between the Republic of Korea and the State of Eritrea were established on 24 May 1993.http://www.mofa.go.kr/ENG/countries/middleeast/countries/20070804/1_24479.jsp?menu=m_30_50\n\nSudan\n\nEritrea broke diplomatic relations with the Sudan in December 1994. This action was taken after a long period of increasing tension between the two countries due to a series of cross-border incidents involving the Eritrean Islamic Jihad (EIJ). Although the attacks did not pose a threat to the stability of the Government of Eritrea (the infiltrators have generally been killed or captured by government forces), the Eritreans believe the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Khartoum supported, trained, and armed the insurgents. After many months of negotiations with the Sudanese to try to end the incursions, the Government of Eritrea concluded that the NIF did not intend to change its policy and broke relations. Subsequently, the Government of Eritrea hosted a conference of Sudanese opposition leaders in June 1995 in an effort to help the opposition unite and to provide a credible alternative to the present government in Khartoum.  Eritrea resumed diplomatic relations with Sudan on December 10, 2005. Since then, Sudan has accused Eritrea, along with Chad, of supporting rebels.[http://www.afrol.com/printable_article/13898 Eritrea, Chad accused of aiding Sudan rebels] , afrol News, September 7. Retrieved 2009-03-15\nThe undemarcated border with Sudan previously posed a problem for Eritrean external relations.\n\nAfter a high-level delegation to the Sudan from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ties are being normalized. While normalization of ties continues, Eritrea has been recognized as a broker for peace between the separate factions of the Sudanese civil war. \"It is known that Eritrea played a role in bringing about the peace agreement [between the Southern Sudanese and Government],\" while the Sudanese Government and Eastern Front rebels have requested Eritrea to mediate peace talks.\nThe Eritrean President, Isaias Afewerki, and his Sudanese counterpart Omar Al-Bashir held talks in Asmara on a number of bilateral issues of mutual concern to the two East African countries. The talks dealt with enhancing bilateral ties and cooperation including making their shared border more open. Sudan and Eritrea agreed to abolish entry visa requirements, opening their common borders for free movement of both nationals.[http://www.sudantribune.com/Eritrean-Sudanese-leaders-hold,42703 \"Eritrean, Sudanese leaders hold talks in Asmara] In 2011, Eritrea and Sudan cooperated in the building of the  Kassala-Al Lafa Highway linking the two countries.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nThe United Arab Emirates are a member of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels in Yemen. Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed is quoted stating the UAE are using \"logistical facilities at the port and airport\" in the southern city of Assab. Human Rights Watch reported that the UAE maintains a detention facility at the Assab base, where it may have transferred high-profile prisoners out of Yemen.\n\nUnited States\n\nDiplomatic relations between The United States and The State of Eritrea were established on May 24, 1993.\n\nYemen\n\nA dispute with Yemen over the Hanish Islands in 1996 resulted in a brief war. As part of an agreement to cease hostilities, the nations agreed to refer the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. At the conclusion of the proceedings, both nations acquiesced to the 1998 decision which said sovereignty should be shared.",
