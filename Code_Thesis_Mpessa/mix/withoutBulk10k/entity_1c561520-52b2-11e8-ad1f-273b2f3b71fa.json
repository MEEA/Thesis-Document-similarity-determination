En route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters. This correspondence now forms a central part of the later collection known as the Apostolic Fathers. His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology. Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops. In speaking of the authority of the church, he was the first to use the phrase \"catholic church\" in writing,Thurston, Herbert. \"Catholic.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3.

Tradition identifies Ignatius, along with his friend Polycarp, as disciples of John the Apostle. Later in his life, Ignatius was chosen to serve as Bishop of Antioch; the fourth-century Church historian Eusebius writes that Ignatius succeeded Evodius.[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Historia Ecclesiastica, Book III Chapter 22] In an attempt to make his apostolic succession even more immediate, Theodoret of Cyrrhus claimed that St. Peter himself left directions that Ignatius be appointed to the episcopal see of Antioch.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/IGNATIUS.htm \"St. Ignatius of Antioch\", Lives of Saints, John J. Crawley & Co.,Inc.] Ignatius called himself Theophorus (God Bearer). A tradition arose that he was one of the children whom Jesus took in his arms and blessed.The Martyrdom of Ignatius \n\nIgnatius' own writings mention his arrest by the authorities and travel to Rome to face trial:\n\nDuring the journey to Rome, Ignatius and his entourage of soldiers made a number of stops in Asia Minor. Along the route Ignatius wrote six letters to the churches in the region and one to a fellow bishop, Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna. In his Chronicle, Eusebius gives the date of Ignatius's death as AA 2124 (2124 years after Abraham), i.e. the 11th year of Trajan's reign, AD 108.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm Chronicle, from the Latin translation of Jerome, p. 276.] Although Ignatius himself wrote that he would be thrown to the beasts, \"lions\" are explicitly mentioned first in the fourth century by Jerome, and John Chrysostom is the first to allude to the Colosseum as the place of Ignatius' martyrdom.\n\nAccording to scholastic inference, after Ignatius' martyrdom in the Circus Maximus his remains were carried back to Antioch by his companions and were interred outside the city gates. The reputed remains of Ignatius were moved by the Emperor Theodosius II to the Tychaeum, or Temple of Tyche, which had been converted into a church dedicated to Ignatius. In 637 the relics were transferred to the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome.\n\nVeneration\n\nIgnatius' feast day was kept in his own Antioch on 17 October, the day on which he is now celebrated in the Catholic Church and generally in western Christianity, although from the 12th century until 1969 it was put at 1 February in the General Roman Calendar.[https://books.google.com/books?id_zJJtvK2_KsC&pg\nPA220&dqIgnatius+antioch+feast&hl\nen&saX&ei\nWGikU_OaOcnD7Aa_uYCwDQ&redir_escy#v\nonepage&qIgnatius%20antioch%20feast&f\nfalse Farmer, David .

Killen regarded all the Ignatian epistles, beginning with that to the Romans, as having been pseudepigraphically composed in the early 3rd century. His reasons included their episcopal emphasis, which is otherwise unknown before the reign of Callistus, the Bishop of Rome around 220. Most scholars, however, accept at least the two Ignatian epistles which were referenced by Origen,[http://www.depts.drew.edu/jhc/KillenIgnatius.pdf Killen, William P., The Ignatian Epistles Entirely Spurious, T. & T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1886] and believe that by the 5th century, this collection had been enlarged by spurious letters. The original text of six of the seven authentic letters are found in the Codex Mediceo Laurentianus written in Greek in the 11th century (which also contains the pseudepigraphical letters of the Long Recension, except that to the Philippians), while the letter to the Romans is found in the Codex Colbertinus.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07644a.htm O'Connor, John Bonaventure. \"St. Ignatius of Antioch.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 15 Feb. 2016 Some of the original letters were, at one point, believed to had been changed with interpolations. The oldest is known as the \"Long Recension\" which dates from the latter part of the fourth century. These were created to posthumously enlist Ignatius as an unwitting witness in theological disputes of that age, but that position was vigorously combated by several British and German critics, including the Catholics Denzinger and Hefele, who defended the genuineness of the entire seven epistles. At the same time, the purported eye-witness account of his martyrdom is also thought to be a forgery from around the same time. A detailed but spurious account of Ignatius' arrest and his travails and martyrdom is the material of the Martyrium Ignatii which is presented as being an eyewitness account for the church of Antioch, and attributed to Ignatius' companions, Philo of Cilicia, deacon at Tarsus, and Rheus Agathopus, a Syrian.\n\nAlthough James Ussher regarded it as genuine, if there is any genuine nucleus of the Martyrium, it has been so greatly expanded with interpolations that no part of it is without questions. Its most reliable manuscript is the 10th-century Codex Colbertinus (Paris), in which the Martyrium closes the collection. The Martyrium presents the confrontation of the bishop Ignatius with Trajan at Antioch, a familiar trope of Acta of the martyrs, and many details of the long, partly overland voyage to Rome. The Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria says that he was thrown to the wild beasts that devoured him and rent him to pieces.[http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/4_24.html#1 \"Synaxarium: The Martyrdom of St. Ignatius, and Patriarch of Antioch\", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]\n\nIgnatius's letters proved to be important testimony to the development of Christian theology, since the number of extant writings from this period of Church history is very small. They bear signs of being written in great haste and without a proper plan, such as run-on sentences and an unsystematic succession of thought.\n\nIgnatius modeled his writings after Paul, Peter, and John, and even quoted or paraphrased their own works freely, such as when he quoted 1 Cor 1:18, in his letter to the Ephesians: \"Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal.\" - Letter to the Ephesians 18, Roberts and Donaldson translation[http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch A Pinch on Incense, (Ted Byfield, ed.), p. 50]\n\nChristology \n\nIgnatius is known to have taught the deity of Christ: \nAlso in the interpolated text of the 4th Century Long Recension: \n\nHe stressed the value of the Eucharist, calling it a \"medicine of immortality\" (Ignatius to the Ephesians 20:2). The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the arena, which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places, may seem quite odd to the modern reader. An examination of his theology of soteriology shows that he regarded salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death and thus to bravely face martyrdom.Cobb, L. Stephanie. Dying To Be Men: Gender and Language in Early Christian Martyr Texts, page 3 (Columbia University Press, 2008); \n\nIgnatius is claimed to be the first known Christian writer to argue in favor of Christianity's replacement of the Sabbath with the Lord's Day: \n\nEcclesiology \n\nIgnatius is the earliest known Christian writer to emphasize loyalty to a single bishop in each city (or diocese) who is assisted by both presbyters (elders) and deacons. Earlier writings only mention either bishops or presbyters.\n\nFor instance, his writings on bishops, presbyters and deacons: \n\nHe is also responsible for the first known use of the Greek word katholikos (καθολικός), meaning \"universal\", \"complete\" and \"whole\" to describe the church, writing: \n\nIt is from the word katholikos (\"according to the whole\") that the word catholic comes. When Ignatius wrote the Letter to the Smyrnaeans in about the year 107 and used the word catholic, he used it as if it were a word already in use to describe the Church. This has led many scholars to conclude that the appellation Catholic Church with its ecclesial connotation may have been in use as early as the last quarter of the 1st century. On the Eucharist, he wrote in his letter to the Smyrnaeans: \n\nIn his letter addressed to the Christians of Rome, he entreats to do nothing to prevent his martyrdom.\n\nLetters of Pseudo-Ignatius\n\nEpistles attributed to Saint Ignatius but of spurious origin include[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0114.htm \"Spurious Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch\" at NewAdvent.org]\n*Epistle to the Tarsians;\n*Epistle to the Antiochians;\n*Epistle to Hero, a Deacon of Antioch;\n*Epistle to the Philippians;\n*The Epistle of Maria the Proselyte to Ignatius;\n*Epistle to Mary at Neapolis, Zarbus;\n*First Epistle to St. John;\n*Second Epistle to St. John;\n*The Epistle of Ignatius to the Virgin Mary.",
