The goal of the process is to increase the pH of acidic paper on a large scale. Although acid-free paper has become more common, a large body of acidic paper still exists in books made after the 1850s because of its cheaper and simpler production methods. Acidic paper, especially when exposed to light, air pollution, or high relative humidity, yellows and becomes brittle over time.Cheradame, H et al.

URL accessed December 1, 2007.\n\nHistory of research and process development\n\nMass deacidification - along with microfilm and lamination - was developed during the early- and mid-20th century as a response to the chemical process of hydrolysis by which the fibers that constitute paper, providing its structure and strength, have their bonds broken, resulting in paper that becomes increasingly brittle over time. Environmental pollutants can react with paper to form acids that promote oxidation, creating more acid as a by-product, which results in a positive feedback loop of autocatalytic destruction.Library of Congress. (1994). An evaluation of the BookKeeper mass deacidification process: Technical Evaluation Team Report for the Preservation Directorate, Library of Congress, Appendix E. Supported in part by grants from the Council on Library Resources, William J. Barrow conducted research into paper decay and found that no more than three percent of the books published between 1900 and 1949 would survive more than fifty years. In response to this, a Standing Committee on the Preservation of Research Library Materials was formed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in 1960.Marcum, D. & Friedlander, D. (2003). [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may03/friedlander/05friedlander.html Keepers of the Crumbling Culture: What Digital Preservation Can Learn from Library History]. URL accessed April 28, 2008.\n\nBarrow also invented an aqueous process to neutralize acid in paper while depositing an alkaline buffer that would retard the rate of decay.Ritzenthaler, M. (1993). Preserving Archives and Manuscripts, . In addition to Barrow’s original method, both non-aqueous - employing organic solvents - and vaporous - the Library of Congress’ DEZ (diethyl zinc) treatment - methods of achieving the same results have been researched in an attempt to reduce time, labor, and cost requirements.Pillete, R. (2003). [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla69/papers/030e-Pilette.pdf Mass Deacidification: A Preservation Option for Libraries] World Library and Information Congress: 69th IFLA General Conference and Council. URL accessed April 28, 2008.\n\nOne technique proposed was to place books in an evacuated chamber, then introduce diethylzinc (DEZ). In theory, the diethylzinc would react with acidic residues in the paper, leaving an alkaline residue that would protect the paper against further degradation.Porck, H. (1996). Mass deacidification. An update of possibilities and limitations. [http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa/PUBL/porck5.htm DEZ] . URL accessed December 2, 2007. In practice, the heating required to remove trace water from the books before reaction (DEZ reacts violently with water) caused an accelerated degradation of the paper, and a range of other chemical reactions between DEZ and other components of the book (glues, bindings) caused further damage and the production of unpleasant smells. Regardless, in the 1980s, a pilot plant for mass deacidification using this process was constructed by NASA and was tested on books provided by the Library of Congress.Harris, K. & Shahani, C. (1994) Library of Congress. Preservation.\n[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/deacid/proceva1.html Mass deacidification: An initiative to refine the diethyl zinc process] URL accessed December 1, 2007. However, it was discovered in 1986 that the DEZ had not been removed in one of the deacidification runs and was pooled in the bottom of the chamber, and probably remained within some of the plumbing. DEZ is violently flammable when it comes in contact with either oxygen or water vapor, so the vacuum chamber could not be opened to remove the books within. Eventually, explosives were used to rupture the suspect plumbing; suspicions of the presence of residual DEZ were confirmed by the subsequent fire that destroyed the plant. In his book Double Fold,  Nicholson Baker discusses the failure of the NASA program at great length.\n\nThe chemical company Akzo made later attempts at refining the process; though the risks of fire and explosions were reduced by better process design, damage and odours remained a problem. In the end, Akzo decided the process was not a viable commercial proposition, and shut down their research at the end of 1994.\n\nAdoption and costs\n\nWhile deacidification has been adopted by major research libraries such as the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, it is not clear that many archives, particularly those in the United States, have followed suit. Whereas some European national archives have tested deacidification techniques, the United States’ National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which pioneered an aqueous technique that improved upon Barrow’s, has chosen to invest its preservation dollars elsewhere. In 2000, the Chief of the NARA Document Conservation Laboratory defended the lack of a mass deacidification program by pointing to differences between library and archival collections, for example noting that many of the papers coming to NARA were of a higher quality than those in library collections; that the Archives does not receive records from federal government agencies until they are at least 30 years old, by which time acidic paper will have already been\nirrevocably weakened; and that limited resources might best be applied elsewhere, such as climate control, as under the Archives' Twenty-Year Preservation Plan, the emphasis was on \"maximum benefit for the greatest number of records.\"Jones, N. (2000).

Studies conducted by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center and the General State Archive of the Netherlands found the DEZ method, properly used, might be particularly applicable to archival materials.Harris, K. & Shahani, C. (1994). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/deacid/dezeval.html Mass Deacidification: An Initiative to Refine the Diethyl Zinc Process] It was estimated that deacidification costs, excluding transportation and handling, during the early 1990s was $5–10 per volume.Sparks, Peter G.

During 1995-1997, the Library of Congress received $2 million in appropriations to deacidify 72,000 books using the Bookkeeper commercial method and evaluate alternative methods.
