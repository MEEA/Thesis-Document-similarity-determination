  "textBody" : "Quintus Ennius (; c. 239 – c. 169 BC) was a writer and poet who lived during the Roman Republic. He is often considered the father of Roman poetry. He was born in Rudiae,: \"Rudiae is celebrated as the birthplace of Ennius\" formerly a small town located near modern Lecce in the heel of Italy (ancient Calabria, today Salento), and could speak Oscan as well as Latin and Greek. Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in Latin literature was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.\n\nBiography\n\nVery little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings.E. Badian, “Ennius and his Friends” in Ennius, Fondation Hardt, Geneva 1972, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id-Se1MLtw658C&printsec\nfrontcover#vonepage&q&f\nfalse pp.149-99] Some lines of the Annales, as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer Homer informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius. It is true that the doctrine of the transmigration of souls once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by Maurus Servius Honoratus that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district.Commentary on the Aeneid, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D691 vii. 691] The partly Hellenised city of Rudiae, his place of  birth, was certainly in the area settled by the Messapians. And this, he used to say, according to Aulus Gellius, had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as \"three hearts… Greek, Oscan and Latin”.Noctes Atticae [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus:text:2007.01.0072:id=v3.p.263 17.17.1]\n\nThe public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of centurion during the Second Punic War.  While in Sardinia in the year 204 BC, he is said to have attracted the attention of Cato the Elder and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were Scipio Africanus and Fulvius Nobilior, whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of Ambracia, at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the Annales. It was through the influence of Nobilior's son Quintus that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the Aventine Hill with the poet Caecilius Statius, a fellow adapter of Greek plays. \n\nAt about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy Thyestes. In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the Olympic Games, obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: “Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.”Most of this section is drawn from the 1911 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nLiterature\n\nEnnius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style (praetextae and palliatae), as well as his most famous work, a historic epic in hexameters called the Annales. Other minor works include the  Epicharmus,  the Euhemerus, the Hedyphagetica, and Saturae.\n\nThe Epicharmus presented an account of the gods and the physical operations of the universe.  In it, the poet dreamed he had been transported after death to some place of heavenly enlightenment.\n\nThe Euhemerus presented a theological doctrine of a vastly different type in a mock-simple prose style modelled on the Greek of Euhemerus of Messene and several other theological writers.  According to this doctrine, the gods of Olympus were not supernatural powers still actively intervening in the affairs of men, but great generals, statesmen and inventors of olden times commemorated after death in extraordinary ways.\n\nThe Hedyphagetica took much of its substance from the gastronomical epic of Archestratus of Gela.  The eleven extant hexameters have prosodical features avoided in the more serious Annales.\n\nThe remains of six books of Saturae show a considerable variety of metres.  There are signs that Ennius varied the metre sometimes even within a composition.  A frequent theme was the social life of Ennius himself and his upper-class Roman friends and their intellectual conversation.\n\nThe Annales was an epic poem in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of Troy in 1184 BC down to the censorship of Cato the Elder in 184 BC.  It was the first Latin poem to adopt the dactylic hexameter metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry, leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry.  The Annals became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by Virgil's Aeneid. About 600 lines survive. A copy of the work is among the Latin rolls of the Herculaneum library.",
