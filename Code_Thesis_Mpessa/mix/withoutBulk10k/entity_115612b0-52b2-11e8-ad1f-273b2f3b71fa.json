  "textBody" : "Harwich is a town in Essex, England and one of the Haven ports, located on the coast with the North Sea to the east. It is in the Tendring district. Nearby places include Felixstowe to the northeast, Ipswich to the northwest, Colchester to the southwest and Clacton-on-Sea to the south. It is the northernmost coastal town within Essex.\n\nIts position on the estuaries of the Stour and Orwell rivers and its usefulness to mariners as the only safe anchorage between the Thames and the Humber led to a long period of maritime significance, both civil and military. The town became a naval base in 1657 and was heavily fortified,Trollope, C., \"The Defences of Harwich\", Fort (Fortress Study Group), 1982, (10), pp5-31 with Harwich Redoubt, Beacon Hill Battery, and Bath Side Battery.\n\nHarwich today is contiguous with Dovercourt and the two, along with Parkeston, are often referred to collectively as Harwich.\n\nHistory\n\nThe town's name means \"military settlement\", from Old English here-wic.[https://books.google.com/books?idPzIer-wYbnQC&pg\nPA152&lpgPA152&dq\nharwich+military+settlement&sourcebl&ots\nOF_uuFNMyw&sigfLhEb4KSJS4YXP_bXFlipo0q9Ig&hl\nen&ei4Kt7S_X7C4PlkAWEi638BA&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum9&ved\n0CCgQ6AEwCA#vonepage&q\nharwich%20military%20settlement&f=false Adrian Room, Placenames of the World (2003), \"Harwich\"]. Retrieved 20 December 2010\n\nThe town received its charter in 1238, although there is evidence of earlier settlement – for example, a record of a chapel in 1177, and some indications of a possible Roman presence.\n\nBecause of its strategic position, Harwich was the target for the invasion of Britain by William of Orange on 11 November 1688. However, unfavourable winds forced his fleet to sail into the English Channel instead and eventually land at Torbay. Due to the involvement of the Schomberg family in the invasion, Charles Louis Schomberg was made Marquess of Harwich.\n\nWriter Daniel Defoe devotes a few pages to the town in A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain. Visiting in 1722, he noted its formidable fort and harbour \"of a vast extent\".Daniel Defoe, A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724-1726) [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id\nDefoe&c_id3&p_id\n44 Available online here] The town, he recounts, was also known for an unusual spring rising on Beacon Hill (a promontory to the north-east of the town), which \"petrified\" clay, allowing it to be used to pave Harwich's streets and build its walls. The locals also claimed that \"the same spring is said to turn wood into iron\", but Defoe put this down to the presence of \"copperas\" in the water. Regarding the atmosphere of the town, he states: \"Harwich is a town of hurry and business, not much of gaiety and pleasure; yet the inhabitants seem warm in their nests and some of them are very wealthy\".\n\nRoyal Naval Dockyard\n\nHarwich Dockyard was established as a Royal Navy Dockyard in 1652. It ceased to operate as a Royal Dockyard in 1713 (though a Royal Navy presence was maintained until 1829). During the Second World War parts of Harwich were again requisitioned for naval use, and ships were based at HMS Badger; Badger was decommissioned in 1946, but the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service maintained a headquarters on the site until 1992.\n\nPort\n\nThe Royal Navy is no longer present in Harwich but Harwich International Port at nearby Parkeston continues to offer regular ferry services to the Hook of Holland (Hoek van Holland) in the Netherlands. Many operations of the large container port at Felixstowe and of Trinity House, the lighthouse authority, are managed from Harwich.\n\nThe port is famous for the phrase \"Harwich for the Continent\", seen on road signs and in  London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) advertisements.[http://www.ssplprints.com/image.php?id80928 'Harwich for the Continent', LNER poster][http://www.ssplprints.com/image.php?id\n80868 'Harwich for the Continent ', LNER poster, 1934]\n\nLighthouses\n\nAt least three pairs of lighthouses have been built over recent centuries as leading lights, to help guide vessels into Harwich. The earliest pair were wooden structures: the High Light stood on top of the old Town Gate, whilst the Low Light (featured in a painting by Constable) stood on the foreshore. Both were coal-fired.\n\nIn 1818 these were replaced by stone structures, designed by John Rennie Senior, which can still be seen today (they no longer function as lighthouses: one houses the town's maritime museum, the other is (in 2015) also being converted into a museum). They were owned by General Rebow of Wivenhoe Park, who was able to charge 1d per ton on all cargo entering the port, for upkeep of the lights. In 1836 Rebow's lease on the lights was purchased by Trinity House, but in 1863 they were declared redundant due to a change the position of the channel used by ships entering and leaving the port, caused by shifting sands.\n\nThey were in turn replaced by the pair of cast iron lights at nearby Dovercourt; these too remain in situ, but were decommissioned (again due to shifting of the channel) in 1917.\n\nImage:Harwich lighthouse by John Constable c1820.jpg|Painting of Harwich lighthouse by John Constable c.1820.\nImage:Harwich Maritime Museum - geograph.org.uk - 540656.jpg|The Harwich Low Lighthouse of 1818\nImage:Tall lighthouse - geograph.org.uk - 539381.jpg|Dovercourt High Light (1863)\nImage:Low lighthouse, Dovercourt - geograph.org.uk - 748617.jpg|Dovercourt Low Light (1863)\n\nArchitecture \n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, its small size Harwich is highly regarded in terms of architectural heritage, and the whole of the older part of the town, excluding Navyard Wharf, is a conservation area.[http://www.harwich-society.co.uk/old/info_navyard.htm Harwich Society, 2008.]\n\nThe regular street plan with principal thoroughfares connected by numerous small alleys indicates the town’s medieval origins, although many buildings of this period are hidden behind 18th century facades.\n\nThe extant medieval structures are largely private homes.  The house featured in the image of Kings Head St to the left is unique in the town and is an example of a sailmaker's house, thought to have been built circa 1600.  Notable public buildings include the parish church of St. Nicholas (1821)[http://www.ukattraction.com/east-of-england/st-nicholas-church.htm UK Attraction: St. Nicholas Church.] in a restrained Gothic style, with many original furnishings, including a somewhat altered organ in the west end gallery. There is also the Guildhall of 1769, the only Grade I listed building in Harwich.[http://www.harwich-society.co.uk/old/info_guildhall.htm Harwich Society, 2008.]\n\nThe Pier Hotel of 1860 and the building that was  the Great Eastern Hotel of 1864 can both been seen on the quayside, both reflecting the town's new importance to travellers following the arrival of the railway line from Colchester in 1854. In 1923, The Great Eastern Hotel was closed by the newly formed LNER, as the Great Eastern Railway had opened a new hotel with the same name at the new passenger port at Parkeston Quay, causing a decline in numbers.\nThe hotel became the Harwich Town Hall, which included the Magistrates Court and, following changes in local government, was sold and divided into apartments.\n\nAlso of interest are the High Lighthouse (1818), the unusual Treadwheel Crane (late 17th century), the Old Custom Houses on West Street, a number of Victorian shopfronts and the Electric Palace Cinema (1911), one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas to survive complete with its ornamental frontage and original projection room still intact and operational.\n\nThere is little notable building from the later parts of the 20th century, but major recent additions include the lifeboat station and two new structures for Trinity House. The Trinity House office building, next door to the Old Custom Houses, was completed in 2005. All three additions are influenced by the high-tech style.\n\nNotable residents\n\nHarwich has also historically hosted a number of notable inhabitants, linked with Harwich's maritime past.\n\n* Christopher Newport (1561–1617) seaman and privateer,  [http://www.captainchristophernewport.com/   Captain Christopher Newport website, Biography] retrieved January 2018  captain of the expedition that founded Jamestown, Virginia\n* Christopher Jones (c.1570–1622) Captain  [https://web.archive.org/web/20131019105711/http://www.harwich.net/histjones.htm   The Harwich Society, archive, Christopher Jones and the Mayflower Expedition 1620-1621] retrieved January 2018  of the 1620 voyage of the Pilgrim ship Mayflower\n* Richard Leake (1629–1696), master-gunner of England,  [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leake,_Richard_(DNB00)   Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 32, Leake, Richard] retrieved January 2018  son of Richard Leake, born at Harwich\n* William Shearman (1767–1861) physician  [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shearman,_William_(DNB00)  Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 52, Shearman, William] retrieved January 2018  and medical writer\n* James Francillon (1802–1866) barrister  [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Francillon,_James_(DNB00)   Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 20, Francillon, James] retrieved January 2018  and legal writer\n* Captain Charles Fryatt (1872–1916) mariner  [http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/fryatt_balfour.htm    Arthur Balfour's comments on Fryatt's execution, firstworldwar.com] retrieved January 2018  executed by the Germans, brought back from Belgium and buried at Dovercourt\n* Peter Firmin (born 1928) artist  [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278696/   IMDb Database] retrieved January 2018  and puppet maker\n* Randolph Stow (1935–2010) reclusive  [https://web.archive.org/web/20110224154217/http://www.cgg.wa.gov.au/notable-people/randolph-stow   Geraldton Regional Library, archive, Randolph Stow - Writer] retrieved January 2018  but award-winning Australian-born writer made his home in Harwich\n* Liana Bridges (born 1969) actress,  [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108770/   IMDb Database] retrieved January 2018  best known for co-presenting Sooty & Co\n* Kate Hall (born 1983) British-Danish  [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2520288/   IMDb Database] retrieved January 2018  singer\n\nPoliticians \n\n* Sir John Jacob, 1st Baronet of Bromley (c.1597–1666) politician [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/jacob-john-1597-1666  The History of Parliament Trust, JACOB, John (1597-1666)] retrieved January 2018  who sat in the House of Commons in 1640 and 1641\n* Sir Capel Luckyn, 2nd Baronet (1622–1680) politician [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/luckyn-capel-1622-80  The History of Parliament Trust, LUCKYN, Capel (1622-80)] retrieved January 2018  sat in the House of Commons variously between 1647 and 1679\n* Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) diarist [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/pepys-samuel-1633-1703  The History of Parliament Trust, PEPYS, Samuel (1633-1703)] retrieved January 2018  and Member of Parliament for Harwich\n* Sir Anthony Deane (1638–1721) Mayor of Harwich, [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/deane-sir-anthony-1633-1721  The History of Parliament Trust, DEANE, Sir Anthony (1633-1721)] retrieved January 2018  naval architect, Master Shipwright, commercial shipbuilder and MP\n* Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree OBE, PC, DL (1937–2012) Conservative politician  [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17510001   BBC News, 26 March 2012] retrieved January 2018  and former Cabinet member\n* Nick Alston (born 1952) Conservative  [http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/former-essex-police-and-crime-commissioner-among-list-of-five-new-deputy-lieutenants-1-5116012   East Anglian Daily Times, 20 July 2017, .....five new Deputy Lieutenants] retrieved January 2018  Essex Police and Crime Commissioner\n* Bernard Jenkin (born 1959) Conservative politician,  [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10312/bernard_jenkin/harwich_and_north_essex#profile   TheyWorkForYou website, Bernard Jenkin, MP, Harwich and North Essex] retrieved January 2018  MP for Harwich and North Essex since the 2010 \n* Andrew Murrison VR (born 1961) doctor  [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11132/andrew_murrison/south_west_wiltshire#profile   TheyWorkForYou website, Andrew Murrison, MP, South West Wiltshire] retrieved January 2018  and Conservative Party politician, MP 2001/2010\n* Rosalyn Warner better known as Mad Cow-Girl (1961 in Harwich – 2010) British nurse  [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/16/conservatives.terrorism   The Guardian, 16 Jun 2008, ...fight David Davis in bye-election...] retrieved January 2018  contested several elections for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party\n\nSport\n\nHarwich is home to Harwich & Parkeston F.C.;
