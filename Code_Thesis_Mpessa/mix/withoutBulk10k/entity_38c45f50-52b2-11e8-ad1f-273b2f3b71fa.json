It is a member of the World Trade Organization, the Commonwealth of Nations, La Francophonie, the African Union, the Southern Africa Development Community, the Indian Ocean Commission, COMESA, and the recently formed Indian Ocean Rim Association.\n\nTrade, commitment to democracy, and the country's small size are driving forces behind Mauritian foreign policy. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the European Union and its member states, particularly the United Kingdom and France. Mauritius' only immediate neighbour is Reunion Island, a overseas department of France that is also part of the European Union.\n\nConsidered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with other African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar and Mozambique. Mauritius coordinates much of its foreign policy with the Southern Africa Development Community and the Organisation of African Unity.  The country is also a member of the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA).\n\nRelations with France and India are strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Foreign embassies in Mauritius include Australia, South Korea the United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, Egypt, France, India, Madagascar, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Bangladesh and the United States.\n\nMauritius is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US-military (as covered under Article 98).\n\nInternational disputes\n\nMauritius claims the entire Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean and also claims the whole French-administered Tromelin Island.\n\nBilateral relations\n\nArmenia\n\n* Diplomatic relations between  Mauritius and Armenia were established on June 28, 2013.\n\nBangladesh\n\nBangladesh and Mauritius share a common heritage in culture and politics.

Bangladesh has a high commission in Port Louis.\n\nThe two countries are common members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the Commonwealth.\n\nCanada \n\nCanada and Mauritius established diplomatic relations in 1967.\n\nChina\n\nUnder the President of the People's Republic of China Hu Jintao in 2010, an investment package of $750m was allocated to Mauritius to develop the Jinfei Special Economic Zone which consists of 521-acre of land. Buildings of infrastructure and services primarily serving interests of Chinese companies operating the African region but would also eventually open up to foreign parties. The proposed investment package also includes development of advance logistic operations in Mauritius, construction of a university and an oceanographic research centre. This investment package is Mauritius' largest single foreign direct investment ever.\n\nCroatia\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on  September 30, 1997.[http://www.mvep.hr/en/foreign-politics/bilateral-relations/date-of-recognition-and-establishment-of-diplomatic-relations/][http://www.mvep.hr/en/foreign-politics/bilateral-relations/overview-by-country/seychelles,115.html]\n\nCyprus\n\n* Both countries are members of the Commonwealth of Nations\n* List of bilateral agreements.\n* Cyprus is represented in Mauritius through its embassy in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance has remained one of its biggest trading partners; in addition, the two countries share close cultural ties in language, media and literature.
