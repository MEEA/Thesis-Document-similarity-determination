His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi, a daughter of Prince Nakano (who was himself a son of Emperor Kanmu).Varley, p. 175. Uda had five Imperial consorts and 20 Imperial children.Brown, p. 289.  Particularly important sons include:\n\n* Prince Atsuhito (884–930).\n* Prince Atsuzane (敦実親王) (893-967).Kitagawa, Hiroshi et al. (1975). The Tale of the Heike, p. 503.\n\nHistorical background\n\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the Gempeitōkitsu (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (源氏), is  also known as Genji.  Some of Uda's grandchildren were granted the surname Minamoto (Minamoto is the most used surname for former Japanese royalty.). In order to distinguish Uda's descendants from other Minamoto clan families (源氏) or Genji, they became known as the Uda Genji (宇多源氏). Some of the Uda Genji moved to Ōmi Province and known as Sasaki clan (佐々木氏) or Ōmi Genji (近江源氏).\n\nAmong the Uda Genji, Minamoto no Masazane (源雅信), a son of Prince Atsumi (敦実親王) succeeded in the court. Masazane became sadaijin (Minister of the Left).  One of Masazane's daughters, Minamoto no Rinshi (源倫子) married Fujiwara no Michinaga and from this marriage three empresses dowagers and two regents (sesshō) were born.\n\nFrom Masanobu, several kuge families originated including the Niwata, Ayanokōji, Itsutsuji, Ōhara and Jikōji. From his fourth son Sukeyosi, the Sasaki clan originated, and thus Kyōgoku clan originated. These descendants are known as Ōmi Genji today. From this line, Sasaki Takauji made a success at the Muromachi shogunate and the Amago clan originated from his brother.\n\nEvents of Uda's life\n\nUda's father, Emperor Kōkō, demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence. Sadami was given the clan name of Minamoto and named Minamoto no Sadami. Later, in 887, when  Kōkō needed to appoint his successor, Sadami was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince rank with support of kampaku Fujiwara no Mototsune, since Sadami was adopted by a half-sister of Mototsune.  After the death of his father in November of that year, Sadami-shinnō ascended to the throne.\n\n* September 17, 887 (Ninna 3, 26th day of the 8th month):  Emperor Kōkō died; and his third son received the succession (senso).  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda formally acceded to the throne (sokui).Brown, p. 289; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.\n* January 4, 888 (Ninna 3, 17th day of the 11th month): Mototsune asked Uda for permission to retire from his duties; but the emperor is said to have responded, \"My youth limits my ability to govern; and if you stop offering me your good counsel, I will be obliged to abdicate and to retire to a monastery.\"  Therefore, Mototsune continued to serve as the new emperor's kampaku.Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n18oNAAAAIAAJ&pgPP9&dq\nnipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA126,M1  p. 126.]\n\n* 888 (Ninna 4, 8th month): Construction of the newly created Buddhist temple of  was completed; and a former disciple of Kōbō-daishi was installed as the new abbot.\n* 889 (Kanpyō 1, 10th month):  The former emperor Yōzei became deranged, and afflicted by mental illness. Yōzei would enter the palace and address courtiers he would meet with the greatest rudeness. He became increasingly furious.  He garroted women with the strings of musical instruments and then threw the bodies into a lake.  While riding on horseback, he directed his mount to run over people.  Sometimes he simply disappeared into the mountains where he chased wild boars and red deer.Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id18oNAAAAIAAJ&pg\nPP9&dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA127,M1  p. 127.]\n\nIn the beginning of Uda's reign, Mototsune held the office of kampaku (or chancellor). Emperor Uda's reign is marked by a prolonged struggle to reassert power by the Imperial Family away from the increasing influence of the Fujiwara, beginning with the death of Mototsune in 891.  Records show that shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda assigned scholars Sukeyo and Kiyoyuki, supporters of Mototsune, to provincial posts in the remote provinces of Mutsu and Higo respectively.  Meanwhile, non-Fujiwara officials mainly from the Minamoto family were promoted to prominent ranks, while his trusted counselor, Sugawara no Michizane rapidly rose in rank within five years to reach the third rank in the court, and supervision of the Crown Prince's household.  Meanwhile, Mototsune's son and heir, Fujiwara no Tokihira, rose in rank, but only just enough to prevent an open power struggle.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Uda attempted to return Court politics to the original spirit envisioned in the Ritsuryō Codes, while reviving intellectual interest in Confucian doctrine and culture.  In the seventh month of 896, Emperor Uda dispatched Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capitol and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused, in keeping with Chinese practices.  Emperor Uda also issued edicts reinforcing peasant land rights from encroachment by powerful families in the capital or monastic institutions, while auditing tax collections made in the provinces.\n\nEmperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China (\"ken-toh-shi\" 遣唐使).  The emperor's decision was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.Kitagawa, H. (1975). The Tale of the Heike, p. 222.\n\nThe Special Festival of the Kamo Shrine was first held during Uda's reign.Brown, p. 290.\n\nIn 897, Uda abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Prince Atsuhito, who would later come to be known as Emperor Daigo.  Uda left behind an hortatory will or testament which offered general admonitions or preceptsCompare Precepts of Tokugawa Ieyasu  for his son's guidance (see excerpt at right).  The document praises Fujiwara no Tokihira as an advisor but cautions against his womanizing; and Sugawara no Michizane is praised as Uda's mentor.  Both were assigned by Emperor Uda to look after his son until the latter reach maturity.\n\nThree years later, he entered the Buddhist priesthood at age 34 in 900.  Having founded the temple at Ninna-ji, Uda made it his new home after his abdication.\n\n  His Buddhist name was Kongō Kaku.  He was sometimes called \"the Cloistered Emperor of Teiji(亭子の帝),\" because the name of the Buddhist hall where he resided after becoming a priest was called Teijiin.\n\nUda died in 931 (Shōhei 1, 19th day of the 7th month) at the age of 65.Brown, p. 295; Varley, p. 179.\n\nThe actual site of Uda's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Uda's mausoleum.  It is formally named Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 420.\n\nThe former emperor is buried amongst the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ryoan-ji Temple in Kyoto.The \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ryoan-ji are the burial places of Uda, Kazan, Ichijō, Go-Suzaku, Go-Reizei, Go-Sanjō, and Horikawa. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Uda is today named O-uchiyama.  The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Uda died.  These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.Moscher, Gouverneur. (1978).
