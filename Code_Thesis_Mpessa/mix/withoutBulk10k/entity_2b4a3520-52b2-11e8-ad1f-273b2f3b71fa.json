However, in the modern language, both names have converged. commonly anglicised as Kenneth MacAlpin and known in most modern regnal lists as Kenneth I (810 – 13 February 858), was a king of the Picts who, according to national myth, was the first king of Scots.  He was thus later known by the posthumous nickname of , \"The Conqueror\".Skene, Chronicles, p. 83. The dynasty that ruled Scotland for much of the medieval period claimed descent from him, and the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II is descended from him through Malcolm III, Robert the Bruce and James VI and I.\n\nDisputed kingship\n\nThe Kenneth of myth, conqueror of the Picts and founder of the Kingdom of Alba, was born in the centuries after the real Kenneth died.  In the reign of Kenneth II (), when the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba was compiled, the annalist wrote:\n\nIn the 15th century, Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, a history in verse, added little to the account in the Chronicle:\n\nWhen humanist scholar George Buchanan wrote his history ' in the 1570s, a great deal of lurid detail had been added to the story. Buchanan included an account of how Kenneth's father had been murdered by the Picts and a detailed, and entirely unsupported, account of how Kenneth avenged him and conquered the Picts. Buchanan was not as credulous as many and he did not include the tale of MacAlpin's treason, a story from Gerald of Wales, who reused a tale of Saxon treachery at a feast in Geoffrey of Monmouth's inventive '.\n\nLater 19th-century historians, such as William Forbes Skene, brought new standards of accuracy to early Scottish history, while Celticists, such as Whitley Stokes and Kuno Meyer, cast a critical eye over Welsh and Irish sources. As a result, much of the misleading and vivid detail was removed from the scholarly series of events, even if it remained in the popular accounts. Rather than a conquest of the Picts, instead, the idea of Pictish matrilineal succession, mentioned by Bede and apparently the only way to make sense of the list of Kings of the Picts found in the Pictish Chronicle, advanced the idea that Kenneth was a Gael, and a king of , who had inherited the throne of Pictland through a Pictish mother. Other Gaels, such as  and , the sons of Fergus, were identified among the Pictish king lists, as were Angles such as Talorcen son of Eanfrith, and Britons such as Bridei son of Beli.That the Pictish succession was matrilineal is doubted. Bede in the Ecclesiastical History, I, i, writes: \"when any question should arise, they should choose a king from the female royal race, rather than the male: which custom, as is well known, has been observed among the Picts to this day.\" Bridei and Nechtan, the sons of Der-Ilei, were the Pictish kings in Bede's time, and are presumed to have claimed the throne through maternal descent. Maternal descent, \"when any question should arise\" brought several kings of Alba and the Scots to the throne, including John Balliol, Robert Bruce and Robert II, the first of the Stewart kings.\n\nLater historians would reject parts of the Kenneth produced by Skene and subsequent historians, while accepting others. Medievalist Alex Woolf, interviewed by The Scotsman in 2004, is quoted as saying:\n\nMany other historians could be quoted in terms similar to Woolf.For example, Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 107–108; Broun, \"Kenneth mac Alpin\"; Forsyth, \"Scotland to 1100\", pp. 28–32; Duncan, Kingship of the Scots, pp. 8–10. Woolf was selected to write the relevant volume of the new Edinburgh History of Scotland, to replace that written by Duncan in 1975.\n\nA feasible synopsis of the emerging consensus may be put forward, namely, that the kingships of Gaels and Picts underwent a process of gradual fusion,After Herbert, , kingship and identity in the ninth and\ntenth centuries, p. 71. starting with Kenneth, and rounded off in the reign of Constantine II. The Pictish institution of kingship provided the basis for merger with the Gaelic Alpin dynasty. The meeting of King Constantine and Bishop  at the Hill of Belief near the (formerly Pictish) royal city of Scone in 906 cemented the rights and duties of Picts on an equal basis with those of Gaels ('). Hence the change in styling from King of the Picts to King of . The legacy of Gaelic as the first national language of Scotland does not obscure the foundational process in the establishment of the Scottish kingdom of Alba.\n\nBackground\n\nKenneth's origins are uncertain, as are his ties, if any, to previous kings of the Picts or . Among the genealogies contained in the Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, dating from around 1130, is the supposed descent of Malcolm II of Scotland. Medieval genealogies are unreliable sources, but many historians still accept Kenneth's descent from the established , or at the very least from some unknown minor sept of the . The manuscript provides the following ancestry for Kenneth:... son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  ...Genealogies from Rawlinson B 502: [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G105003/text026.html ¶1696 Genelach Ríg n-Alban].\nLeaving aside the shadowy kings before  son of , the genealogy is certainly flawed insofar as , who died , could not reasonably be the son of , who was killed . The conventional account would insert two generations between  and : , father of , who died , and his father .\n\nAlthough later traditions provided details of his reign and death, Kenneth's father Alpin is not listed as among the kings in the , which provides the following sequence of kings leading up to Kenneth:\n\nNaoi m-bliadhna Cusaintin chain,\na naoi Aongusa ar Albain,\ncethre bliadhna Aodha áin,\nis a tri déug Eoghanáin.\nTríocha bliadhain Cionaoith chruaidh,\n\nThe nine years of  the fair,\nThe nine of  over ,\nThe four years of  the noble,\nAnd the thirteen of .\nThe thirty years of  the hardy,\n\nIt is supposed that these kings are the Constantine son of Fergus and his brother  (Angus II), who have already been mentioned, 's son  (), as well as the obscure , but this sequence is considered doubtful if the list is intended to represent kings of , as it should if Kenneth were king there.See Broun, Pictish Kings, for a discussion of this question.\n\nThat Kenneth was a Gael is not widely rejected, but modern historiography distinguishes between Kenneth as a Gael by culture and/or in ancestry, and Kenneth as a king of Gaelic . Kings of the Picts before him, from  son of , his brother  as well as  son of Fergus and his presumed descendants were all at least partly Gaelicised.For the descendants of the first  son of Fergus, again see Broun, Pictish Kings. The idea that the Gaelic names of Pictish kings in Irish annals represented translations of Pictish ones was challenged by the discovery of the inscription ', the latinised name of the Pictish king  son of Fergus, on the Dupplin Cross.Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 95–96; Fergus would appear as  in a Pictish form.\n\nOther evidence, such as that furnished by place-names, suggests the spread of Gaelic culture through western Pictland in the centuries before Kenneth. For example, Atholl, a name used in the Annals of Ulster for the year 739, has been thought to be \"New Ireland\", and Argyll derives from ', the land of the \"eastern Gaels\".\n\nReign\n\nCompared with the many questions on his origins, Kenneth's ascent to power and subsequent reign can be dealt with simply. Kenneth's rise can be placed in the context of the recent end of the previous dynasty, which had dominated  for two or four generations. This followed the death of king  son of  of , his brother ,  \"and others almost innumerable\" in battle against the Vikings in 839. The resulting succession crisis seems, if the Pictish Chronicle king-lists have any validity, to have resulted in at least four would-be kings warring for supreme power.\n\nKenneth's reign is dated from 843, but it was probably not until 848 that he defeated the last of his rivals for power. The Pictish Chronicle claims that he was king in  for two years before becoming Pictish king in 843, but this is not generally accepted. It is also said that his reign began in 834 and ended in 863, this is especially predominant in the 17th and 18th centuries where many depictions of Kenneth would state his reign as either 834-863 or 843-863. In 849, Kenneth had relics of Columba, which may have included the Monymusk Reliquary, transferred from Iona to Dunkeld. Other than these bare facts, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba reports that he invaded ' six times, captured Melrose and burnt Dunbar, and also that Vikings laid waste to Pictland, reaching far into the interior.Regarding , see Broun, \"Kenneth mac Alpin\"; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 111–112. The Annals of the Four Masters, not generally a good source on Scottish matters, do make mention of Kenneth, although what should be made of the report is unclear:, chief of , went to Alba, to strengthen the , at the request of Kenneth MacAlpin.Annals of the Four Master, for the year 835 (probably ). The history of  in this period is simply not known, or even if there was any sort of  to have a history. 's Vikings in Ireland and Scotland, available as etext, and Woolf, Kingdom of the Isles, may be helpful.\n\nThe reign of Kenneth also saw an increased degree of Norse settlement in the outlying areas of modern Scotland. Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, the Western Isles and the Isle of Man, and part of Ross were settled; the links between Kenneth's kingdom and Ireland were weakened, those with southern England and the continent almost broken. In the face of this, Kenneth and his successors were forced to consolidate their position in their kingdom, and the union between the Picts and the Gaels, already progressing for several centuries, began to strengthen.
