Both Digicel and Oceanic Digital were granted licences in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent Cable and Wireless monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used GSM wireless system, while Oceanic opted for the CDMA standard. Cable and Wireless, which had begun with TDMA standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM, and currently utilises both standards on its network.\n\nWith wireless usage increasing, landlines supplied by Cable and Wireless have declined from just over half a million to roughly about three hundred thousand as of 2006. In a bid to grab more market share, Cable and Wireless recently launched a new land line service called HomeFone Prepaid that would allow customers to pay for minutes they use rather than pay a set monthly fee for service, much like prepaid wireless service.\n\nTwo more licenses were auctioned by the Jamaican government to provide mobile services on the island, including one that was previously owned by AT&T Wireless but never utilized, and one new license.\n\nAnother entrant to the Jamaican communications market, FLOW, laid a new submarine cable connecting Jamaica to the United States. This new cable increases the total number of submarine cables connecting Jamaica to the rest of the world to four. The company's parent was acquired by Cable and Wireless Communications in November 2014 and finalized in March 2015. The new FLOW was re-launched as a successor to LIME and the old Flow on August 31, 2015; offering mobile, fixed voice, fixed broadband and TV services to the market. It has now become the first quad-play provider in Jamaica. The company runs a vast copper network (inherited from LIME) islandwide as well as a Hybrid Fiber and Coaxial network (from the old Flow) in the metropolitan areas of Kingston and Montego Bay. They also have small Fiber-to-the-home operations in certain sections of St. James that began in 2011 (under LIME). On the mobile side, the company had completed its 4G HSPA+ rollout (capable of speeds up to 21 Mbit/s) across the island in November 2015 and has announced plans to move to LTE within the year 2016. However, Digicel has become the first LTE network operator in Jamaica, going live with their network on June 9, 2016.[https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2016/06/13/digicel-jamaica-launches-lte/ Digicel Jamaica launches LTE]\n\nInternet\n\n* Internet top-level domain: .jm, registration of .jm domains is handled by MITS at the University of the West Indies, registration is free, although there has been some discussion about MITS making the service commercial in the coming years.\n* Internet users: 1.3 million users, 108th in the world; 46.5% of the population, 94th in the world (2012).Calculated using penetration rate and population data from [https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/rank.php \"Countries and Areas Ranked by Population: 2012\"], Population data, International Programs,  U.S. Census Bureau, retrieved 26 June 2013[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2013/Individuals_Internet_2000-2012.xls \"Percentage of Individuals using the Internet 2000-2012\"], International Telecommunications Union (Geneva), June 2013, retrieved 22 June 2013\n* Fixed broadband: 125,188 subscriptions, 96th in the world; 4.3% of population, 109th in the world (2012).[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ICTEYE/Reporting/DynamicReportWizard.aspx \"Fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants 2012\"], Dynamic Report, ITU ITC EYE, International Telecommunication Union.
