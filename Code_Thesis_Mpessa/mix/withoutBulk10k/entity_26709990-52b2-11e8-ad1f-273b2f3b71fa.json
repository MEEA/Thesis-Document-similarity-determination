  "textBody" : "Johann Baptist Homann (20 March 1664 – 1 July 1724) was a German geographer and cartographer, who also made maps of the Americas.\n\nLife \n\nHomann was born in Oberkammlach near Kammlach in the Electorate of Bavaria. Although educated at a Jesuit school, and preparing for an ecclesiastical career, he eventually converted to Protestantism and from 1687 worked as a civil law notary in Nuremberg. He soon turned to engraving and cartography; in 1702 he founded his own publishing house.\n\nHomann acquired renown as a leading German cartographer, and in 1715 was appointed Imperial Geographer by Emperor Charles VI. Giving such privileges to individuals was an added right that the Holy Roman Emperor enjoyed. In the same year he was also named a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Of particular significance to cartography were the imperial printing privileges (Latin: privilegia impressoria). These protected for a time the authors in all scientific fields such as printers, copper engravers, map makers and publishers. They were also very important as a recommendation for potential customers.\n\nIn 1716 Homann published his masterpiece Grosser Atlas ueber die ganze Welt (Grand Atlas of all the World). Numerous maps were drawn up in cooperation with the engraver Christoph Weigel the Elder, who also published Siebmachers Wappenbuch.\n\nHomann died in Nuremberg. He was succeeded by the Homann heirs company, which was in business until 1848. The company was known as \"Homann Erben\", \"Homanniani Heredes\", or \"Heritiers de Homann\" abroad.\n\nFile:Virginia Marylandia et Carolina by Johann Baptist Homann.jpg|Virginia Marylandia et Carolina, c. 1714\n\nFile:1730 Homann Map of Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Baltics - Geographicus - Scandinavia-homann-1730.jpg|Homann Map of Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Baltics, dated around 1715.\n\nImage:Homann - Planiglobii Terrestris Cumutroq Hemisphaerio Caelesti.png|Planiglobii Terrestris Cum Utroq[ue] Hemisphærio Cælesti Generalis Exhibitio, Nürnberg 1707\nFile:1725 Homann Map of the Caspian Sea and Kamchatka (as Yedso) - Geographicus - CaspianKamchatka-homann-1725.jpg|Homann Map of the Caspian Sea and Kamchatka, from 1725    \n\nFile:Homann Schlarraffenlandes 1694 Cornell CUL PJM 1015 01.jpg|Schlarraffenlandes, 1694.",
