  "textBody" : "Compactrons are a type of thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube, which contain arrangements of diodes, triodes, or pentodes in multiple combination arrays, as well as high or low-voltage and power types. The are, in effect, multiple tubes packed into a single body.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Compactron is a 12-pin Duodecar base vacuum tube family introduced in 1961 by General Electric in Owensboro, Kentucky  to compete with transistorized electronics during the solid state transition. Television sets were a primary application.\n\nUse was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric Porta-Color, was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons.\n\nCompactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what integrated circuits were to transistors). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos. They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche.\n\nNotable features \n\nA distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the evacuation tip on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with \"miniature\" tubes, and a characteristic 3/4\" diameter circle pin pattern.\n* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1\" to 2\" depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by Sylvania and by some Japanese firms.\n\nExamples \n\nExamples of Compactrons type types include:\n*6AG11 high-mu twin triode\n*6BK11 triple triode\n*6C10 high-mu triple triode by Sylvania, etc.... not related to the Edison Swan (later Mazda) 6C10 triode-hexode\n*6M11 twin triode - pentode\n*6K11 triple triode\n*6LF6 beam power tetrode with anode cap\n*8B10 twin triode - twin diode\n*12AE10 twin pentode\n*38HK7 pentode diode\n\nDue to their specific applications in television circuits, many different Compactron types were produced. Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.\n\nTechnological obsolescence \n\nIntegrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. \"Hybrid\" television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986.
