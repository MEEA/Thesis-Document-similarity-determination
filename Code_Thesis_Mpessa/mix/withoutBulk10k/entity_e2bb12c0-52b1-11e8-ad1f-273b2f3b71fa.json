  "textBody" : "Canadian Unitarian Council () (CUC) formed on May 14, 1961 to be the national organization for Canadians who belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) (the UUA formed a day later, on May 15, 1961). Until 2002, almost all member congregations of the CUC were also members of the UUA, and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, after an agreement between the CUC and the UUA, most services since 2002 have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations, with the UUA continuing to provide ministerial settlement services. Some Canadian congregations have continued to be members of both the CUC and UUA, while others are members of only the CUC.\n\nThe CUC is currently the only national body for Unitarian Universalist congregations in Canada, and is a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe CUC is made up of 46 member congregations and emerging groups, who are the legal owners of the organization, and who are, for governance and service delivery, divided into four regions: \"BC\" (British Columbia), \"Western\" (Alberta to Thunder Bay), \"Central\" (between Thunder Bay and Kingston), and \"Eastern\" (Kingston, Ottawa and everything east of that).[http://cuc.ca/archive/programs/regions.htm Regions of the CUC]  However, for youth ministry, the \"Central\" and \"Eastern\" regions are combined to form a youth region known as \"QuOM\" (Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes), giving the youth only three regions for their activities.[http://cuc.ca/archive/youth/regions.htm Regions and Congregations]  The organization as a whole is governed by the CUC Board of Trusties (Board), whose mandate it is to govern in the best interests of the CUC's owners. The Board is made up of 8 members who are elected by congregational delegates at the CUC's Annual General Meeting. This consists of two Trustees from each region, who are eligible to serve a maximum of two three-year terms. Board meetings also include Official Observers to the Board, who participate without a vote and represent UU Youth and Ministers.\n\nService delivery\n\nAs members of the CUC, congregations and emerging groups are served by volunteer Service Consultants, Congregational Networks, and a series of other committees. There are two directors of regional services, one for the Western two regions, and one for the Eastern two regions. The Director of Lifespan Learning oversees development of religious exploration programming and youth and young adults are served by a Youth and Young Adult Ministry Development staff person.\n\nAnnual Conference and Meeting\n\nPolicies and business of the CUC are determined at the Annual Conference and Meeting (ACM), consisting of the Annual Conference, in which workshops are held, and the Annual General Meeting, in which business matters and plenary meetings are performed. The ACM features two addresses, a Keynote and a Confluence Lecture. The Confluence Lecture is comparable to the UUA's Ware Lecture in prestige. In early days this event simply consisted of the Annual General Meeting component as the Annual Conference component was not added to much later. And starting in 2017 the conference portion will only tack place every second year. Past ACMs have been held in the following locations:\n\n^Not an ACM, but an \"Annual General Meeting\" and \"Symposium\", and unlike ACMs it was organized by the CUC and the Unitarian Universalist Ministers of Canada instead of a local congregation.#Not a keynote presenter or lecturer, rather a symposium \"Provocateur\".*Upcoming locations\n\nPrinciples and sources\n\nThe CUC does not have a central creed in which members are required to believe, but they have found it useful to articulate their common values in what has become known as The Principles and Sources of our Religious Faith, which are currently based on the UUA's [http://www.uua.org/beliefs/principles/ Principles and Purposes]. The CUC had a [http://www.cuc.ca/statement/ task force] whose mandate was to consider revising them.[http://cuc.ca/principles-and-sources/ Principles and Sources]\n\nThe principles and sources as published in church literature and [http://cuc.ca/principles-and-sources/ on the CUC website]:\n\nThe Principles and Sources of our Religious Faith\n\nPrinciples\n\nWe, the member congregations of the Canadian Unitarian Council, covenant to affirm and promote:\n\n:*The inherent worth and dignity of every person;\n:*Justice, equity, and compassion in human relations;\n:*Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;\n:*A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;\n:*The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;\n:*The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;\n:*Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.\n\nSources\n\nThe living tradition which we share draws from many sources:\n\n:*Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;\n:*Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;\n:*Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;\n:*Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbours as ourselves;\n:*Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit;\n:*Spiritual teachings of Earth-centred traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.\n\nGrateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision. As free congregations we enter into this covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support.\n\nFormation and relationship to the Unitarian Universalist Association\n\nThe CUC formed on May 14, 1961 to be the national organization for Canadians within the about to form, UUA (they formed a day later on May 15, 1961). And until 2002, almost all member congregations of the CUC were also members of the UUA and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA.

And also since 2002, some Canadian congregations have continued to be members of both the UUA and CUC while others are members of only the CUC.\n\nThe Canadian Unitarian Universalist youth of the day disapproved of the 2002 change in relationship between the CUC and UUA. It is quite evident in the words of this statement, which was adopted by the attendees of the 2001 youth conference held at the Unitarian Church of Montreal: \"We the youth of Canada are deeply concerned about the direction the CUC seems to be taking. As stewards of our faith, adults have a responsibility to take into consideration the concerns of youth.
