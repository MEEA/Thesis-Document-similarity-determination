Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility.\nIn an integral domain, every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if , an equality  implies .\n\n\"Integral domain\" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation. This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity.B.L. van der Waerden, Algebra Erster Teil, p. 36, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg 1966.I.N. Herstein, Topics in Algebra, p. 88-90, Blaisdell Publishing Company, London 1964. Noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted.J.C. McConnel and J.C. Robson \"Noncommutative Noetherian Rings\" (Graduate Studies in Mathematics Vol. 30, AMS)  This article, however, follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term \"integral domain\" for the commutative case and using \"domain\" for the general case including noncommutative rings.\n\nSome sources, notably Lang, use the term entire ring for integral domain.Pages 91–92 of \n\nSome specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions:\n\nDefinition \n\nAn integral domain is basically defined as a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.\nThis definition may be reformulated in a number of equivalent definitions :\n* An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors.\n* An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal.\n* An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring for which every non-zero element is cancellable under multiplication.\n* An integral domain is a ring for which the set of nonzero elements is a commutative monoid under multiplication (because a monoid must be  closed under multiplication).\n* An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which for every nonzero element r, the function that maps each element x of the ring to the product xr is injective. Elements r with this property are called regular, so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.\n\nA fundamental property of integral domains is that every subring of a field is an integral domain, and that, conversely, given any integral domain, one may construct a field that contains it as a subring, the field of fractions. This characterization may be viewed as a further equivalent definition:\n* An integral domain is a ring that is (isomorphic to) a subring of a field.\n\nExamples \n\n* The archetypical example is the ring \\Z of all integers.\n* Every field is an integral domain. For example, the field \\R of all real numbers is an integral domain.  Conversely, every Artinian integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are finite fields (more generally, by Wedderburn's little theorem, finite domains are finite fields). The ring of integers \\Z provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:\n\n:\\Z \\supset 2\\Z \\supset \\cdots \\supset 2^n\\Z \\supset 2^{n+1}\\Z \\supset \\cdots\n\n* Rings of polynomials are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring \\Z[x] of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring \\C[x_1,\\ldots,x_n] of all polynomials in n-variables with complex coefficients.\n\n* The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring \\C[x,y]/(y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2))corresponding to a plane elliptic curve is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2)is an irreducible polynomial.\n\n* The ring \\Z[x]/(x^2 - n) \\cong \\Z[\\sqrt{n}] is an integral domain for any non-square integer n. If n > 0, then this ring is always a subring of \\R, otherwise, it is a subring of \\C.\n\n* The ring of p-adic integers \\Z_p is an integral domain.\n\n* If U is a connected open subset of the complex plane \\C, then the ring \\mathcal{H}(U) consisting of all holomorphic functions is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of analytic functions on connected open subsets of analytic manifolds.\n\n* A regular local ring is an integral domain. In fact, a regular local ring is a UFD.\n\nNon-examples \n\nThe following rings are not integral domains.\n\n* The zero ring (the ring in which 0=1).\n\n* The quotient ring \\Z/m\\Z when m is a composite number. Indeed, choose a proper factorization m = xy (meaning that x and y are not equal to 1 or m). Then x \\not\\equiv 0 \\bmod{m} and y \\not\\equiv 0 \\bmod{m}, but xy \\equiv 0 \\bmod{m}.\n\n* If R and S are commutative rings, then the product ring R \\times S is never an integral domain, because (1, 0) \\cdot (0, 1) = (0, 0) is the zero element.\n\n* When n is a square, the ring \\Z[x]/(x^2 - n) is not an integral domain. Write n m^2, and note that there is a factorization x^2 - n \n (x - m)(x + m) in \\Z[x]. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there is an isomorphism \\Z[x]/(x^2 - n) \\cong \\Z[x]/(x - m) \\times \\Z[x]/(x + m) \\cong \\Z \\times \\Z.\n\n* The ring of n × n matrices over any nonzero ring when n ≥ 2. If M and N are matrices such that the image of N is contained in the kernel of M, then MN 0.  For example, this happens for M \n N = (\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}).\n\n* A geometric non-example is the quotient ring k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(fg) for any field k, since (fg) is not a prime ideal. This is geometric because the underlying topological space of the affine scheme \\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]/(fg) is reducible, since it is the union of the closed subsets \\{f 0\\} and \\{g \n 0\\}.\n\n* The ring of continuous functions on the unit interval.  Consider the functions\n: f(x) \\begin{cases} 1-2x & x \\in \\left [0, \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right ] \\\\ 0 & x \\in \\left [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1 \\right ] \\end{cases} \\qquad g(x) \n \\begin{cases} 0 & x \\in \\left [0, \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right ] \\\\ 2x-1 & x \\in \\left [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1 \\right ] \\end{cases}\nNeither f nor g is everywhere zero, but fg is.\n\n* The tensor product \\C \\otimes_{\\R} \\C. This ring has two non-trivial idempotents, e_1 \\tfrac{1}{2}(1 \\otimes 1) - \\tfrac{1}{2}(i \\otimes i) and e_2 \n \\tfrac{1}{2}(1 \\otimes 1) + \\tfrac{1}{2}(i \\otimes i). They are orthogonal, meaning that e_1e_2 = 0, and hence \\C \\otimes_{\\R} \\C is not a domain. In fact, there is an isomorphism \\C \\times \\C \\to \\C \\otimes_{\\R} \\C defined by (z, w) \\mapsto z \\cdot e_1 + w \\cdot e_2. Its inverse is defined by z \\otimes w \\mapsto (zw, z\\overline{w}). This example shows that a fiber product of irreducible affine schemes need not be irreducible.\n\nDivisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements \n\nIn this section, R is an integral domain.\n\nGiven elements a and b of R, we say that a divides b, or that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, if there exists an element x in R such that ax = b.\n\nThe elements that divide 1 are called the units of R; these are precisely the invertible elements in R. Units divide all other elements.\n\nIf a divides b and b divides a, then we say a and b are associated elements or associates.  Equivalently, a and b are associates if a = ub for some unit u.\n\nIf q is a nonzero non-unit, we say that q is an irreducible element if q cannot be written as a product of two non-units.\n\nIf p is a nonzero non-unit, we say that p is a prime element if, whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Equivalently, an element p is prime if and only if the principal ideal (p) is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of prime element generalizes the ordinary definition of prime number in the ring \\Z, except that it allows for negative prime elements.\n\nEvery prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the quadratic integer ring \\Z\\left[\\sqrt{-5}\\right] the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since a^2+5b^2=3 has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides \\left(2 + \\sqrt{-5}\\right)\\left(2 - \\sqrt{-5}\\right) without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a GCD domain), an irreducible element is a prime element.\n\nWhile unique factorization does not hold in \\Z\\left[\\sqrt{-5}\\right], there is unique factorization of ideals.  See Lasker–Noether theorem.\n\nProperties \n\n* A commutative ring R is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of R is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If R is graded, then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.\n* If R is a commutative ring and P is an ideal in R, then the quotient ring R/P is an integral domain if and only if P is a prime ideal.\n* Let R be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain S such that R ⊂ S and S has an element which is transcendental over R.\n* The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any a, b, and c in an integral domain, if a ≠ 0 and ab ac then b \n c. Another way to state this is that the function x  ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain.\n* The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if xI xJ, then either x is zero or I \n J.\n* An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals.\n* An inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain.\n\nField of fractions \n\nThe field of fractions K of an integral domain R is the set of fractions a/b with a and b in R and b ≠ 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations.  It is \"the smallest field containing R \" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism  such that any injective ring homomorphism from R to a field factors through K. The field of fractions of the ring of integers \\Z is the field of rational numbers \\Q. The field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself.\n\nAlgebraic geometry \n\nIntegral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced (that is x2 0 implies x \n 0) and irreducible (that is there is only one minimal prime ideal). The former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.\n\nThis translates, in algebraic geometry, into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety.\n\nMore generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme.\n\nCharacteristic and homomorphisms \n\nThe characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime number.\n\nIf R is an integral domain of prime characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(x) = xp is injective.",
