He was a son of Chinu no ōkimi (Prince Chinu, 茅渟王) by Kibitsuhime no ōkimi (Princess Kibitsuhime, 吉備姫王). Empress Kōgyoku was his elder sister from the same parents. Chinu was a son of Prince Oshisaka hikohito no ōe, whose father was the Emperor Bidatsu. He had at least three consorts including his Empress, Hashihito no Himemiko (Princess Hashihito), the daughter of Emperor Jomei and his sister Empress Kōgyoku.\n\nHe ruled from July 12, 645,July 12 645 corresponds to the Fourteenth Day of the Sixth Month of 645 (isshi). until his death in 654.\n\nIn 645 he ascended to the throne two days after Prince Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji) assassinated Soga no Iruka in the court of Kōgyoku. Kōgyoku abdicated in favor of her son and crown prince, Naka no Ōe, but Naka no Ōe insisted Kōtoku should ascend to the throne instead.\n\n* 645:  In the 3rd year of Kōgyoku-tennō 's reign (皇極天皇三年), the empress abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by her younger brother.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōtoku is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, pp. 47–48; Brown, p. 266; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.\n\nKōtoku's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably Sumeramikoto or Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi (治天下大王), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\".  Alternatively, Kōtoku might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\n\nAccording to the Nihonshoki, he was of gentle personality and was in favor of Buddhism.\n\nIn 645 he created a new city in the area called Naniwa, and moved the capital from Yamato Province to this new city (see Nara). The new capital had a sea port and was good for foreign trade and diplomatic activities.\n\nIn 653 Kōtoku sent an embassy to the court of the Tang dynasty in China, but some of the ships were lost en route.\n\nNaka no Ōe held the rank of crown prince and was the de facto leader of the government. In 653 Naka no Ōe proposed to move the capital again to Yamato province. Kōtoku denied. Naka no Ōe ignored the emperor's policy and moved to the former province. Many courtiers of the court including, Empress Hashihito, followed him. Kōtoku was left in the palace. In the next year he died because of illness. After his death, Naka no Ōe would not ascend to the throne.  Instead, his mother and the sister of Kōtoku, the former Empress Kogyoku ascended to the throne under another name, Empress Saimei.\n\nThe system of hasshō kyakkan (eight ministries and a hundred offices) was first established during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.Varley, p. 133.\n\nThe actual site of Kōtoku's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Osaka.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōtoku's mausoleum.
