BitchX is a popular one.\") and has been considered to be the most popular ircII-based IRC client. The initial implementation, written by \"Trench\" and \"HappyCrappy\", was a script for the IrcII chat client. It was converted to a program in its own right by panasync (Colten Edwards). BitchX 1.1 final was released in 2004. It is written in C and is a TUI application utilizing ncurses. GTK+ toolkit support has been dropped. It works on all Unix-like operating systems, and is distributed under a BSD license. It is originally based on ircII-EPIC and eventually it was merged into the EPIC IRC client. It supports IPv6, multiple servers and SSL and a subset of UTF-8 (characters contained in ISO-8859-1) with an unofficial patch.\n\nBitchX has frequently been noted to be a popular IRC client for Unix-like systems.[http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/bitchx.html Review:BitchX (Amiga)], IRCreviews.org, Retrieved 2009-09-29 (\"BitchX is favoured by many more experienced IRC users\")[http://www.osdir.com/Article4735.phtml A Day in the Life of #Apache], OSDir.com (March 25, 2005), Retrieved 2009-09-29 (\"XChat, mIRC, and bitchx are several popular clients\")[http://www.overclockersclub.com/guides/ircguide/ How to use IRC guide], Overclockersclub.com (Dec. 4, 2006), Retrieved 2009-09-29 (\"There are many different clients available, some of the more popular ones include BitchX, XChat, Trillian, BeserIRC, Klient ....\")[http://www.broadbandreports.com/faq/5165 What about P2P on *nix?], Broadbandreports.com (Sept. 13, 2002), Retrieved 2009-09-29 (\"There are several IRC clients for Linux.
