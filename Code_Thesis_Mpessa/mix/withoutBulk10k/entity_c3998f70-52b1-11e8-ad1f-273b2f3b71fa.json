  "textBody" : "Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation, a congenital disorder, where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment.\n\nIn the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US.\n\nTypes\n\nLeg\n\nLower limb, or leg, amputations can be divided into two broad categories - minor amputations and major amputations, Minor amputations generally refers to the amputation of digits. Major amputations are commonly referred to as below-knee amputation, above-knee amputation and so forth. To avoid ambiguity the correct terminology for major amputations is described in ISO 8549-2:1989, these being:\n* partial foot amputation  - amputation of the lower limb distal to the ankle joint.   \n* ankle disarticulation - amputation of the lower limb at the ankle joint.\n* trans-tibial amputation - amputation of the lower limb between the knee joint and the ankle joint, commonly referred to as a below-knee amputation.\n* knee disarticulation - amputation of the lower limb at the knee joint.\n* trans-femoral amputation - amputation of the lower limb between the hip joint and the knee joint, commonly referred to an above-knee amputation.\n* hip disarticulation - amputation of the lower limb at the hip joint.\n* trans-pelvic disarticulation- amputation of the whole lower limb together with all or part of the pelvis.This  is also known as a hemipelvectomy or hindquarter amputation.\nCommon partial foot amputations include Chopart, Lisfranc and ray amputations, Common forms of ankle disarticulations include Syme, Pyrogoff and Boyd. A less commonly occurring major amputation is the Van Ness rotation/rotationplasty (foot being turned around and reattached to allow the ankle joint to be used as a knee).\n\nArm\n\nThe correct terminology for arm, or upper-limb amputations is also described in  ISO 8549-2:1989, these being:\n* partial hand amputation\n* wrist disarticulation\n* trans-radial amputation, commonly referred to as below-elbow or forearm amputation\n* elbow disarticulation\n* trans-humeral amputation, commonly referred to as above-elbow amputation\n* shoulder disarticulation \n* forequarter amputation\nA variant of the trans-radial amputation is the Krukenberg procedure in which the radius and ulna are used to create a stump capable of a pincer action.\n\nOther\n\n* Face:\n** amputation of the ears\n** amputation of the nose (rhinotomy)\n** amputation of the tongue (glossectomy).\n** amputation of the eyes (enucleation). Many of these facial disfigurings were and still are done in some parts of the world as punishment for some crimes, and as individual shame and population terror practices.\n** amputation of the teeth.  Removal of teeth, mainly incisors, is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes (for instance in the Iberomaurusian culture of Neolithic North Africa).\n* Breasts:\n** amputation of the breasts (mastectomy).\n* Genitals:\n** amputation of the testicles (castration).\n** amputation of the penis (penectomy).\n** amputation of the foreskin (circumcision).\n** amputation of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).\n\nHemicorporectomy, or amputation at the waist, and decapitation, or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.\n\nGenital modification and mutilation may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.\n\nSelf-amputation\n\nIn some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb.\n\nBody integrity identity disorder is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb.  In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.\n\nCauses\n\nCirculatory disorders\n\n* Diabetic foot infection or gangrene (the most frequent reason for infection-related amputations)\n* Sepsis with peripheral necrosis\n\nNeoplasm\n\n* Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors (e.g. osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, liposarcoma)\n* Melanoma\n\nTrauma\n\n* Severe limb injuries in which the limb cannot be saved or efforts to save the limb fail.\n* Traumatic amputation (an unexpected amputation that occurs at the scene of an accident, where the limb is partially or entirely severed as a direct result of the accident, for example, a finger that is severed from the blade of a table saw)\n* Amputation in utero (Amniotic band)\n\nDeformities\n\n* Deformities of digits and/or limbs (e.g., proximal femoral focal deficiency, Fibular hemimelia)\n* Extra digits and/or limbs (e.g., polydactyly)\n\nInfection\n\n* Bone infection (osteomyelitis)\n* Diabetes https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/diabetes-amputation#overview1\n* Frostbite https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/basics/treatment/con-20034608\n\nAthletic performance\n\n* Sometimes professional athletes may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. Australian Rules footballer Daniel Chick elected to have his left ring finger amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed]  Rugby union player Jone Tawake also had a finger removed. National Football League safety Ronnie Lott had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the 1985 NFL season.\n\nLegal punishment \n\n* Amputation is used as a legal punishment in a number of countries, among them Saudi Arabia, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Sudan, and Islamic regions of Nigeria.\n\nSurgery \n\nMethod\n\nThe first step is ligating the supplying artery and vein, to prevent hemorrhage (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally, the bone is sawed through with an oscillating saw. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a prosthesis.\n\nDistal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periostium. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.\n\nPost-operative management \n\nThe use of rigid removable dressings (RRD's) in trans-tibial (below knee) amputations, rather than soft bandaging has been shown to improve healing time, reduce edema, prevent knee flexion contractures and reduce complications, including further amputation, from external trauma such as falls onto the stump and should be considered standard practice.\n\nPost-operative management, in addition to wound healing, should consider maintenance of limb strength, joint range, edema management, preservation of the intact limb (if applicable) and stump desensitisation.\n\nTrauma \n\nTraumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment: \"Amputations\", editions Lange, USA, 2009Harry Gouvas: \"Accidents and Massive Disasters\", editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000Neil Watson: \"Hand Injuries and Infections\" Cower Medical Publishing, London, New York, 1996, \n\nTraumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.Harry Gouvas: \"Accidents and massive Disasters\", Editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000\n\nOrthopedic surgeons often assess the severity of different injuries using the Mangled Extremity Severity Score. Given different clinical and situational factors, they can predict the likelihood of amputation. This is especially useful for emergency physicians to quickly evaluate patients and decide on consultations.\n\nCauses\n\nTraumatic amputation is uncommon in humans (1 per 20,804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but sometimes a few days later after medical complications. Statistically the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:\n* Traffic accidents (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, etc.)\n* Labor accidents (equipment, instruments, cylinders, chainsaws, press machines, meat machines, wood machines, etc.)\n* Agricultural accidents, with machines and mower equipment\n* Electric shock hazards\n* Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives\n* Violent rupture of ship rope or industry wire rope\n* Ring traction (ring amputation, de-gloving injuries)\n* Building doors and car doors\n* Gas cylinder explosions\n* Other rare accidents\n\nTreatment\n\nThe development of the science of microsurgery over last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:\n* 1st choice: Surgical amputation - break - prosthesis\n* 2nd choice: Surgical amputation - transplantation of other tissue - plastic reconstruction.\n* 3rd choice: Replantation - reconnection - revascularisation of amputated limb, by microscope (after 1969)\n* 4th choice: Transplantation of cadaveric hand (after 2000),Neil Watson: \"Hand Injuries and Infections\"Cower Medical Publishing,\n\nEpidemiology\n\n* In the United States in 1999, there were 14,420 non-fatal traumatic amputations according to the American Statistical Association. Of these, 4,435 occurred as a result of traffic and transportation accidents and 9,985 were due to labor accidents. Of all traumatic amputations, the distribution percentage is 30.75% for traffic accidents and 69.24% for labor accidents.[http://www.amstat.org/ American Statistical Association: Amputations in USA, 2000]\n* The population of the United States in 1999 was about 300,000,000, so the conclusion is that there is one amputation per 20,804 persons per year. In the group of labor amputations, 53% occurred in laborers and technicians, 30% in production and service workers, 16% in silviculture and fishery workers.\n* A study found that in 2010, 22.8% of patients undergoing amputation of a lower extremity in the United States were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Steiner C. Readmissions to U.S. Hospitals by Procedure, 2010. HCUP Statistical Brief #154. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. April 2013. [http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb154.jsp]\n\nPrevention\n\nAmputations are usually traumatic experiences. They can reduce the quality of life for patients in addition to being expensive. In the USA, a typical prosthetic limb costs in the range of $10,000–15,000 according to the American Diabetic Association. In some populations, preventing amputations is a critical task.\n\nMethods in preventing amputation, limb-sparing techniques, depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or decubitus ulcers in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.\n\nThere are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).\n \nCrush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.\n\nA study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis. Another study found it also effective for healing limb ulcers caused by peripheral vascular disease. The boot checks the heart rhythm and compresses the limb between heartbeats; the compression helps cure the wounds in the walls of veins and arteries, and helps to push the blood back to the heart.[http://podcasts.mayoclinic.org/2008/07/11/circulator-boot/ Circulator Boot at Mayo Clinic] 1:08–1:32\n\nFor victims of trauma, advances in microsurgery in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.\n\nThe establishment of laws, rules, and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.\n\nA large proportion of amputees (50–80%) experience the phenomenon of phantom limbs; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome).\n\nA similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (Phantoms in the Brain: V.S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head.\n\nIn many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience proprioception of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of stump socks may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.\n\nAnother side effect can be heterotopic ossification, especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by improvised explosive devices in the Iraq War.\n\nDue to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the Challenged Athletes Foundation have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and adaptive sports such as Amputee Soccer.\n\nHistory\n\nThe word amputation is derived from the Latin amputare, \"to cut away\", from ambi- (\"about\", \"around\") and putare (\"to prune\"). The English word \"amputation\" was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words \"extirpation\" (16th-century French texts tended to use extirper), \"disarticulation\", and \"dismemberment\" (from the Old French desmembrer and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply \"cutting\", but by the end of the 17th century \"amputation\" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.\n\nNotable cases\n\n* Terry Fox\n* Bethany Hamilton\n* Oscar Pistorius\n* Frida Kahlo\n* Amy Purdy\n* Pete Gray\n* Aimee Mullins\n* Aron Ralston\n* Hugh Herr\n* Robert David Hall\n* Douglas Bader",

The English word \"amputation\" was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words \"extirpation\" (16th-century French texts tended to use extirper), \"disarticulation\", and \"dismemberment\" (from the Old French desmembrer and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply \"cutting\", but by the end of the 17th century \"amputation\" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.\n\nNotable cases\n\n* Terry Fox\n* Bethany Hamilton\n* Oscar Pistorius\n* Frida Kahlo\n* Amy Purdy\n* Pete Gray\n* Aimee Mullins\n* Aron Ralston\n* Hugh Herr\n* Robert David Hall\n* Douglas Bader.
