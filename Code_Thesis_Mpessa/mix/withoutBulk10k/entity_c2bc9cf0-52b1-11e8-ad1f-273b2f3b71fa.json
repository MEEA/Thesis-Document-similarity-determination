  "textBody" : "Andrzej Sapkowski (; born 21 June 1948) is a Polish fantasy writer. He is best known for his book series, The Witcher. His books have been translated so far into nineteen languages.\n\nBiography\n\nSapkowski studied economics at the University of Łódź, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first short story, \"The Witcher\" (\"Wiedźmin\", also translated \"The Hexer\" or \"Spellmaker\") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine Fantastyka. In an interview he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm НО МЫ ЖЕ СЛАВЯНЕ! РАЗГОВОР С АНДЖЕЕМ САПКОВСКИМ], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine \"World of Fatnastics\" The story was published in Fantastyka in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of \"The Witcher\", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.\n\nThe main character of \"The Witcher\" is Geralt, a mutant hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe.

Sapkowski has won five Zajdel Awards, including three for short stories \"Mniejsze zło\" (\"Lesser Evil\") (1990), \"Miecz przeznaczenia\" (\"Sword of Destiny\") (1992) and \"W leju po bombie\" (\"In a Bomb Crater\") (1993), and two for the novels, Krew elfów (Blood of Elves) (1994) and Narrenturm (2002).
