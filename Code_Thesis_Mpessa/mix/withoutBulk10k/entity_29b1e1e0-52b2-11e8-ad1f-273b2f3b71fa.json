  "textBody" : "Kajang () is a mukim, a state constituency and the largest town of Hulu Langat District, Selangor, Malaysia.\n\nThe current locational gravity of growth in Kajang would be Sungai Chua. The total population of Kajang has grown rapidly in the past few years, with estimated population growth of 9% per annum. The soon-to-be-realised Klang Valley MRT station in Bandar Kajang will boost the property value in Sungai Chua.\n\nAs of 2004, a few townships have been developed in Kajang, such as Taman Prima Saujana , Sungai Chua, Taman Kajang Perdana (Kajang Highlands). Lately, many high-end developments has mushroomed in Kajang such as Twin Palms, Sri Banyan, Country Heights, Jade Hills, TTDI Groove, Tropicana Heights and Prima Paramount.\n\nAreas surrounding these new townships are easily accessible via the SILK Expressway. Kajang is governed by the Majlis Perbandaran Kajang.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe origin of the name Kajang\n\nThere are several opinions on the origin of the name of Kajang:\n\nFirst opinion: Kajang believed to be originally explored by the indigenous people of the Temuan tribe since 1580. This tribe named Kajang based on a type of screw pines that is used to make roof that grows abundantly in the area.\n\nThe second opinion: In conjunction with the shape of the nailed roof. A member of Ujong River named Batin Berenggai Besi, has set up several huts on the riverside located in the current Kajang area by using a type of screw pines for building the cascading (Kajang) nailed roof. Then, he concludes this place is suitable for settlement.\n\nThird Opinion: According to a story, the meaning of the word 'Kajang' in Mendailingese is 'housed/sheltered'. Meanwhile, in Buginese is 'battle or quarrel'. Both of these factions have once clashed in one of the hill areas facing the current railway station because of the misunderstanding of the word 'Kajang'. This incident occurred when both groups fled to the Langat River for fleeing from the civil war in Klang between 1867 and 1873. After the incident, the place was named Kajang.\n\nFourth opinion: In another source said Kajang was opened by Mr. Lili also known as Toh Lili who came from Riau in 1776. He is the follower of Sultan Mohamed Shah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Ibrahim Shah from Riau. With the Sultan's permission, he and his six friends have opened the land for paddy cultivation at Bukit Sungai Merbau and opened the Merbau River mine where now known as Kajang.\n\nThe fifth opinion: Raja Alang from the Mandailing tribe with a group of followers migrated to Malaya in the early 1800s. The group sailed into Malaya through Kuala Sungai Langat. After several days sailing, they shelter or 'berkajang' in an area now called Mandailing Road. Some of the followers of the Raja Alam have explored the area of Kampung Batu 14 now with rice cultivation. Their placement was finally inaugurated by the name of Kajang by Raja Alam.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first settlement in Kajang was established in 1709. In 1807, Kajang was founded after the Klang War. Because of its central location, it was made the district capital of Hulu Langat.\n\nKajang as a modern town owes its rise in particular to the coffee estates which were opened up around it in the 1890s. One of the famous coffee estates were Inch Kenneth Estate managed by the Kindersley brothers who were among the first to plant rubber in the country on a commercial basis. Another was Perang Besar (Great War) Estate, opened by some British ex-servicemen led by Colonel Henry Gough, who was the pioneer of bud-grafting of rubber trees in the country.\n\nDemographics \n\nKajang's population of 342,657 is 60.4% Malay, 19.3% Chinese, 9.7% Indians, and 10.6% other ethnic groups.\n\nKajang's main population centres are Taman Saujana Impian, Sg.

Sekamat, Bandar Mahkota, Jalan Reko, Jalan Bukit, Taman Prima Saujana, Taman Kantan Permai, Taman Kajang Perdana, Taman Sri Ramal, Taman Kajang Prima,Bandar Teknologi Kajang,Semenyih Town and Berenang.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe centre of Kajang is the bustling Old Town, where all the roads meet. Most of the colonial-era buildings were constructed around the 1920s to 1930s.  The architecture of these shophouses is a combination of traditional Chinese and European designs. The ground floor was used mostly for commercial activities and the upper floor as the family living quarter.\n\nOne of Kajang's landmarks is Stadium Kajang which is situated in the heart of the town. The stadium can accommodate up to 5,000 people and is used throughout the year for the community soccer competitions.\n\nAnother landmark is the Kajang Mosque Jamek, which is easily recognisable by its bright yellow facade.\n\nThe upcoming MRT ( Mass Rapid Transport ) run across Kajang Town all the way from Sungai Buloh and Kuala Lumpur is another distinctive landmark visible for directions. KK Hotel Kajang( 65 rooms) is Situated in between the Station Kajang Town and Station Saujana Impian.\n\nTransportation\n\nCar\n\nKajang is well-served by a network of tolled expressways and federal highways.\n\nHighway , the premier northâ€“south federal highway of Peninsular Malaysia, runs through downtown Kajang and then southwards until Johor Bahru.\nA stretch of highway  is concurrent with the Grand Saga Highway  between Cheras Sentral and Taman Koperasi CUEPACS.\nThe SILK Expressway  starts in Seri Kembangan, which then runs through Balakong and then forms a beltway around downtown Kajang before ending near Bangi. It is hence regarded as the main ring road for Kajang. PLUS Expressway  exit 210 serves the vicinity of Kajang and Bangi.\nFrom Ampang, one can reach Kajang with state routes  and then .\n\nPublic transport\n\nKajang KTM/MRT (code: ) is the principal rail station serving Kajang. It is an interchange station between the SBK MRT Line and the KTM network. KTM Intercity, Komuter and ETS services are available.
