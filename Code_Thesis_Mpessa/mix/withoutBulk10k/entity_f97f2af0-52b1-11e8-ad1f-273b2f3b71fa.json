The work has been published in English as Courtly Dance of the Renaissance by Julia Sutton.\n\nBoth manuals have been printed in facsimile edition.  Many of the dances of Fabritio Caroso's manuals are meant for two dancers with a few for four or more dancers.  These manuals offer a great deal of information to dance historians and musicologists alike in that each description of a dance is accompanied by music examples with lute tablature and directions about how each music example is to be played.  Many of the dances also contain dedications to noble women of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.\n\nBibliography\n\n* Caroso, Fabritio.
