  "textBody" : "The Apostles' Creed (Latin: Symbolum Apostolorum or Symbolum Apostolicum), sometimes entitled Symbol of the Apostles, is an early statement of Christian belief—a creed or \"symbol\". It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the Catholic Church, Lutheranism and Anglicanism. It is also used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists.\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is Trinitarian in structure with sections affirming belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ His Son and the Holy Spirit. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the Canonical gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the Old Roman Symbol. Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some Christological issues defined in the Nicene and other Christian Creeds. It thus says nothing explicitly about the divinity of either Jesus or the Holy Spirit. This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD 390 from a synod in Milan and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the Twelve Apostles contributed an article of a creed..\n\nOrigin\n\nThe title Symbolum Apostolicum (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by Ambrose, from a Council in Milan to Pope Siricius in about AD 390 \"Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled\".. But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase \"maker of heaven and earth\", a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century..\n\nThe account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed,. as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.\n\nThe earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on , part of the Great Commission, and it has been argued that it was already in written form by the late 2nd century (c. 180)...\n\nWhile the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the Old Roman Symbol – are found in various writings by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Novatian, Marcellus, Rufinus, Ambrose, Augustine, Nicetas, and Eusebius Gallus, the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus (\"Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books\") of St. Pirminius (Migne, Patrologia Latina 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714.. Bettenson and Maunder state that it is first from Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus (idem quod excarpsus, excerpt), c. 750.. This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain. Charlemagne imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the Old Roman Symbol or similar formulas had survived for centuries. It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier..\n\nSome have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.. For instance, the phrase \"descendit ad inferos\" (\"he descended into hell\") echoes , \"κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς\" (\"he descended into the lower earthly regions\"). It is of interest that this phrase first appeared in one of the two versions of Rufinus in AD 390 and then did not appear again in any version of the creed until AD 650..\n\nThis phrase and that on the communion of saints are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the Old Roman Symbol nor in the Nicene Creed.\n\nMusical settings\n\nMusical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a motet are rare. The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, the Spanish composer Fernando de las Infantas published two in 1578.\n\nMore recently, in 1979 John Michael Talbot, a Third Order Franciscan, composed and recorded \"Creed\" on his album, The Lord's Supper.. In 1986 Graham Kendrick published the popular \"We believe in God the Father\", closely based on the Apostles' Creed. Rich Mullins and Beaker also composed a musical setting titled \"Creed\", released on Mullins' 1993 album A Liturgy, a Legacy, & a Ragamuffin Band. The song \"Creed\" on Petra's 1990 album Beyond Belief is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.\n\nGIA Publications published a hymn text in 1991 directly based on the Apostles' Creed, called \"I Believe in God Almighty.\" It has been sung to hymn tunes from Wales, the Netherlands, and Ireland..\n\nIn 2014 Hillsong released a version of the Apostles' Creed under the title \"This I Believe (The Creed)\" on their album No Other Name. Keith Getty and Kristyn Getty released an expression of the Apostles' Creed under the title \"We Believe (Apostle's Creed)\" on their 2016 album Facing a Task Unfinished.\n\nText in Latin\n\nCredo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae,\n  et in Iesum Christum, Filium Eius unicum, Dominum nostrum,\n  qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine,\n  passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus,\n  descendit ad infernos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis,\n  ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis,\n  inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos.\nCredo in Spiritum Sanctum,\n  sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem,\n  remissionem peccatorum,\n  carnis resurrectionem,\n  vitam aeternam.\nAmen.\n\nText in Greek\n\nThe Greek text is \"not normally used in Greek and Eastern Orthodox churches\"..\n\nΠιστεύω εἰς θεòν πατέρα, παντοκράτορα, ποιητὴν οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς.\nΚαὶ (εἰς) Ἰησοῦν Χριστòν, υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τòν μονογενῆ, τòν κύριον ἡμῶν,\n  τòν συλληφθέντα ἐκ πνεύματος ἁγίου, γεννηθέντα ἐκ Μαρίας τῆς παρθένου,\n  παθόντα ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πιλάτου, σταυρωθέντα, θανόντα, καὶ ταφέντα,\n  κατελθόντα εἰς τὰ κατώτατα, τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστάντα ἀπò τῶν νεκρῶν,\n  ἀνελθόντα εἰς τοὺς οὐρανούς, καθεζόμενον ἐν δεξιᾷ θεοῦ πατρὸς παντοδυνάμου,\n  ἐκεῖθεν ἐρχόμενον κρῖναι ζῶντας καὶ νεκρούς.\nΠιστεύω εἰς τò πνεῦμα τò ἅγιον, ἁγίαν καθολικὴν ἐκκλησίαν, ἁγίων κοινωνίαν,\n  ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν, σαρκὸς ἀνάστασιν, ζωὴν αἰώνιον.\nἈμήν.\n\nEnglish translations\n\nEcumenical version\n\nThe English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC) is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy. In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles' Creed, distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word \"his\" in relation to God. The text is as follows:\n\nRoman Catholic Church\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church gives the following English translation of the Apostles' Creed. In its discussion of the Creed, the Catechism maintains the traditional division into twelve articles, the numbering of which is given below.\n\nThe English text used in the Mass of the Roman Rite is at right below:.\n\nArticles 1–12 \n\nPelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvár assigned one special phrase to each apostle: Peter (№ 1), John (№ 2), James, son of Zebedee (№ 3), Andrew (№ 4), Philip (№ 5a: descendit ad infernos…), Thomas (№ 5b: ascendit ad caelos…), Bartholomew (№ 6), Matthew (№ 7), James, son of Alphaeus (№ 8), Simon (№ 9), Jude (№ 10), Matthias (№ 11–12).\n\nArticles 9–10 \n\nAnabaptist theologians fought for believer's baptism under reference to a biblical understanding of the creed:\n\nChurch of England\n\nIn the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and that of Common Worship (2000).\n\nBook of Common Prayer, 1662\nI believe in God the Father Almighty,\nMaker of heaven and earth:\n\nAnd in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,\nWho was conceived by the Holy Ghost,\nBorn of the Virgin Mary,\nSuffered under Pontius Pilate,\nWas crucified, dead, and buried:\nHe descended into hell;\nThe third day he rose again from the dead;\nHe ascended into heaven,\nAnd sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;\nFrom thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.\n\nI believe in the Holy Ghost;\nThe holy Catholick Church;\nThe Communion of Saints;\nThe Forgiveness of sins;\nThe Resurrection of the body,\nAnd the Life everlasting.\nAmen.\n\nCommon Worship\nI believe in God, the Father almighty,\ncreator of heaven and earth.\n\nI believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\nborn of the Virgin Mary,\nsuffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died, and was buried;\nhe descended to the dead.\nOn the third day he rose again;\nhe ascended into heaven,\nhe is seated at the right hand of the Father,\nand he will come to judge the living and the dead.\n\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy catholic Church,\nthe communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting.\nAmen.\n\nLutheran Church\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Worship\n\nThe publication Evangelical Lutheran Worship gives the ELLC ecumenical version, footnoting the phrase \"he descended to the dead\" to indicate the alternative reading: \"or ‘he descended into hell,’ another translation of this text in widespread use\"..\n\nLutheran Service Book\n\nThe Lutheran Service Book has the following text:\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty,\nMaker of heaven and earth.\nAnd in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\nborn of the virgin Mary,\nsuffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died and was buried.\nHe descended into hell.\nOn the third day He rose again from the dead.\nHe ascended into heaven\nand sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\nFrom thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy Christian Church,\n:the communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting. Amen...\n\nThe creed is footnoted in the LSB for the word \"Christian\": \"Christian: the ancient text reads \"catholic,\" meaning the whole Church as it confesses the wholeness of Christian doctrine.\".\n\nChurch of Denmark\n\nThe Church of Denmark still uses the phrase \"We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings\" as the beginning of this creed, before the line \"We believe in God etc.\" This is mostly due to the influence of the Danish pastor Grundtvig. See Den apostolske trosbekendelse.\n\nUnited Methodist Church\n\nThe United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the United Methodist Hymnal, one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of Methodism. It is notable for omitting the line \"he descended into hell\", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version, which includes \"he descended to the dead.\"\n\nThe United Methodist Hymnal also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).. This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in The United Methodist Book of Worship, and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\nI believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.\n\nLiturgical use in Western Christianity\n\nThe liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the Roman Missal, including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the Book of Common Prayer (Anglicans and Episcopalians), Evangelical Lutheran Worship (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), Lutheran Service Book (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod), and The United Methodist Book of Worship (The United Methodist Church), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of Baptism, which they consider to be the sacrament of initiation into the Church.\n\nCatholic Church\n\nRite of Baptism\n\nAn interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions (ICEL, 1974):\nDo you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\nThis is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nProfession of faith at Mass\n\nSince the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the Roman Missal with the indication, \"Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed, may be used.\". Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at Mass, except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.\n\nUse in the Divine Office\n\nIn the 1962 Breviary, authorized by Summorum Pontificum, the Apostles' Creed is recited at Prime and Compline on certain days during Advent and Lent as part of the Preces, a series of versicles and responses preceded by Kyrie, eleison (\"Lord, have mercy\") and the Our Father. In prior editions, it was also said after the Our Father and Hail Mary before Matins and Prime, and after Compline.\n\nAnglican Communion\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of Matins and Evening Prayer (Evensong). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the Canticles, and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the quire.\n\nEpiscopal Church (United States)\n\nThe Episcopal Church uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.\n\n1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.\n\n2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.\n\n3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: \"I do.\"\n\n3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in \"the Christian faith and life\" (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through \"prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ\" to which the parents will state to each, \"I will, with God's help.\"\n\n4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always \"I renounce them\":\n\nDo you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?\nDo you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?\nDo you renounce all sinful desires that draw you from the love of God?\n\n5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always \"I do\":\nDo you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior?\nDo you put your whole trust in his grace and love?\nDo you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?\n\n6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'\n\nLutheran Church\n\nLutherans following the Lutheran Service Book (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Church–Canada), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:\nDo you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?\n\nFollowing each question, the candidate answers by saying \"Yes, I believe\". If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions..\n\nFor ELCA Lutherans who use the Evangelical Lutheran Worship book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.\n\nMethodism\n\nMethodists use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church's sacramental act. For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.\nDo you believe in God?\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\n\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ?\nI believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit?\nI believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting..",

Amen...\n\nThe creed is footnoted in the LSB for the word \"Christian\": \"Christian: the ancient text reads \"catholic,\" meaning the whole Church as it confesses the wholeness of Christian doctrine.\".\n\nChurch of Denmark\n\nThe Church of Denmark still uses the phrase \"We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings\" as the beginning of this creed, before the line \"We believe in God etc.\" This is mostly due to the influence of the Danish pastor Grundtvig. See Den apostolske trosbekendelse.\n\nUnited Methodist Church\n\nThe United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the United Methodist Hymnal, one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of Methodism. It is notable for omitting the line \"he descended into hell\", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version, which includes \"he descended to the dead.\"\n\nThe United Methodist Hymnal also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).. This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in The United Methodist Book of Worship, and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\nI believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.\n\nLiturgical use in Western Christianity\n\nThe liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the Roman Missal, including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the Book of Common Prayer (Anglicans and Episcopalians), Evangelical Lutheran Worship (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), Lutheran Service Book (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod), and The United Methodist Book of Worship (The United Methodist Church), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of Baptism, which they consider to be the sacrament of initiation into the Church.\n\nCatholic Church\n\nRite of Baptism\n\nAn interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions (ICEL, 1974):\nDo you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\nThis is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nProfession of faith at Mass\n\nSince the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the Roman Missal with the indication, \"Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed, may be used.\". Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at Mass, except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.\n\nUse in the Divine Office\n\nIn the 1962 Breviary, authorized by Summorum Pontificum, the Apostles' Creed is recited at Prime and Compline on certain days during Advent and Lent as part of the Preces, a series of versicles and responses preceded by Kyrie, eleison (\"Lord, have mercy\") and the Our Father. In prior editions, it was also said after the Our Father and Hail Mary before Matins and Prime, and after Compline.\n\nAnglican Communion\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of Matins and Evening Prayer (Evensong). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the Canticles, and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the quire.\n\nEpiscopal Church (United States)\n\nThe Episcopal Church uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.\n\n1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.\n\n2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.\n\n3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: \"I do.\"\n\n3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in \"the Christian faith and life\" (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through \"prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ\" to which the parents will state to each, \"I will, with God's help.\"\n\n4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always \"I renounce them\":\n\nDo you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?\nDo you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?\nDo you renounce all sinful desires that draw you from the love of God?\n\n5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always \"I do\":\nDo you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior?\nDo you put your whole trust in his grace and love?\nDo you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?\n\n6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'\n\nLutheran Church\n\nLutherans following the Lutheran Service Book (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Church–Canada), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:\nDo you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?\n\nFollowing each question, the candidate answers by saying \"Yes, I believe\". If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions..\n\nFor ELCA Lutherans who use the Evangelical Lutheran Worship book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.\n\nMethodism\n\nMethodists use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church's sacramental act. For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.\nDo you believe in God?\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\n\nDo you believe in Jesus Christ?\nI believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit?\nI believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting..
