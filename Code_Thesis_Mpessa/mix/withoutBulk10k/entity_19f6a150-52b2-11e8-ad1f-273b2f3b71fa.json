The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 686 BCE, separated by approximately 15 years, and includes dramatic prophetic declarations of Cyrus the Great in the Bible, acting to restore the nation of Israel from Babylonian captivity. Another widely-held view is that parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1–39) originated with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King Josiah a hundred years later, and that the remainder of the book dates from immediately before and immediately after the end of the exile in Babylon, almost two centuries after the time of the historic prophet.\n\nJews and Christians consider the Book of Isaiah a part of their Biblical canon; he is the first listed (although not the earliest) of the Nevi'im Aharonim, the latter prophets.JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, Jewish Publication Society, 2000 Muslims consider Isaiah a prophet mentioned in Muslim exegesis of canonical scriptures.\n\nAlternative spellings include ( or;\n\n;  ˀēšaˁyā; Greek: , Ēsaïās; Latin: Isaias; Arabic: إشعيا Ašaʿyāʾ or šaʿyā;Rippin, A., “S̲h̲aʿyā”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. \"Yah is salvation\"New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale Press, Wheaton, IL, USA 1987.\n\nBiography\n\nThe first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah (). Uzziah's reign was 52 years in the middle of the 8th century BCE, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the 740s BCE. Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (who died 698 BCE). He may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as 64 years.\n\nAccording to some modern interpretations, Isaiah's wife was called \"the prophetess\" (), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah () and Huldah (), or simply because she was the \"wife of the prophet\".Coogan, Michael D. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, Oxford University Press, 2009, p.273. They had two sons, naming one Shear-jashub, meaning \"A remnant shall return\" (), and the younger, Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, meaning, \"Spoil quickly, plunder speedily\" ().\n\nSoon after this, Shalmaneser V determined to subdue the kingdom of Israel, taking over and destroying Samaria (722 BCE). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power. But when Hezekiah gained the throne, he was encouraged to rebel \"against the king of Assyria\" (), and entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (). The king of Assyria threatened the king of Judah, and at length invaded the land. Sennacherib (701 BC) led a powerful army into Judah. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians (). But after a brief interval, war broke out again. Again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (; ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \"spread before the LORD\" ().\n\nAccording to the account in 2 Kings 19 (and its derivative account in 2 Chronicles 32) the judgment of God fell on the Assyrian army and 185,000 of its men were killed in battle. \"Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either the Southern Levant or Egypt.\"Sayce, Archibald Henry. The Ancient Empires of the East. Macmillan, 1884, p. 134.\n\nThe remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful (). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh. The time and manner of his death are not specified in either the Bible or other primary sources. The Talmud [Yevamot 49b] says that he suffered martyrdom by being sawn in two under the orders of Manasseh.[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8235-isaiah \"Isaiah\", Jewish Encyclopedia] According to rabbinic literature, Isaiah was the maternal grandfather of Manasseh.\n\nSome writers assert that Isaiah was a vegetarian, on the basis of passages in the Book of Isaiah that extol nonviolence and reverence for life, such as Isaiah 1:11, 11:6-9, 65:25, and 66:3. Some of these writers refer to \"the vegetarian Isaiah\", \"the notorious vegetarian Isaiah\", and \"Isaiah, the vegetarian prophet\".\n\nThe book of Isaiah, along with the book of Jeremiah, is distinctive in the Hebrew bible for its direct portrayal of the \"wrath of the Lord\" as presented, for example, in Isaiah 9:19 stating, \"Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire.\"Isaiah 9:19.\n\nIn Christianity\n\nThe Ascension of Isaiah, a pseudegraphical Christian text dated to sometime between the end of the 1st Century to the beginning of the 3rd, gives a detailed story of Isaiah confronting an evil false prophet and ending with Isaiah being martyred - none of which is attested in the original Biblical account. \n\nGregory of Nyssa (c. 335–395), believed that the Prophet Isaiah \"knew more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel\". Jerome (c. 342–420) also lauds the Prophet Isaiah, saying, \"He was more of an Evangelist than a Prophet, because he described all of the Mysteries of the Church of Christ so vividly that you would assume he was not prophesying about the future, but rather was composing a history of past events.\"The Lives of the Holy Prophets, Holy Apostles Convent, , page 101. Of specific note are the songs of the Suffering Servant, which Christians say are a direct prophetic revelation of the nature, purpose, and detail of the death of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah is quoted many times by New Testament writers. Ten of those references are about the Suffering Servant, how he will suffer and die to save many from their sins, be buried in a rich man's tomb, and be a light to the Gentiles. The Gospel of John says that Isaiah \"saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.\"\n\nLatter-day Saints \n\nIsaiah is also a prominent prophet in the Latter-day Saint theology. Mormons consider the starting of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 11, the translation of the Book of Mormon to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 29, and the building of LDS temples as a fulfillment of Isaiah 2:2. In addition, the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants quote Isaiah more than any other prophet. The Book of Mormon quotes Jesus Christ as stating that \"great are the words of Isaiah\", and that all things prophesied by Isaiah either have been or will be fulfilled.\n\nIn Islam\n\nAlthough Isaiah is not mentioned by name in the Quran or the Hadith, Muslim sources have accepted him as a prophet.Encyclopedia of Islam Some Muslim scholars, such as Ibn Kathir and Kisa'i, reproduced Jewish traditions regarding Isaiah, which were transmitted through early Jewish converts to Islam.  Isaiah is mentioned as a prophet in Ibn Kathir's Story of Prophet Isaiah, and the modern writers Muhammad Asad and Abdullah Yusuf AliThe Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Note. 2173 to 17:4: \"The Book is the revelation given to the Children of Israel. Here it seems to refer to the burning words of Prophets like Isaiah. For example, see Isaiah, chap, 24. or Isaiah 5:20–30, or Isaiah 3:16–26.\" accepted Isaiah as a true Hebrew prophet, who preached to the Israelites following the death of King David.\nIsaiah is well known in Muslim exegesis and literature, notably for his predictions of the coming of Jesus and Muhammad.Encyclopedia of Islam, Shaya, Online Web. Isaiah's narrative in Muslim literature can be divided into three sections. The first establishes Isaiah as a prophet of Israel during the reign of Hezekiah; the second relates Isaiah's actions during the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib; and the third warns the nation of coming doom.Tabari, History of the Prophets and Kings, i, 638–45\n\nMuslim exegesis preserves a tradition parallel to the Hebrew Bible,Isaiah 38. which states that Hezekiah was king in Jerusalem during Isaiah's time. Hezekiah heard and obeyed Isaiah's advice, but could not quell the turbulence in Israel.Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir, Isaiah bin Amoz This tradition maintains that Hezekiah was a righteous man and that the turbulence worsened after him. After the death of the king, Isaiah told the people not to forsake God, and he warned Israel to cease from its persistent sin and disobedience. Muslim tradition maintains that the unrighteous of Israel in their anger sought to kill Isaiah. In a death that resembles that attributed to Isaiah in Lives of the Prophets, Muslim exegesis recounts that Isaiah was martyred by Israelites by being sawn in two.\n\nRabbinic literature\n\nAccording to the rabbinic literature, Isaiah was a descendant of the royal house of Judah and Tamar (Sotah 10b). He was the son of Amoz (not to be confused with Prophet Amos), who was the brother of King Amaziah of Judah. (Talmud tractate Megillah 15a).\n\nNotes",
