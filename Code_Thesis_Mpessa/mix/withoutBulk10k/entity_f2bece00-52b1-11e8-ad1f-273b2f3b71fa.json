  "textBody" : "In cooking, espagnole sauce is one of Auguste Escoffier's five mother sauces that are the basis of sauce-making in classic French cooking.  This type of sauce was already compiled in different Spanish cooking handbooks of the late 19th century.[http://www.casadellibro.com/libro-novisimo-manual-practico-de-cocina-espanola-francesa-y-american-a-ed-facsimil-de-la-ed-de-1885/9788497610940/939008 Novísimo Manual de Cocina Española, Francesa y Americana (1885)].

Escoffier popularized the recipe, which is still followed today.Escoffier (1903), Le Guide culinaire, Editions Flammarion\n\nEspagnole has a strong taste and is rarely used directly on food. As a mother sauce it serves as the starting point for many derivatives, such as Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bourguignonne, sauce aux champignons, sauce charcutière, sauce chasseur, Sauce Chevreuil and demi-glace.  There are hundreds of other derivatives in the classical French repertoire.\n\nEscoffier included a recipe for a Lenten espagnole sauce, using fish stock and mushrooms, in Le Guide culinaire, but doubted its necessity.\n\nPreparation\n\nThe basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown roux, to which veal stock or water is added, along with  browned bones, pieces of beef, vegetables, and various seasonings.  This blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. The classic recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces, but today water is generally used instead. Tomato paste or pureed tomatoes are added towards the end of the process, and the sauce is further reduced.\n\nEtymology\n\nAlthough espagnole is the French word for Spanish, the sauce's connection to Spanish cuisine is argued by French cooks.  According to Louis Diat, the creator of vichyssoise and the author of the classic Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook: \"There is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in French cuisine is called sauce espagnole, or Spanish sauce.  According to the story, the Spanish cooks of Louis XIII's bride, Anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of France with Spanish tomatoes.  This new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honor of its creators.\"\n\nIn Kettner's Book of the Table, published in 1877, there is an entirely different explanation:\n\nThe name Kettner in the title refers to Auguste Kettner, former chef to Napoleon III, who emigrated to England and in 1867 opened a restaurant in Soho—[http://www.kettners.com/ Kettner's]—one of the oldest restaurants in London.",
