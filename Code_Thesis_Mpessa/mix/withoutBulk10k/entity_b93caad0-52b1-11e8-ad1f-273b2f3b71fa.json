  "textBody" : "The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its south polar location and, thus, by ice.  The Antarctic continent, located in the Earth's southern hemisphere, is centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle.  It is washed by the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean or, depending on definition, the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. It has an area of more than 14 million km².\n\nSome 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the world's largest ice sheet and also its largest reservoir of fresh water.  Averaging at least 1.6 km thick, the ice is so massive that it has depressed the continental bedrock in some areas more than 2.5 km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur (e.g., Lake Vostok).  Ice shelves and rises populate the ice sheet on the periphery.\n\nRegions\n\nPhysically, Antarctica is divided in two by Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. Western Antarctica and Eastern Antarctica correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian. This usage has been regarded as Eurocentric by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.\n\nLesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this ice sheet, because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.\n\nVolcanoes\n\nThere are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are\nconsidered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or \n\"recent\" tephra deposits: \nMount Melbourne (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; \nMount Berlin (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; \nMount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and \nMount Hampton (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.\n \nSeveral volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.\nMount Erebus (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on\nRoss Island with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.\nOn the opposite side of the continent, \nDeception Island\n(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known\nand 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.\nBuckle Island in the Balleny Islands (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), \nPenguin Island (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), \nPaulet Island (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and \nLindenberg Island (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also \nconsidered to be active.
