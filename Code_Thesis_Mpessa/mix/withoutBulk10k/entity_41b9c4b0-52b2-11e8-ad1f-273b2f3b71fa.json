  "textBody" : "Mychal Judge, O.F.M. (aka Michael Fallon Judge, May 11, 1933 – September 11, 2001), was a Franciscan friar and  Catholic priest who served as a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. It was while serving in that capacity that he was killed, becoming the first certified fatality of the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nEarly life\n\nMychal Judge was born Robert Emmett Judge on May 11, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants from County Leitrim, Ireland, and the firstborn of a pair of fraternal twins. His twin sister Dympna was born two days later. Judge was baptized in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn on June 4. They and their older sister Erin, grew up during the Great Depression. \n\nFrom the ages of three to six, he watched his father suffer and die of mastoiditis, a slow and painful illness of the skull and inner ear. To earn income following his father's death, Judge shined shoes at New York Penn Station and would visit St. Francis of Assisi Church, located across the street. Seeing the Franciscan friars there, he later said, \"I realized that I didn't care for material things... I knew then that I wanted to be a friar.\"\n\nCareer\n\nAfter spending his freshman year at the St. Francis Preparatory School in Brooklyn, where he studied under the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn, in 1948, at the age of 15, Judge began the formation process to enter the Order of Friars Minor. He transferred to St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary in Callicoon, New York, the minor seminary of the Holy Name Province of the Order. After graduation, he enrolled at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York. In 1954 he was admitted to the novitiate of the Province in Paterson, New Jersey. After completing that year of formation, he received the religious habit and professed his first vows as a member of the Order. At that time, he was given the religious name of Fallon Michael. (He later dropped 'Fallon' and changed 'Michael' to Mychal). He resumed his college studies at St. Bonaventure University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957. He professed his solemn vows as a full member of the Order in 1958. Following this, he did his theological studies at Holy Name College Seminary in Washington, D.C.. Upon completing these studies in 1961, he was ordained a priest.\n\nAfter his ordination, Judge was assigned to the Shrine of St. Anthony in Boston, Massachusetts. Following his assignment there, he served in various parishes served by the Franciscans: St. Joseph Parish in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Sacred Heart Parish in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, Holy Cross Parish in the Bronx and St. Joseph Parish in West Milford, New Jersey. For three years he served as assistant to the President of Siena College, operated by the Franciscans in Loudonville, New York. In 1986 he was assigned to St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan, where he had first come to know the friars. He lived and worked there until his death.\n\nAround 1971, Judge developed alcoholism, although he never showed obvious signs. In 1978, with the support of Alcoholics Anonymous, he became sober and continued to share his personal story of alcoholism to help others facing addiction.\n\nIn 1992, Judge was appointed a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. As chaplain, he offered encouragement and prayers at fires, rescues, and hospitals, and counseled firemen and their families, often working 16-hour days. \"His whole ministry was about love. Mychal loved the fire department and they loved him.\"[http://www.saintof9-11.com/saint/main.cfm Saint of 9/11 (film) homepage]  spoken by Mychal McNichols in the film, Saint of 9/11 (2006) He was a member of AFSCME Local 299 (District Council 37).[http://my.firedoglake.com/geraldmcentee/2011/09/09/we-remember/#more-73198 \"We Remember\"] McEntee, Gerald. firedoglake.com. September 9, 2011\n\nJudge was also well known in the city for ministering to the homeless, the hungry, recovering alcoholics, people with AIDS, the sick, injured, and grieving, immigrants, gays and lesbians and those alienated by the Church and society. For example, Judge once gave the winter coat off his back to a homeless woman in the street, later saying, \"She needed it more than me.\" When he anointed a man who was dying of AIDS, the man asked him, \"Do you think God hates me?\" Judge just picked him up, kissed him, and silently rocked him in his arms.Saint of 9/11 film (2006)\n\nEven before his death, many considered Judge to be a living saint for his extraordinary works of charity and his deep spirituality. While praying, he would sometimes \"become so lost in God, as if lost in a trance, that he'd be shocked to find several hours had passed.\" Judge's former spiritual director, former Jesuit John J. McNeill, observed that Judge achieved an \"extraordinary degree of union with the divine. We knew we were dealing with someone directly in line with God.\"\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\n\nOn September 11, 2001, upon learning that the World Trade Center had been hit by the first of two jetliners, Judge rushed to the site. He was met by Rudolph Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, who asked him to pray for the city and its victims. Judge prayed over some bodies lying on the streets, then entered the lobby of the World Trade Center North Tower, where an emergency command post had been organized. There he continued offering aid and prayers for the rescuers, the injured, and the dead.\n\nWhen the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 am, debris went flying through the North Tower lobby, killing many inside, including Judge. At the moment he was struck in the head and killed, Judge was repeatedly praying aloud, \"Jesus, please end this right now! God, please end this!\", according to Judge's biographer and New York Daily News columnist Michael Daly.[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2002/09/11/2002-09-11_they_made_america__the_beaut.html (dead link)] .

According to Fire Department Commissioner Thomas Von Essen: \"I actually knew about his homosexuality when I was in the Uniformed Firefighters Association. I kept the secret, but then he told me when I became commissioner five years ago. He and I often laughed about it, because we knew how difficult it would have been for the other firemen to accept it as easily as I had. I just thought he was a phenomenal, warm, sincere man, and the fact that he was gay just had nothing to do with anything.\"\n\nThe revelations about  sexual orientation were not without controversy, however. Dennis Lynch, a lawyer, wrote an article about Judge that appeared on the website catholic.org. Lynch claimed that Judge was not gay and that any attempt to define him as gay was due to \"homosexual activists\" who wanted to \"attack the Catholic Church\" and turn the priest into a \"homosexual icon\".Lynch, Dennis (June 26, 2002). [http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=19 \"A September 11th Hijacking\"]. Catholic Online. Others refuted Lynch’s claims with evidence that Judge did in fact identify himself as gay, both to others and in his personal journals.[http://saintmychaljudge.blogspot.com/search/label/Gay%20Saint/ A Gay Saint in fact]\n\nJudge was a long-term member of Dignity, a Catholic LGBT activist organization that advocates for change in the Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality.[http://www.dignityusa.org/faq.html#1 \"What is Dignity?\"]  DignityUSA. On October 1, 1986, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued an encyclical, On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons,[http://www.dignityusa.org/1986doctrine/ratzinger.html \"Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\"] . DignityUSA.  which declared homosexuality to be a \"strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil\". In response, many bishops, including John Cardinal O'Connor, banned Dignity from diocesan churches under their control. Judge then welcomed Dignity's AIDS ministry to the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, which is under the control of the Franciscan friars, thereby partially circumventing the cardinal's ban of Dignity.\n\nJudge disagreed with official Roman Catholic teaching regarding homosexuality, though by all accounts he remained celibate. Judge often asked, \"Is there so much love in the world that we can afford to discriminate against any kind of love?\"",

Every September 11, there is a Mass in memory of Judge in Boston, attended by many who lost family members on 9/11.McGonegal, Joe (September 16, 2008).

Wicked Local.\n\nAt the National 9/11 Memorial, Judge is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-18, where other first responders are located.\n\nIn 2014 Judge was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people. \n\nIn 2015 a statue was dedicated to Judge at St. Joseph's Park in East Rutherford, New Jersey, across the street from St. Joseph's Parish where he served for several years.\n\nIn recognition of his heroic actions and his commitment to the dignity of LGBTQ people, Judge was posthumously awarded the Dooley Award by GALA-ND/SMC, an alumni organization of the University of Notre Dame, a prominent American Catholic university.http://www.galandsmc.org/dooley-award-recipients/\n\nGay orientation and affiliations\n\nFollowing his death, a few of Judge's friends and associates revealed that Judge was gay – as a matter of orientation rather than practice, as he was a celibate priest. According to Fire Department Commissioner Thomas Von Essen: \"I actually knew about his homosexuality when I was in the Uniformed Firefighters Association. I kept the secret, but then he told me when I became commissioner five years ago. He and I often laughed about it, because we knew how difficult it would have been for the other firemen to accept it as easily as I had. I just thought he was a phenomenal, warm, sincere man, and the fact that he was gay just had nothing to do with anything.\"\n\nThe revelations about  sexual orientation were not without controversy, however. Dennis Lynch, a lawyer, wrote an article about Judge that appeared on the website catholic.org. Lynch claimed that Judge was not gay and that any attempt to define him as gay was due to \"homosexual activists\" who wanted to \"attack the Catholic Church\" and turn the priest into a \"homosexual icon\".Lynch, Dennis (June 26, 2002). [http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=19 \"A September 11th Hijacking\"]. Catholic Online. Others refuted Lynch’s claims with evidence that Judge did in fact identify himself as gay, both to others and in his personal journals.[http://saintmychaljudge.blogspot.com/search/label/Gay%20Saint/ A Gay Saint in fact]\n\nJudge was a long-term member of Dignity, a Catholic LGBT activist organization that advocates for change in the Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality.[http://www.dignityusa.org/faq.html#1 \"What is Dignity?\"]  DignityUSA. On October 1, 1986, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued an encyclical, On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons,[http://www.dignityusa.org/1986doctrine/ratzinger.html \"Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\"] . DignityUSA.  which declared homosexuality to be a \"strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil\". In response, many bishops, including John Cardinal O'Connor, banned Dignity from diocesan churches under their control. Judge then welcomed Dignity's AIDS ministry to the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, which is under the control of the Franciscan friars, thereby partially circumventing the cardinal's ban of Dignity.\n\nJudge disagreed with official Roman Catholic teaching regarding homosexuality, though by all accounts he remained celibate. Judge often asked, \"Is there so much love in the world that we can afford to discriminate against any kind of love?\". Mychal Judge. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=20360."
