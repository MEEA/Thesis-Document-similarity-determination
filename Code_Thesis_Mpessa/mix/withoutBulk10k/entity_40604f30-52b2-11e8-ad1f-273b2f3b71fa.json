  "textBody" : "Marcus Aurelius (; ;In Classical Latin, Aurelius' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS.Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 315–403), in his chronology of the Roman emperors, calls him Marcus Aurelius Verus (vide: Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures – The Syriac Version (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32) 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD) was Roman emperor from , ruling jointly with Lucius Verus until Verus' death in 169 and jointly with his son, Commodus, from 177. He was the last of the so-called Five Good Emperors.\n\nHe was a practitioner of Stoicism, and his untitled writing, commonly known as Meditations, is a significant source of our modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. It is considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy. \n\nDuring his reign, the Roman Empire defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in the East: Aurelius' general Avidius Cassius sacked the capital Ctesiphon in 164. In central Europe, Aurelius fought the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, although the threat of the Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. A revolt in the East led by Avidius Cassius failed to gain momentum and was suppressed immediately. Persecution of Christians increased during his reign.\n\nHis death in 180 is considered the end of the Pax Romana[https://books.google.it/books?idLkgrDwAAQBAJ&pg\nPT85&dqmarcus+aurelius+death+end+of+pax+romana&hl\nit&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwj7xK_Ki97WAhWGL8AKHfsOCVgQ6AEIPjAE#vonepage&q\nmarcus%20aurelius%20death%20end%20of%20pax%20romana&f=false] and the increasing instability in the west that followed has traditionally been seen as the beginning of the eventual Fall of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nSources\n\nThe major sources depicting the life and rule of Marcus Aurelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the Historia Augusta, claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century AD, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as \"the biographer\") from the later 4th century (c. 395 AD).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 229–30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's \"Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der Scriptoes Historiae Augustae\" (in German), Hermes 24 (1889), 337ff.\n\nThe later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources (Marius Maximus or Ignotus), are much more accurate. For Marcus' life and rule, the biographies of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are full of fiction.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 230. On the HA Verus, see Barnes, 65–74.\n\nA body of correspondence between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.Mary Beard, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n14/bear01_.html Was He Quite Ordinary?]\", London Review of Books 31:14 (23 July 2009), accessed 15 September 2009; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 226. Marcus' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 227. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 228–29, 253.\n\nSome other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 227–28. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 228.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nMarcus' family originated in Ucubi, a small town southeast of Córdoba in Iberian Baetica. The family rose to prominence in the late 1st century AD. Marcus' great-grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (I) was a senator and (according to the Historia Augusta) ex-praetor; in 73–74, his grandfather, Marcus Annius Verus (II), was made a patrician.HA Marcus 1.2, 1.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 28; McLynn, 14. Verus' elder son—Marcus Aurelius' father—Marcus Annius Verus (III) married Domitia Lucilla.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 29; McLynn, 14. \n\nLucilla was the daughter of the patrician P. Calvisius Tullus Ruso and the elder Domitia Lucilla. The elder Domitia Lucilla had inherited a great fortune (described at length in one of Pliny's letters) from her maternal grandfather and her paternal grandfather by adoption.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 29, citing Pliny, Epistulae 8.18. The younger Lucilla would acquire much of her mother's wealth, including a large brickworks on the outskirts of Rome—a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 30.\n\nLucilla and Verus (III) had two children: a son, Marcus, born on 26 April 121 AD, and a daughter, Annia Cornificia Faustina, probably born in 122 or 123 AD.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31, 44. Verus (III) probably died in 124 AD, during his praetorship, when Marcus was only three years old.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31. Though he can hardly have known him, Marcus Aurelius wrote in his Meditations that he had learned \"modesty and manliness\" from his memories of his father and from the man's posthumous reputation.Meditations 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31. Lucilla did not remarry.\n\nLucilla, following prevailing aristocratic customs, probably did not spend much time with her son. Marcus was in the care of \"nurses\".HA Marcus 2.1 and Meditations 5.4, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 32. Even so, Marcus credits his mother with teaching him \"religious piety, simplicity in diet\" and how to avoid \"the ways of the rich\".Meditations 1.3, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. In his letters, Marcus makes frequent and affectionate reference to her; he was grateful that, \"although she was fated to die young, yet she spent her last years with me\".Meditations 1.17.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35.\n\nAfter his father's death, Aurelius was raised by his paternal grandfather Marcus Annius Verus who, according to Roman Law, had always retained the \"patria potestas\" over his son and grandson. Technically this was not an adoption, since an adoption would be the legal creation of a new and different \"patria potestas\" (II).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 33. Another man, Lucius Catilius Severus, also participated in his upbringing. Severus is described as Marcus' \"maternal great-grandfather\"; he is probably the stepfather of the elder Lucilla. Marcus was raised in his parents' home on the Caelian Hill, a district he would affectionately refer to as \"my Caelian\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 2.8.2 (= Haines 1.142), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31.\n\nIt was an upscale region, with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas. Marcus' grandfather owned his own palace beside the Lateran, where Marcus would spend much of his childhood.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31–32. Marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him \"good character and avoidance of bad temper\".Meditations 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. He was less fond of the mistress his grandfather took and lived with after the death of Rupilia Faustina, his wife.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. Marcus was grateful that he did not have to live with her longer than he did.Meditations 1.17.2; Farquharson, 1.102; McLynn, 23; cf. Meditations 1.17.11; Farquharson, 1.103.\n\nMarcus was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends;McLynn, 20–21. Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools.Meditations 1.4; McLynn, 20. One of his teachers, Diognetus, a painting-master, proved particularly influential; he seems to have introduced Marcus to the philosophic way of life.HA Marcus 2.2, 4.9; Meditations 1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 37; McLynn, 21–22. In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough Greek cloak, and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.HA Marcus 2.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 38; McLynn, 21.\n\nA new set of tutors—Alexander of Cotiaeum, Trosius Aper and Tuticius Proculus—took over Marcus' education in about 132 or 133.HA Marcus 2.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40, 270 n.27. Little is known of the latter two (both teachers of Latin), but Alexander was a major littérateur, the leading Homeric scholar of his day.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40, citing Aelius Aristides, Oratio 32 K; McLynn, 21. Marcus thanks Alexander for his training in literary styling.Meditations 1.10; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40; McLynn, 22. Alexander's influence—an emphasis on matter over style, on careful wording, with the occasional Homeric quotation—has been detected in Marcus' Meditations.Birley,  Marcus Aurelius, 40, 270 n.28, citing A.S.L. Farquharson, The Meditations of Marcus Antoninus (Oxford, 1944) 2.453.\n\nSuccession to Hadrian, 136–138\n\nIn late 136, Hadrian almost died from a haemorrhage. Convalescent in his villa at Tivoli, he selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus, Marcus' intended father-in-law, as his successor and adopted him as his son.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 41–42. The selection was done invitis omnibus, \"against the wishes of everyone\".HA Hadrian 23.10, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 42. While there will never be absolute certainty regarding his motives, it would appear that his goal was to eventually place the then-too-young Marcus on the throne.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 42. A Companion to Marcus Aurelius, ch. 8, p. 142. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, \"Hadrian and Lucius Verus\", Journal of Roman Studies 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, \"Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo\", Phoenix 49:4 (1995): 319–30. As part of his adoption, Commodus took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar. His health was so poor that during a ceremony to mark his becoming heir to the throne, he was too weak to lift a large shield on his own.HA Aelius 6.2-3 After a brief stationing on the Danube frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage later in the day.HA Hadrian 23.15–16; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 45; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 148. \n\nOn 24 January 138 AD, Hadrian selected Aurelius Antoninus, the husband of Marcus' aunt Faustina the Elder as his new successor.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 46. Date: Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 148.  After a few days' consideration, Antoninus accepted. He was adopted on 25 February. As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus adopted Marcus and Lucius Verus, the son of  Lucius Aelius. By this scheme,  Lucius Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his new father.\n\nMarcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus; Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At Hadrian's request, Antoninus' daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.Dio 69.21.1; HA Hadrian 24.1; HA Aelius 6.9; HA Antoninus Pius 4.6–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 48–49. He reportedly greeted the news that Hadrian had become his adoptive grandfather with sadness, instead of joy. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.HA Marcus 5.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 49.\n\nAt some time in 138 AD, Hadrian requested in the senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming quaestor before his twenty-fourth birthday. The senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, consul for 139.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 49–50. Marcus' adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. If not for his adoption, he probably would have become triumvir monetalis, a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as tribune with a legion, becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: \"He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household.\"HA Marcus 5.6–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 50.\n\nAfter a series of suicide attempts, all thwarted by Antoninus, Hadrian left for Baiae, a seaside resort on the Campanian coast. His condition did not improve, and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors, indulging himself in food and drink. He sent for Antoninus, who was at his side when he died on 10 July 138.Dio 69.22.4; HA Hadrian 25.5–6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 50–51. Hadrian's suicide attempts: Dio 69.22.1–4; HA Hadrian 24.8–13. His remains were buried quietly at Puteoli.HA Hadrian 25.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 53. The succession to Antoninus was peaceful and stable: Antoninus kept Hadrian's nominees in office and appeased the senate, respecting its privileges and commuting the death sentences of men charged in Hadrian's last days.HA Antoninus Pius 5.3, 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 55–56; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 151. For his dutiful behavior, Antoninus was asked to accept the name \"Pius\".Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 55; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 151.\n\nHeir to Antoninus Pius, 138–145\n\nImmediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.HA Marcus 6.2; Verus 2.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 53–54.\n\nAntoninus bolstered Marcus' dignity: Marcus was made consul for 140 AD, with Antoninus as his colleague, and was appointed as a seviri, one of the knights' six commanders, at the order's annual parade on 15 July 139 AD. As the heir apparent, Marcus became princeps iuventutis, head of the equestrian order. He now took the name Caesar: Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar.Dio 71.35.5; HA Marcus 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 56. Marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously: \"See that you do not turn into a Caesar; do not be dipped into the purple dye—for that can happen\".Meditations 6.30, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57; cf. Marcus Aurelius, 270 n.9, with notes on the translation. At the senate's request, Marcus joined all the priestly colleges (pontifices, augures, quindecimviri sacris faciundis, septemviri epulonum, etc.);HA Marcus 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57. direct evidence for membership, however, is available only for the Arval Brethren.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57, 272 n.10, citing Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224044/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nCIL+06,+00032&r_sortierungBelegstelle 6.32], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224054/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nCIL+06,+00379&r_sortierungBelegstelle 6.379], cf. Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224059/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nD+00360&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 360].\n\nAntoninus demanded that Marcus take up residence in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Antoninus also made him take up the habits of his new station, the aulicum fastigium or \"pomp of the court\", against Marcus' objections. Marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings. He told himself it was an attainable goal—\"where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace\"Meditations 5.16, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57.—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the Meditations for \"abusing court life\" in front of company.Meditations 8.9, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57.\n\nAs quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do. He would read imperial letters to the senate when Antoninus was absent, and would do secretarial work for the senators. His duties as consul were more significant: one of two senior representatives of the senate, he would preside over meetings and take a major role in the body's administrative functions.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57–58. He felt drowned in paperwork, and complained to his tutor, Fronto: \"I am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 90. He was being \"fitted for ruling the state\", in the words of his biographer.HA Marcus 6.5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 58. He was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well, making oratorical training essential for the job.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89.\n\nOn 1 January 145 AD, Marcus was made consul a second time. He might have been unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto that might have been sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep \"so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 5.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89. Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: \"As far as my strength is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89. Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.Dio 71.36.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89.\n\nIn April 145 AD, Marcus married Faustina, as had been planned since 138 AD. Since Marcus was, by adoption, Antoninus Pius' son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his patria potestas) for the ceremony to take place.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 90–91. Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been \"noteworthy\".HA Antoninus Pius 10.2, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 91. Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as Pontifex Maximus, would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina.Birley, Marcus Unko Aurelius, 91.\n\nFronto and further education, 136–161\n\nAfter taking the toga virilis in 136 AD, Marcus probably began his training in oratory.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 61. He had three tutors in Greek, Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and Herodes Atticus, and one in Latin, Fronto. The latter two were the most esteemed orators of the day.HA Marcus 3.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 62. (Fronto and Atticus, however, probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by Antoninus in 138 AD.) The preponderance of Greek tutors indicates the importance of the Greek language to the aristocracy of Rome.HA Marcus 2.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 62. This was the age of the Second Sophistic, a renaissance in Greek letters. Although educated in Rome, in his Meditations, Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's Marcus Aurelius, Classical Review 17:3 (1967): 347.\n\nHerodes Atticus was controversial: an enormously rich Athenian (probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger, and resented by his fellow-Athenians for his patronizing manner.Vita Sophistae 2.1.14; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 63–64. Atticus was an inveterate opponent of Stoicism and philosophic pretensions.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 9.2.1–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 64–65. He thought the Stoics' desire for a \"lack of feeling\" foolish: they would live a \"sluggish, enervated life\", he said.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 19.12, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65. Marcus would become a Stoic. He would not mention Herodes at all in his Meditations, in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65.\n\nFronto was highly esteemed: in the self-consciously antiquarian world of Latin letters,Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 67–68, citing Edward Champlin, Fronto and Antonine Rome (1980), esp. chs. 3 and 4. he was thought of as second only to Cicero, perhaps even an alternative to him.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65–67. He did not care much for Herodes, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure synonyms, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.\n\nA significant amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69. The pair were very close. \"Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are not here.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.6 (\n Haines 1.80ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 76. Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.6 (= Haines 1.80ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 76–77.\n\nHe wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn \"from the lips of Fronto\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.10–11 (Haines 1.50ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 73. His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always sufferingBirley, Marcus Aurelius, 73.—about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses.Champlin, \"Chronology of Fronto\", 138. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, \"of my own accord with every kind of discomfort\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 5.74 ( \nHaines 2.52ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 73.\n\nFronto never became Marcus' full-time teacher, and continued his career as an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 77. On the date, see Champlin, \"Chronology of Fronto\", 142, who (with Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire (1964), 93ff) argues for a date in the 150s; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 78–79, 273 n.17 (with Ameling, Herodes Atticus (1983), 1.61ff, 2.30ff) argues for 140. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with \"advice\", then as a \"favor\", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows.Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.2 (Haines 1.58ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 77–78. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), allowed that Marcus might be correct,Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.3 (\n Haines 1.62ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 78. but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary: \"...the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.3 (= Haines 1.62ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 79. The outcome of the trial is unknown.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 80.\n\nBy the age of twenty-five (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in jurisprudence, and showed some signs of general malaise. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an unpleasant blowhard, and had made \"a hit at\" him: \"It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to be a judge is noble work.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.13 (Haines 1.214ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 93. Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.3.1 (\n Haines 1.2ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94. In any case, Marcus' formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. It \"affected his health adversely\", his biographer writes, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. It was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in Marcus' entire boyhood.HA Marcus 3.5–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94.\n\nFronto had warned Marcus against the study of philosophy early on: \"it is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy...than to have tasted it superficially, with the edge of the lips, as the saying is\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.3, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69. He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle. Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' \"conversion to philosophy\": \"in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work\", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training.De Eloquentia 4.5 (\n Haines 2.74), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95. Alan Cameron, in his review of Birley's biography (The Classical Review 17:3 (1967): 347), suggests a reference to chapter 11 of Arthur Darby Nock's Conversion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933, rept. 1961): \"Conversion to Philosophy\". Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94, 105.\n\nApollonius may have introduced Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but Quintus Junius Rusticus would have the strongest influence on the boy.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95; Champlin, Fronto, 120. He was the man Fronto recognized as having \"wooed Marcus away\" from oratory.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.36), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95. He was twenty years older than Marcus, older than Fronto. As the grandson of Arulenus Rusticus, one of the martyrs to the tyranny of Domitian (r. 81–96), he was heir to the tradition of \"Stoic Opposition\" to the \"bad emperors\" of the 1st century;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94–95, 101. the true successor of Seneca (as opposed to Fronto, the false one).Champlin, Fronto, 120. Marcus thanks Rusticus for teaching him \"not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts...To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing'\".Meditations 1.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94–95.\n\nBirths and deaths, 147–160\n\nOn November 30, 147, Faustina gave birth to a girl, named Domitia Faustina. She was the first of at least thirteen children (including two sets of twins) that Faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Antoninus Pius gave Marcus the tribunician power and the imperium—authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, Marcus had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four Antoninus could introduce. His tribunican powers would be renewed, with Antoninus', on 10 December 147.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103.\n\nThe first mention of Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals her as a sickly infant. \"Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery. The diarrhea has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing.\" He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been \"pretty occupied\" with the girl's care.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.11 (= Haines 1.202ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 105. Domitia would die in 151.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 247 F.1.\n\nIn 149, Faustina gave birth again, to twin sons. Contemporary coinage commemorates the event, with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys, and the legend temporum felicitas, \"the happiness of the times\". They did not survive long. Before the end of the year, another family coin was issued: it shows only a tiny girl, Domitia Faustina, and one boy baby. Then another: the girl alone. The infants were buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian, where their epitaphs survive. They were called Titus Aurelius Antoninus and Tiberius Aelius Aurelius.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 206–07.\n\nMarcus steadied himself: \"One man prays: 'How I may not lose my little child', but you must pray: 'How I may not be afraid to lose him'.\"Meditations 9.40, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 207. He quoted from the Iliad what he called the \"briefest and most familiar saying...enough to dispel sorrow and fear\":                                                        leaves,\nthe wind scatters some on the face of the ground;\nlike unto them are the children of men.\n– Iliad 6.146Meditations 10.34, tr. Farquharson, 78, 224.Another daughter was born on 7 March 150, Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla. At some time between 155 and 161, probably soon after 155, Marcus' mother, Domitia Lucilla, died.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107. Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, might not have been born until 153.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107–08. Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152. A coin issue celebrates fecunditati Augustae, \"the Augusta's fertility\", depicting two girls and an infant. The boy did not survive long; on coins from 156, only the two girls were depicted. He might have died in 152, the same year as Marcus' sister, Cornificia.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108.\n\nBy 28 March 158, however, when Marcus replied, the child was dead, Marcus thanked the temple synod, \"even though this turned out otherwise\". The child's name is unknown.Inscriptiones Graecae ad Res Romanas pertinentes 4.1399, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. In 159 and 160, Faustina gave birth to daughters: Fadilla, after one of Faustina's dead sisters, and Cornificia, after Marcus' dead sister.Birley, 114.\n\nAntoninus Pius' last years, 152–161\n\nMeanwhile, during the reign of his adoptive father, Antoninus, as a prince and future emperor, Marcus' adoptive brother Lucius Verus received careful education from the famous “grammaticus” Marcus Cornelius Fronto. The young Verus was reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Lucius started his political career as a quaestor in 153, two years before the legal age of 25 (Marcus held the office at 17). In 154, he was consul, nine years before the legal age of 32 (Marcus held the office at 18 and 23), and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.\n\nLucius had no other titles, except that of \"son of Augustus\". Lucius had a markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds, but especially hunting and wrestling; he took obvious pleasure in the circus games and gladiatorial fights.HA Verus 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108. He did not marry until 164.HA Verus 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Barnes, 68; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108.\n\nIn 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still when he became the praetorian prefect (an office that was as much secretarial as military) as Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 112. In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.\n\nTwo days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at Lorium, in Etruria,Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7 about 19 kilometres (12 mi) from Rome.Victor, 15:7 He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,Dio 71.33.4–5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password—\"aequanimitas\" (equanimity).Bury, pg. 532 He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.HA Antoninus Pius 12.4–8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus, surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months.Bowman, pg. 156\n\nEmperor\n\nAccession of Marcus and Lucius, 161\n\nAfter the death of Antoninus Pius, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow. The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title imperator, and he would soon be formally elected as Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was \"compelled\" to take imperial power.HA Marcus 7.5, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. This may have been a genuine horror imperii, \"fear of imperial power\". Marcus, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear. It was his duty.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. Birley takes the phrase horror imperii from HA Pert. 13.1 and 15.8.\n\nAlthough Marcus showed no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his Meditations), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 156. Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.HA Verus 3.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 156. The senate accepted, granting Lucius the imperium, the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.HA Verus 4.1; Marcus 7.5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116–17. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.\n\nIn spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more auctoritas, or \"authority\", than Lucius. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Antoninus' administration, and he alone was Pontifex Maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, \"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.\"HA Verus 4.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117, 278 n.4.\n\nImmediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative.HA Marcus 7.9; Verus 4.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117–18. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, with more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.HA Marcus 7.9; Verus 4.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117–18. \"twice the size\": Richard Duncan-Jones, Structure and Scale in the Roman Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 109. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118.\n\nUpon his accession he also devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 83.5% to 79%—the silver weight dropping from 2.68 grams to 2.57 grams. However, Marcus would later revisit the issue of currency reform.\n\nAntoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, \"elaborate\".HA Marcus 7.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118, 278 n.6. If his funeral followed those of his predecessors, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, and his spirit would have been seen as ascending to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now Divus Antoninus. Antoninus Pius' remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself.HA Marcus 7.10–11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118. The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.\n\nIn accordance with his will, Antoninus' fortune passed on to Faustina.HA Antoninus Pius 12.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118–19. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.HA Marcus 7.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other.HA Comm. 1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus.HA Comm. 1.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. Aside from the fact that the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children.HA Comm. 1.4, 10.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 155ff.; 949ff.\n\nEarly rule, 161–162\n\nSoon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).HA Marcus 7.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118. At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118, citing Werner Eck, Die Organization Italiens (1979), 146ff. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, \"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\"HA Marcus 8.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 157.\n\nMarcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ab epistulis Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of Pannonia and had served in the war in Mauretania. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 122–23, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain I–III (Paris, 1960–61); Supplément (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, Roman Britain and the Roman Army (1953), 142ff., 151ff. Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus' former tutor, had been prefectural governor of Egypt at Marcus' accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (aerarium Saturni). He was made consul soon after.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain I–III (Paris, 1960–61); Supplément (Paris, 1982), no. 141. Fronto's son-in-law, Aufidius Victorinus, was appointed governor of Upper Germany.HA Marcus 8.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing W. Eck, Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen (1985), 65ff.\n\nFronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator 1.3.2 (Haines 1.298ff). The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\"Ad Antoninum Imperator 4.2.3 (\n Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120.\n\nLucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator 1.1 (Haines 1.305). Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for \"some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus—or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.\"Ad Antoninum Imperator 4.1 (\n Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120.\n\nMarcus' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.HA Marcus 8.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120. Soon, however, Marcus would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the felicitas temporum (\"happy times\") that the coinage of 161 had so glibly proclaimed.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845.\n\nIn the spring of 162, the Tiber overflowed its banks, flooding much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.HA Marcus 8.4–5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.HA Marcus 11.3, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 278 n.16.\n\nFronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was \"beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence\".Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128. Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: \"Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape.\"De eloquentia 1.12 (\n Haines 2.63–65), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128.\n\nThe early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (Haines 2.35); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127–28. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: \"not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech\". Fronto was hugely pleased.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.4 (\n Haines 2.41–43), tr. Haines; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128.\n\nWar with Parthia, 161–166\n\nOrigins to Lucius' dispatch, 161–162\n\nOn his deathbed, Antoninus Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.HA Antoninus Pius 12.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114, 121. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.Event: HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. Date: Jaap-Jan Flinterman, \"The Date of Lucian's Visit to Abonuteichos,\" Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 119 (1997): 281. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121.\n\nConvinced by the prophet Alexander of Abonutichus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself,Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121–22. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241–50. Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX HispanaBirley, Marcus Aurelius, 278 n.19.) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 21, 24, 25; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121–22.\n\nThere was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes.HA Marcus 8.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 122. Marcus was unprepared. Antoninus seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Antoninus' twenty-three-year reign at his emperor's side—and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.HA Antoninus Pius 7.11; Marcus 7.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103–04, 122.\n\nMore bad news arrived: the Syrian governor's army had been defeated by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223837/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelleCIL+08,+07050&r_sortierung\nBelegstelle 8.7050]–[https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223843/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelleCIL+08,+07051&r_sortierung\nBelegstelle 51]; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123.

Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.HA Verus 9.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125.\n\nMarcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the coast of Etruria. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.De Feriis Alsiensibus 1 (Haines 2.3); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. Fronto replied ironically: \"What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking, and complete leisure for four whole days?\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.1 (\n Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Antoninus had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy),De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.4 (Haines 2.9); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126–27. going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.6–12 (\n Haines 2.11–19); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126–27. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. \"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\" he wrote back.De Feriis Alsiensibus 4, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: \"'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \"—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 4 (= Haines 2.19), qtd. and tr.

Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes,De bello Parthico 1–2 (\n Haines 2.21–23). but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \"always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\".De bello Parthico 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127.\n\nLucius at Antioch, 162–165\n\nOver the winter of 161–162, as more bad news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.Dio 71.1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.HA Verus 5.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, 125. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".HA Marcus 8.9, tr.

Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163.

A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, Gaius Julius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 280 n. 42; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff.\n\nIn 163, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on Edessa, and installed their own king on its throne.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, 279 n. 38; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169; Millar, Near East, 112.

Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 15, 19; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 20, 28; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Syme, Roman Papers, 5.689ff.\n\nBy the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.HA Verus 8.3–4; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), 124ff., on the date.\n\nCassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again, earning the title 'imp. III'.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing H.

Kneissl, Die Siegestitulatur der römischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts (Göttingen, 1969), 99 ff. and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores, becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.\n\nConclusion of the war and events at Rome, mid-160s–167\n\nMost of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals, the most prominent of which was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was a young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ab epistulis, followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, passim; Syme, Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia 1984 (= Roman Papers IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?). Cassius and his fellow commander in the war, Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing Alföldy, Konsulat, 24, 221.\n\nAt Rome, Marcus was occupied with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. However, her will was invalid under the lex Falcidia: Matidia had assigned more than three-quarters of her estate to non-relatives. This was because many of her clients were included in codicils to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but as she was dying, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case, but Marcus demurred, saying his brother would make the final decision.Ad Antoninum Imperator 2.1–2 (= Haines 2.94ff.); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132.\n\nOn the return from the campaign, Lucius was awarded with a triumph; the parade was unusual because it included the two emperors, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, Commodus, five years old, and Annius Verus, three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion.\n\nThe returning army carried with them a plague, afterwards known as the Antonine Plague, or the Plague of Galen, which spread through the Roman Empire between 165 and 180. The disease was a pandemic believed to be either of smallpox or measles, and may have claimed the lives of two Roman emperors—Lucius Verus, who died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius,Birley, 210 whose family name, Antoninus, was given to the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius, and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day at Rome, one-quarter of those infected. Total deaths have been estimated at five million.\n\nA possible contact with Han China occurred in 166 when a Roman traveller visited the Han court, claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun (Chinese: 安 敦), ruler of Daqin, who can be identified either with Marcus Aurelius or his predecessor Antoninus Pius.Yü, Ying-shih. (1986). \"Han Foreign Relations,\" in Denis Twitchett and Michael Loewe (eds), The Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. – A.D. 220, 377-462, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 460–61, .de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23–220 AD), Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 600, .

Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus Pius and perhaps even Marcus Aurelius have been found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, then part of the Kingdom of Funan near the Chinese province of Jiaozhi (in northern Vietnam). This may have been the port city of Kattigara, described by Ptolemy (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and laying beyond the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula).Gary K.

Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius to Aurelian have been found in Xi'an, China (site of the Han capital Chang'an), although the far greater amount of Roman coins in India suggests the Roman maritime trade for purchasing Chinese silk was centered there, not in China or even the overland Silk Road running through Persia.Warwick Ball (2016), Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire, 2nd edition, London & New York: Routledge, , p. 154.\n\nLegal and administrative work, 161–180\n\nLike many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes;Fergus Millar, The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC – AD 337 (London: Duckworth, 1977), 6 and passim. See also: idem. \"Emperors at Work\", Journal of Roman Studies 57:1/2 (1967): 9–19. but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.\"Pius, one of longest-serving emperors, became infirm in his last years, so Marcus Aurelius gradually assumed the imperial duties. By the time he succeeded in AD 161, he was already well-practised in public administration.\"  This quote is from philosopher Iain King, writing about Aurelius in [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm  Thinkers At War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.  Marcus took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him \"an emperor most skilled in the law\"Codex Justinianus 7.2.6, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133. and \"a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor\".Digest 31.67.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133. He shows marked interest in three areas of the law: the manumission of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (decuriones).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133.\nIn 168 he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity from 79% to 82%—the actual silver weight increasing from 2.57 grams to 2.67 grams. However, two years later Marcus reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire.\n\nWar with Germanic tribes 166–180\n\nDuring the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome).Dio 72.11.3–4; Ad amicos 1.12 (Haines 2.173); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132. The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes.Dio 72.11.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132, citing De nepote amisso 2 (\n Haines 2.222); Ad Verum Imperator 2.9–10 (= Haines 2.232ff.).\n\nExperienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133, citing Geza Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand (1977), Moesia Inferior: 232 f.; Moesia Superior: 234f.; Pannonia Superior: 236f.; Dacia: 245f.; Pannonia Inferior: 251.\n\nStarting in the 160s, Germanic tribes and other nomadic people launched raids along the northern border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion of the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162.\n\nFar more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the Marcomanni of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since year 19, crossed the Danube together with the Lombards and other Germanic tribes. Soon thereafter, the Iranian Sarmatians attacked between the Danube and the Theiss rivers.\n\nDue to the situation in the East, only a punitive expedition could be launched in 167. Both Marcus and Verus led the troops. After the death of Verus (169), Marcus personally led the struggle against the Germanic tribes for most of his remaining life. The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the Quadi and Marcomanni, who would cross the Alps, ravage Opitergium (Oderzo) and besiege Aquileia, the main Roman city of north-east Italy.\n\nAt the same time the Costoboci, coming from the Carpathian area, invaded Moesia, Macedonia and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Some Germanic tribes who settled in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius\n\nThe emperor's plans were prevented by an usurpation in 175 of the governor of Syria, Avidius Cassius, which was prompted by false news of the death of Marcus after an illness. The rebellion quickly gathered support in the Eastern provinces, only Cappadocia and Bithynia did not side with the rebels. When it became clear that Marcus Aurelius was still alive, Cassius' fortunes declined quickly and he was killed by his troops after only 100 days of power.\n\nTogether with his wife Faustina, Marcus Aurelius toured the eastern provinces until 173. He visited Athens, declaring himself a protector of philosophy. After a triumph in Rome, the following year he marched again to the Danubian frontier. After a decisive victory in 178, the plan to annex Moravia and West Slovakia  seemed poised for success but was abandoned after Marcus Aurelius again fell ill in 180.\n\nDeath and succession 180\n\nMarcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern Vienna). He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to Rome, and rested in Hadrian's mausoleum (modern Castel Sant'Angelo) until the Visigoth sack of the city in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a column and a temple built in Rome.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Commodus, whom he had named Caesar in 166 and with whom he had jointly ruled since 177.  It was only the second time that a \"non-adoptive\" son was chosen as heir to the throne.  The only other having been a century earlier when Vespasian was succeeded by his son Titus. Historians have criticized the decision, citing Commodus' erratic behavior and lack of political and military acumen. At the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an encomium to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus in his own lifetime with sorrow:\n\n...[Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.\n–Cassius Dio 71.36.3–4Tr. Cary, ad loc.\n\nMichael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus:\n\nThe youth turned out to be very erratic, or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions.\n\nLegacy and reputation\n\nMarcus Aurelius acquired the reputation of a philosopher king within his lifetime, and the title would remain his after death; both Dio and the biographer call him \"the philosopher\".HA Marcus 1.1, 27.7; Dio 71.1.1; James Francis, Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 21 n. 1. Christians such as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras and Melito gave him the title, too.Francis, 21 n.1, citing Justin, 1 Apologia 1; Athenagoras, Leg. 1; Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 4.26.9–11. The last named went so far as to call Marcus Aurelius \"more philanthropic and philosophic\" than Antoninus Pius and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 4.26.9–11, qtd. and tr. Francis, 21 n. 1. \"Alone of the emperors,\" wrote the historian Herodian, \"he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.\"Herodian, Ab Excessu Divi Marci 1.2.4, tr. Echols.\n\nIain King concludes Marcus Aurelius' legacy is tragic, because the emperor's \"Stoic philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others—was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death\".This is the conclusion of King's biography of Aurelius, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm Thinker at War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.\n\nIn the 1964 movie The Fall of the Roman Empire he was portrayed by Alec Guinness  and in the 2000 movie Gladiator by Richard Harris.  Both movie plots posited that Marcus Aurelius was assassinated because he intended to pass down power to his adopted son, a Roman general, instead of his biological son, Commodus.\n\nAttitude towards Christians\n\nIn the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was local Roman officials who were largely responsible for the persecution of Christians. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.Timothy D. Barnes, \"Legislation Against the Christians,\" Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 58 (1968) The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians. \n\nAccording to Gibbon, with the onset of the Germanic war, his treatment of the Christians degraded with increased persecutions uncharacteristic of the previous years of his reign and those of his predecessors. \n\nMarriage and children\n\nAurelius married his first cousin Faustina the Younger in 145. During their 30-year marriage, Faustina bore 13 children. Only one son and four daughters outlived their father:\n# Annia Aurelia Galeria Faustina (147–after 165)\n# Gemellus Lucillae (died around 150), twin brother of Lucilla\n# Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (148/150–182), twin sister of Gemellus, married her father's co-ruler Lucius Verus\n# Titus Aelius Antoninus (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Titus Aelius Aurelius (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Hadrianus (152–157)\n# Domitia Faustina (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Annia Aurelia Fadilla (159–after 211)\n# Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor (160–after 211)\n# Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (161–165), twin brother of Commodus\n# Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus (Commodus) (161–192), twin brother of Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, later emperor\n# Marcus Annius Verus Caesar (162–169)\n# Vibia Aurelia Sabina (170–died before 217)\n\nWritings\n\nWhile on campaign between 170 and 180, Aurelius wrote his Meditations in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown.  \"Meditations\" as well as others, including \"To Himself\" were adopted later.  He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. The book was a favourite of Frederick the Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and Goethe.  Modern figures such as Wen Jiabao, Bill Clinton,Gregory Hays. Introduction to Marcus Aurelius Meditations Weidenfeld and Nicholson London2003 pxlix and James Mattis are admirers of the book.\n\nIt is not known how far Marcus' writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and Julian the Apostate was well aware of Marcus' reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention the Meditations.Stertz, 434, citing Themistius, Oratio 6.81; HA Cassius 3.5; Aurelius Victor, De Caesaribus 16.9.  It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church and the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known reference of it by name (\"Marcus' writings to himself\") are from Arethas of Caesarea in the 10th century and in the Byzantine Suda (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself).  It was first published in 1558 in Zurich by Wilhelm Xylander (ne Holzmann), from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards.Gregory Hays.

James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32) 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD) was Roman emperor from , ruling jointly with Lucius Verus until Verus' death in 169 and jointly with his son, Commodus, from 177. He was the last of the so-called Five Good Emperors.\n\nHe was a practitioner of Stoicism, and his untitled writing, commonly known as Meditations, is a significant source of our modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. It is considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy. \n\nDuring his reign, the Roman Empire defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in the East: Aurelius' general Avidius Cassius sacked the capital Ctesiphon in 164. In central Europe, Aurelius fought the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, although the threat of the Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. A revolt in the East led by Avidius Cassius failed to gain momentum and was suppressed immediately. Persecution of Christians increased during his reign.\n\nHis death in 180 is considered the end of the Pax Romana[https://books.google.it/books?idLkgrDwAAQBAJ&pg\nPT85&dqmarcus+aurelius+death+end+of+pax+romana&hl\nit&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwj7xK_Ki97WAhWGL8AKHfsOCVgQ6AEIPjAE#vonepage&q\nmarcus%20aurelius%20death%20end%20of%20pax%20romana&f=false] and the increasing instability in the west that followed has traditionally been seen as the beginning of the eventual Fall of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nSources\n\nThe major sources depicting the life and rule of Marcus Aurelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the Historia Augusta, claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century AD, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as \"the biographer\") from the later 4th century (c. 395 AD).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 229–30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's \"Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der Scriptoes Historiae Augustae\" (in German), Hermes 24 (1889), 337ff.\n\nThe later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources (Marius Maximus or Ignotus), are much more accurate. For Marcus' life and rule, the biographies of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are full of fiction.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 230. On the HA Verus, see Barnes, 65–74.\n\nA body of correspondence between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.Mary Beard, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n14/bear01_.html Was He Quite Ordinary?]\", London Review of Books 31:14 (23 July 2009), accessed 15 September 2009; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 226. Marcus' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 227. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 228–29, 253.\n\nSome other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 227–28. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 228.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nMarcus' family originated in Ucubi, a small town southeast of Córdoba in Iberian Baetica. The family rose to prominence in the late 1st century AD. Marcus' great-grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (I) was a senator and (according to the Historia Augusta) ex-praetor; in 73–74, his grandfather, Marcus Annius Verus (II), was made a patrician.HA Marcus 1.2, 1.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 28; McLynn, 14. Verus' elder son—Marcus Aurelius' father—Marcus Annius Verus (III) married Domitia Lucilla.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 29; McLynn, 14. \n\nLucilla was the daughter of the patrician P. Calvisius Tullus Ruso and the elder Domitia Lucilla. The elder Domitia Lucilla had inherited a great fortune (described at length in one of Pliny's letters) from her maternal grandfather and her paternal grandfather by adoption.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 29, citing Pliny, Epistulae 8.18. The younger Lucilla would acquire much of her mother's wealth, including a large brickworks on the outskirts of Rome—a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 30.\n\nLucilla and Verus (III) had two children: a son, Marcus, born on 26 April 121 AD, and a daughter, Annia Cornificia Faustina, probably born in 122 or 123 AD.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31, 44. Verus (III) probably died in 124 AD, during his praetorship, when Marcus was only three years old.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31. Though he can hardly have known him, Marcus Aurelius wrote in his Meditations that he had learned \"modesty and manliness\" from his memories of his father and from the man's posthumous reputation.Meditations 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31. Lucilla did not remarry.\n\nLucilla, following prevailing aristocratic customs, probably did not spend much time with her son. Marcus was in the care of \"nurses\".HA Marcus 2.1 and Meditations 5.4, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 32. Even so, Marcus credits his mother with teaching him \"religious piety, simplicity in diet\" and how to avoid \"the ways of the rich\".Meditations 1.3, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. In his letters, Marcus makes frequent and affectionate reference to her; he was grateful that, \"although she was fated to die young, yet she spent her last years with me\".Meditations 1.17.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35.\n\nAfter his father's death, Aurelius was raised by his paternal grandfather Marcus Annius Verus who, according to Roman Law, had always retained the \"patria potestas\" over his son and grandson. Technically this was not an adoption, since an adoption would be the legal creation of a new and different \"patria potestas\" (II).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 33. Another man, Lucius Catilius Severus, also participated in his upbringing. Severus is described as Marcus' \"maternal great-grandfather\"; he is probably the stepfather of the elder Lucilla. Marcus was raised in his parents' home on the Caelian Hill, a district he would affectionately refer to as \"my Caelian\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 2.8.2 (= Haines 1.142), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31.\n\nIt was an upscale region, with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas. Marcus' grandfather owned his own palace beside the Lateran, where Marcus would spend much of his childhood.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31–32. Marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him \"good character and avoidance of bad temper\".Meditations 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. He was less fond of the mistress his grandfather took and lived with after the death of Rupilia Faustina, his wife.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35. Marcus was grateful that he did not have to live with her longer than he did.Meditations 1.17.2; Farquharson, 1.102; McLynn, 23; cf. Meditations 1.17.11; Farquharson, 1.103.\n\nMarcus was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends;McLynn, 20–21. Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools.Meditations 1.4; McLynn, 20. One of his teachers, Diognetus, a painting-master, proved particularly influential; he seems to have introduced Marcus to the philosophic way of life.HA Marcus 2.2, 4.9; Meditations 1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 37; McLynn, 21–22. In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough Greek cloak, and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.HA Marcus 2.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 38; McLynn, 21.\n\nA new set of tutors—Alexander of Cotiaeum, Trosius Aper and Tuticius Proculus—took over Marcus' education in about 132 or 133.HA Marcus 2.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40, 270 n.27. Little is known of the latter two (both teachers of Latin), but Alexander was a major littérateur, the leading Homeric scholar of his day.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40, citing Aelius Aristides, Oratio 32 K; McLynn, 21. Marcus thanks Alexander for his training in literary styling.Meditations 1.10; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 40; McLynn, 22. Alexander's influence—an emphasis on matter over style, on careful wording, with the occasional Homeric quotation—has been detected in Marcus' Meditations.Birley,  Marcus Aurelius, 40, 270 n.28, citing A.S.L. Farquharson, The Meditations of Marcus Antoninus (Oxford, 1944) 2.453.\n\nSuccession to Hadrian, 136–138\n\nIn late 136, Hadrian almost died from a haemorrhage. Convalescent in his villa at Tivoli, he selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus, Marcus' intended father-in-law, as his successor and adopted him as his son.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 41–42. The selection was done invitis omnibus, \"against the wishes of everyone\".HA Hadrian 23.10, qtd. in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 42. While there will never be absolute certainty regarding his motives, it would appear that his goal was to eventually place the then-too-young Marcus on the throne.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 42. A Companion to Marcus Aurelius, ch. 8, p. 142. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, \"Hadrian and Lucius Verus\", Journal of Roman Studies 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, \"Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo\", Phoenix 49:4 (1995): 319–30. As part of his adoption, Commodus took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar. His health was so poor that during a ceremony to mark his becoming heir to the throne, he was too weak to lift a large shield on his own.HA Aelius 6.2-3 After a brief stationing on the Danube frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage later in the day.HA Hadrian 23.15–16; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 45; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 148. \n\nOn 24 January 138 AD, Hadrian selected Aurelius Antoninus, the husband of Marcus' aunt Faustina the Elder as his new successor.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 46. Date: Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 148.  After a few days' consideration, Antoninus accepted. He was adopted on 25 February. As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus adopted Marcus and Lucius Verus, the son of  Lucius Aelius. By this scheme,  Lucius Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his new father.\n\nMarcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus; Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At Hadrian's request, Antoninus' daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.Dio 69.21.1; HA Hadrian 24.1; HA Aelius 6.9; HA Antoninus Pius 4.6–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 48–49. He reportedly greeted the news that Hadrian had become his adoptive grandfather with sadness, instead of joy. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.HA Marcus 5.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 49.\n\nAt some time in 138 AD, Hadrian requested in the senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming quaestor before his twenty-fourth birthday. The senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, consul for 139.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 49–50. Marcus' adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. If not for his adoption, he probably would have become triumvir monetalis, a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as tribune with a legion, becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: \"He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household.\"HA Marcus 5.6–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 50.\n\nAfter a series of suicide attempts, all thwarted by Antoninus, Hadrian left for Baiae, a seaside resort on the Campanian coast. His condition did not improve, and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors, indulging himself in food and drink. He sent for Antoninus, who was at his side when he died on 10 July 138.Dio 69.22.4; HA Hadrian 25.5–6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 50–51. Hadrian's suicide attempts: Dio 69.22.1–4; HA Hadrian 24.8–13. His remains were buried quietly at Puteoli.HA Hadrian 25.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 53. The succession to Antoninus was peaceful and stable: Antoninus kept Hadrian's nominees in office and appeased the senate, respecting its privileges and commuting the death sentences of men charged in Hadrian's last days.HA Antoninus Pius 5.3, 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 55–56; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 151. For his dutiful behavior, Antoninus was asked to accept the name \"Pius\".Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 55; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 151.\n\nHeir to Antoninus Pius, 138–145\n\nImmediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.HA Marcus 6.2; Verus 2.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 53–54.\n\nAntoninus bolstered Marcus' dignity: Marcus was made consul for 140 AD, with Antoninus as his colleague, and was appointed as a seviri, one of the knights' six commanders, at the order's annual parade on 15 July 139 AD. As the heir apparent, Marcus became princeps iuventutis, head of the equestrian order. He now took the name Caesar: Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar.Dio 71.35.5; HA Marcus 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 56. Marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously: \"See that you do not turn into a Caesar; do not be dipped into the purple dye—for that can happen\".Meditations 6.30, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57; cf. Marcus Aurelius, 270 n.9, with notes on the translation. At the senate's request, Marcus joined all the priestly colleges (pontifices, augures, quindecimviri sacris faciundis, septemviri epulonum, etc.);HA Marcus 6.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57. direct evidence for membership, however, is available only for the Arval Brethren.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57, 272 n.10, citing Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224044/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nCIL+06,+00032&r_sortierungBelegstelle 6.32], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224054/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nCIL+06,+00379&r_sortierungBelegstelle 6.379], cf. Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224059/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nD+00360&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 360].\n\nAntoninus demanded that Marcus take up residence in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Antoninus also made him take up the habits of his new station, the aulicum fastigium or \"pomp of the court\", against Marcus' objections. Marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings. He told himself it was an attainable goal—\"where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace\"Meditations 5.16, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57.—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the Meditations for \"abusing court life\" in front of company.Meditations 8.9, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57.\n\nAs quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do. He would read imperial letters to the senate when Antoninus was absent, and would do secretarial work for the senators. His duties as consul were more significant: one of two senior representatives of the senate, he would preside over meetings and take a major role in the body's administrative functions.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 57–58. He felt drowned in paperwork, and complained to his tutor, Fronto: \"I am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 90. He was being \"fitted for ruling the state\", in the words of his biographer.HA Marcus 6.5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 58. He was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well, making oratorical training essential for the job.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89.\n\nOn 1 January 145 AD, Marcus was made consul a second time. He might have been unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto that might have been sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep \"so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 5.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89. Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: \"As far as my strength is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89. Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.Dio 71.36.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89.\n\nIn April 145 AD, Marcus married Faustina, as had been planned since 138 AD. Since Marcus was, by adoption, Antoninus Pius' son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his patria potestas) for the ceremony to take place.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 90–91. Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been \"noteworthy\".HA Antoninus Pius 10.2, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 91. Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as Pontifex Maximus, would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina.Birley, Marcus Unko Aurelius, 91.\n\nFronto and further education, 136–161\n\nAfter taking the toga virilis in 136 AD, Marcus probably began his training in oratory.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 61. He had three tutors in Greek, Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and Herodes Atticus, and one in Latin, Fronto. The latter two were the most esteemed orators of the day.HA Marcus 3.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 62. (Fronto and Atticus, however, probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by Antoninus in 138 AD.) The preponderance of Greek tutors indicates the importance of the Greek language to the aristocracy of Rome.HA Marcus 2.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 62. This was the age of the Second Sophistic, a renaissance in Greek letters. Although educated in Rome, in his Meditations, Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's Marcus Aurelius, Classical Review 17:3 (1967): 347.\n\nHerodes Atticus was controversial: an enormously rich Athenian (probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger, and resented by his fellow-Athenians for his patronizing manner.Vita Sophistae 2.1.14; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 63–64. Atticus was an inveterate opponent of Stoicism and philosophic pretensions.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 9.2.1–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 64–65. He thought the Stoics' desire for a \"lack of feeling\" foolish: they would live a \"sluggish, enervated life\", he said.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 19.12, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65. Marcus would become a Stoic. He would not mention Herodes at all in his Meditations, in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65.\n\nFronto was highly esteemed: in the self-consciously antiquarian world of Latin letters,Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 67–68, citing Edward Champlin, Fronto and Antonine Rome (1980), esp. chs. 3 and 4. he was thought of as second only to Cicero, perhaps even an alternative to him.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 65–67. He did not care much for Herodes, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure synonyms, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.\n\nA significant amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69. The pair were very close. \"Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are not here.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.6 (\n Haines 1.80ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 76. Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.6 (= Haines 1.80ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 76–77.\n\nHe wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn \"from the lips of Fronto\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.10–11 (Haines 1.50ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 73. His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always sufferingBirley, Marcus Aurelius, 73.—about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses.Champlin, \"Chronology of Fronto\", 138. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, \"of my own accord with every kind of discomfort\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 5.74 ( \nHaines 2.52ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 73.\n\nFronto never became Marcus' full-time teacher, and continued his career as an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 77. On the date, see Champlin, \"Chronology of Fronto\", 142, who (with Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire (1964), 93ff) argues for a date in the 150s; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 78–79, 273 n.17 (with Ameling, Herodes Atticus (1983), 1.61ff, 2.30ff) argues for 140. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with \"advice\", then as a \"favor\", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows.Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.2 (Haines 1.58ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 77–78. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), allowed that Marcus might be correct,Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.3 (\n Haines 1.62ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 78. but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary: \"...the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 3.3 (= Haines 1.62ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 79. The outcome of the trial is unknown.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 80.\n\nBy the age of twenty-five (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in jurisprudence, and showed some signs of general malaise. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an unpleasant blowhard, and had made \"a hit at\" him: \"It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to be a judge is noble work.\"Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.13 (Haines 1.214ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 93. Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.3.1 (\n Haines 1.2ff); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94. In any case, Marcus' formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. It \"affected his health adversely\", his biographer writes, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. It was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in Marcus' entire boyhood.HA Marcus 3.5–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94.\n\nFronto had warned Marcus against the study of philosophy early on: \"it is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy...than to have tasted it superficially, with the edge of the lips, as the saying is\".Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.3, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69. He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle. Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' \"conversion to philosophy\": \"in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work\", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training.De Eloquentia 4.5 (\n Haines 2.74), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95. Alan Cameron, in his review of Birley's biography (The Classical Review 17:3 (1967): 347), suggests a reference to chapter 11 of Arthur Darby Nock's Conversion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933, rept. 1961): \"Conversion to Philosophy\". Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94, 105.\n\nApollonius may have introduced Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but Quintus Junius Rusticus would have the strongest influence on the boy.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95; Champlin, Fronto, 120. He was the man Fronto recognized as having \"wooed Marcus away\" from oratory.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.36), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 95. He was twenty years older than Marcus, older than Fronto. As the grandson of Arulenus Rusticus, one of the martyrs to the tyranny of Domitian (r. 81–96), he was heir to the tradition of \"Stoic Opposition\" to the \"bad emperors\" of the 1st century;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94–95, 101. the true successor of Seneca (as opposed to Fronto, the false one).Champlin, Fronto, 120. Marcus thanks Rusticus for teaching him \"not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts...To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing'\".Meditations 1.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 94–95.\n\nBirths and deaths, 147–160\n\nOn November 30, 147, Faustina gave birth to a girl, named Domitia Faustina. She was the first of at least thirteen children (including two sets of twins) that Faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Antoninus Pius gave Marcus the tribunician power and the imperium—authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, Marcus had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four Antoninus could introduce. His tribunican powers would be renewed, with Antoninus', on 10 December 147.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103.\n\nThe first mention of Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals her as a sickly infant. \"Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery. The diarrhea has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing.\" He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been \"pretty occupied\" with the girl's care.Ad Marcum Caesarem 4.11 (= Haines 1.202ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 105. Domitia would die in 151.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 247 F.1.\n\nIn 149, Faustina gave birth again, to twin sons. Contemporary coinage commemorates the event, with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys, and the legend temporum felicitas, \"the happiness of the times\". They did not survive long. Before the end of the year, another family coin was issued: it shows only a tiny girl, Domitia Faustina, and one boy baby. Then another: the girl alone. The infants were buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian, where their epitaphs survive. They were called Titus Aurelius Antoninus and Tiberius Aelius Aurelius.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 206–07.\n\nMarcus steadied himself: \"One man prays: 'How I may not lose my little child', but you must pray: 'How I may not be afraid to lose him'.\"Meditations 9.40, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 207. He quoted from the Iliad what he called the \"briefest and most familiar saying...enough to dispel sorrow and fear\":                                                        leaves,\nthe wind scatters some on the face of the ground;\nlike unto them are the children of men.\n– Iliad 6.146Meditations 10.34, tr. Farquharson, 78, 224.Another daughter was born on 7 March 150, Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla. At some time between 155 and 161, probably soon after 155, Marcus' mother, Domitia Lucilla, died.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107. Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, might not have been born until 153.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107–08. Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152. A coin issue celebrates fecunditati Augustae, \"the Augusta's fertility\", depicting two girls and an infant. The boy did not survive long; on coins from 156, only the two girls were depicted. He might have died in 152, the same year as Marcus' sister, Cornificia.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108.\n\nBy 28 March 158, however, when Marcus replied, the child was dead, Marcus thanked the temple synod, \"even though this turned out otherwise\". The child's name is unknown.Inscriptiones Graecae ad Res Romanas pertinentes 4.1399, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. In 159 and 160, Faustina gave birth to daughters: Fadilla, after one of Faustina's dead sisters, and Cornificia, after Marcus' dead sister.Birley, 114.\n\nAntoninus Pius' last years, 152–161\n\nMeanwhile, during the reign of his adoptive father, Antoninus, as a prince and future emperor, Marcus' adoptive brother Lucius Verus received careful education from the famous “grammaticus” Marcus Cornelius Fronto. The young Verus was reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Lucius started his political career as a quaestor in 153, two years before the legal age of 25 (Marcus held the office at 17). In 154, he was consul, nine years before the legal age of 32 (Marcus held the office at 18 and 23), and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.\n\nLucius had no other titles, except that of \"son of Augustus\". Lucius had a markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds, but especially hunting and wrestling; he took obvious pleasure in the circus games and gladiatorial fights.HA Verus 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108. He did not marry until 164.HA Verus 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Barnes, 68; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 108.\n\nIn 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still when he became the praetorian prefect (an office that was as much secretarial as military) as Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 112. In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.\n\nTwo days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at Lorium, in Etruria,Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7 about 19 kilometres (12 mi) from Rome.Victor, 15:7 He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,Dio 71.33.4–5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password—\"aequanimitas\" (equanimity).Bury, pg. 532 He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.HA Antoninus Pius 12.4–8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114. His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus, surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months.Bowman, pg. 156\n\nEmperor\n\nAccession of Marcus and Lucius, 161\n\nAfter the death of Antoninus Pius, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow. The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title imperator, and he would soon be formally elected as Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was \"compelled\" to take imperial power.HA Marcus 7.5, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. This may have been a genuine horror imperii, \"fear of imperial power\". Marcus, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear. It was his duty.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. Birley takes the phrase horror imperii from HA Pert. 13.1 and 15.8.\n\nAlthough Marcus showed no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his Meditations), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 156. Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.HA Verus 3.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 156. The senate accepted, granting Lucius the imperium, the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.HA Verus 4.1; Marcus 7.5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 116–17. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.\n\nIn spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more auctoritas, or \"authority\", than Lucius. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Antoninus' administration, and he alone was Pontifex Maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, \"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.\"HA Verus 4.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117, 278 n.4.\n\nImmediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative.HA Marcus 7.9; Verus 4.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117–18. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, with more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.HA Marcus 7.9; Verus 4.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117–18. \"twice the size\": Richard Duncan-Jones, Structure and Scale in the Roman Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 109. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118.\n\nUpon his accession he also devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 83.5% to 79%—the silver weight dropping from 2.68 grams to 2.57 grams. However, Marcus would later revisit the issue of currency reform.\n\nAntoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, \"elaborate\".HA Marcus 7.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118, 278 n.6. If his funeral followed those of his predecessors, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, and his spirit would have been seen as ascending to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now Divus Antoninus. Antoninus Pius' remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself.HA Marcus 7.10–11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118. The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.\n\nIn accordance with his will, Antoninus' fortune passed on to Faustina.HA Antoninus Pius 12.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118–19. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.HA Marcus 7.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other.HA Comm. 1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus.HA Comm. 1.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. Aside from the fact that the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children.HA Comm. 1.4, 10.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 155ff.; 949ff.\n\nEarly rule, 161–162\n\nSoon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).HA Marcus 7.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118. At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118, citing Werner Eck, Die Organization Italiens (1979), 146ff. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, \"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\"HA Marcus 8.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 157.\n\nMarcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ab epistulis Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of Pannonia and had served in the war in Mauretania. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 122–23, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain I–III (Paris, 1960–61); Supplément (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, Roman Britain and the Roman Army (1953), 142ff., 151ff. Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus' former tutor, had been prefectural governor of Egypt at Marcus' accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (aerarium Saturni). He was made consul soon after.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain I–III (Paris, 1960–61); Supplément (Paris, 1982), no. 141. Fronto's son-in-law, Aufidius Victorinus, was appointed governor of Upper Germany.HA Marcus 8.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing W. Eck, Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen (1985), 65ff.\n\nFronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator 1.3.2 (Haines 1.298ff). The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\"Ad Antoninum Imperator 4.2.3 (\n Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 119. Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120.\n\nLucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator 1.1 (Haines 1.305). Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for \"some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus—or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.\"Ad Antoninum Imperator 4.1 (\n Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120.\n\nMarcus' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.HA Marcus 8.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120. Soon, however, Marcus would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the felicitas temporum (\"happy times\") that the coinage of 161 had so glibly proclaimed.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845.\n\nIn the spring of 162, the Tiber overflowed its banks, flooding much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.HA Marcus 8.4–5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.HA Marcus 11.3, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 278 n.16.\n\nFronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was \"beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence\".Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128. Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: \"Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape.\"De eloquentia 1.12 (\n Haines 2.63–65), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128.\n\nThe early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.2 (Haines 2.35); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127–28. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: \"not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech\". Fronto was hugely pleased.Ad Antoninum Imperator 1.2.4 (\n Haines 2.41–43), tr. Haines; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 128.\n\nWar with Parthia, 161–166\n\nOrigins to Lucius' dispatch, 161–162\n\nOn his deathbed, Antoninus Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.HA Antoninus Pius 12.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114, 121. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.Event: HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. Date: Jaap-Jan Flinterman, \"The Date of Lucian's Visit to Abonuteichos,\" Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 119 (1997): 281. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121.\n\nConvinced by the prophet Alexander of Abonutichus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself,Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121–22. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241–50. Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX HispanaBirley, Marcus Aurelius, 278 n.19.) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 21, 24, 25; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121–22.\n\nThere was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes.HA Marcus 8.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 122. Marcus was unprepared. Antoninus seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Antoninus' twenty-three-year reign at his emperor's side—and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.HA Antoninus Pius 7.11; Marcus 7.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103–04, 122.\n\nMore bad news arrived: the Syrian governor's army had been defeated by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223837/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelleCIL+08,+07050&r_sortierung\nBelegstelle 8.7050]–[https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223843/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelleCIL+08,+07051&r_sortierung\nBelegstelle 51]; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123.

Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.HA Verus 9.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125.\n\nMarcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the coast of Etruria. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.De Feriis Alsiensibus 1 (Haines 2.3); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. Fronto replied ironically: \"What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking, and complete leisure for four whole days?\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.1 (\n Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Antoninus had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy),De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.4 (Haines 2.9); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126–27. going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.6–12 (\n Haines 2.11–19); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126–27. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. \"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\" he wrote back.De Feriis Alsiensibus 4, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: \"'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \"—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 4 (= Haines 2.19), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127.\n\nFronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material,De bello Parthico 10 (Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes,De bello Parthico 1–2 (\n Haines 2.21–23). but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \"always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\".De bello Parthico 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127.\n\nLucius at Antioch, 162–165\n\nOver the winter of 161–162, as more bad news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.Dio 71.1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.HA Verus 5.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, 125. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".HA Marcus 8.9, tr.

On Lucius' voyage, see: HA Verus 6.7–9; HA Marcus 8.10–11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125–26.\n\nLucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Critics declaimed Lucius' luxurious lifestyle.HA Verus 4.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would \"dice the whole night through\".HA Verus 4.6, tr.

Marcus moved up the date; perhaps he had already heard of Lucius' mistress, the low-born and beautiful Panthea.HA Verus 7.10; Lucian, Imagines 3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Cf. Lucian, Imagines, Pro Imaginibus, passim. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father.HA Verus 7.7; Marcus 9.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131.

Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 233ff.\n\nOccupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), replaced Artaxata.Dio 71.3.1; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162; Millar, Near East, 113. A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, Gaius Julius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 280 n. 42; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff.\n\nIn 163, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on Edessa, and installed their own king on its throne.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, 279 n. 38; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169; Millar, Near East, 112. In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162. Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.Fronto, Ad Verum Imperator 2.1.3 (Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 162. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town southwest of Edessa.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223856/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle\nD+01098&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1098]; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130.\n\nIn 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 15, 19; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 20, 28; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163, citing Syme, Roman Papers, 5.689ff.\n\nBy the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.HA Verus 8.3–4; Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), 124ff., on the date.\n\nCassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again, earning the title 'imp. III'.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing H.

Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title 'Medicus',Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing P. Kneissl, Die Siegestitulatur der römischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts (Göttingen, 1969), 99 ff. and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores, becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.\n\nConclusion of the war and events at Rome, mid-160s–167\n\nMost of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals, the most prominent of which was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was a young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ab epistulis, followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, passim; Syme, Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia 1984 (= Roman Papers IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?). Cassius and his fellow commander in the war, Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.Birley, \"Hadrian to the Antonines\", 164, citing Alföldy, Konsulat, 24, 221.\n\nAt Rome, Marcus was occupied with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. However, her will was invalid under the lex Falcidia: Matidia had assigned more than three-quarters of her estate to non-relatives. This was because many of her clients were included in codicils to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but as she was dying, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case, but Marcus demurred, saying his brother would make the final decision.Ad Antoninum Imperator 2.1–2 (= Haines 2.94ff.); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132.\n\nOn the return from the campaign, Lucius was awarded with a triumph; the parade was unusual because it included the two emperors, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, Commodus, five years old, and Annius Verus, three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion.\n\nThe returning army carried with them a plague, afterwards known as the Antonine Plague, or the Plague of Galen, which spread through the Roman Empire between 165 and 180. The disease was a pandemic believed to be either of smallpox or measles, and may have claimed the lives of two Roman emperors—Lucius Verus, who died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius,Birley, 210 whose family name, Antoninus, was given to the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius, and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day at Rome, one-quarter of those infected. Total deaths have been estimated at five million.\n\nA possible contact with Han China occurred in 166 when a Roman traveller visited the Han court, claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun (Chinese: 安 敦), ruler of Daqin, who can be identified either with Marcus Aurelius or his predecessor Antoninus Pius.Yü, Ying-shih. (1986). \"Han Foreign Relations,\" in Denis Twitchett and Michael Loewe (eds), The Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. – A.D. 220, 377-462, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 460–61, .de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23–220 AD), Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 600, .

Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus Pius and perhaps even Marcus Aurelius have been found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, then part of the Kingdom of Funan near the Chinese province of Jiaozhi (in northern Vietnam). This may have been the port city of Kattigara, described by Ptolemy (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and laying beyond the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula).Gary K. Young (2001), Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy, 31 BC – AD 305, London & New York: Routledge, , pp. 29–30For further information on Oc Eo, see Milton Osborne (2006), The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future, Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin, revised edition, first published in 2000, , pp. 24–25. Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius to Aurelian have been found in Xi'an, China (site of the Han capital Chang'an), although the far greater amount of Roman coins in India suggests the Roman maritime trade for purchasing Chinese silk was centered there, not in China or even the overland Silk Road running through Persia.Warwick Ball (2016), Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire, 2nd edition, London & New York: Routledge, , p. 154.\n\nLegal and administrative work, 161–180\n\nLike many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes;Fergus Millar, The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC – AD 337 (London: Duckworth, 1977), 6 and passim. See also: idem. \"Emperors at Work\", Journal of Roman Studies 57:1/2 (1967): 9–19. but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.\"Pius, one of longest-serving emperors, became infirm in his last years, so Marcus Aurelius gradually assumed the imperial duties. By the time he succeeded in AD 161, he was already well-practised in public administration.\"  This quote is from philosopher Iain King, writing about Aurelius in [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm  Thinkers At War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.  Marcus took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him \"an emperor most skilled in the law\"Codex Justinianus 7.2.6, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133. and \"a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor\".Digest 31.67.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133. He shows marked interest in three areas of the law: the manumission of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (decuriones).Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133.\nIn 168 he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity from 79% to 82%—the actual silver weight increasing from 2.57 grams to 2.67 grams. However, two years later Marcus reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire.\n\nWar with Germanic tribes 166–180\n\nDuring the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome).Dio 72.11.3–4; Ad amicos 1.12 (Haines 2.173); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132. The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes.Dio 72.11.3–4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 132, citing De nepote amisso 2 (\n Haines 2.222); Ad Verum Imperator 2.9–10 (= Haines 2.232ff.).\n\nExperienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 133, citing Geza Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand (1977), Moesia Inferior: 232 f.; Moesia Superior: 234f.; Pannonia Superior: 236f.; Dacia: 245f.; Pannonia Inferior: 251.\n\nStarting in the 160s, Germanic tribes and other nomadic people launched raids along the northern border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion of the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162.\n\nFar more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the Marcomanni of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since year 19, crossed the Danube together with the Lombards and other Germanic tribes. Soon thereafter, the Iranian Sarmatians attacked between the Danube and the Theiss rivers.\n\nDue to the situation in the East, only a punitive expedition could be launched in 167. Both Marcus and Verus led the troops. After the death of Verus (169), Marcus personally led the struggle against the Germanic tribes for most of his remaining life. The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the Quadi and Marcomanni, who would cross the Alps, ravage Opitergium (Oderzo) and besiege Aquileia, the main Roman city of north-east Italy.\n\nAt the same time the Costoboci, coming from the Carpathian area, invaded Moesia, Macedonia and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Some Germanic tribes who settled in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius\n\nThe emperor's plans were prevented by an usurpation in 175 of the governor of Syria, Avidius Cassius, which was prompted by false news of the death of Marcus after an illness. The rebellion quickly gathered support in the Eastern provinces, only Cappadocia and Bithynia did not side with the rebels. When it became clear that Marcus Aurelius was still alive, Cassius' fortunes declined quickly and he was killed by his troops after only 100 days of power.\n\nTogether with his wife Faustina, Marcus Aurelius toured the eastern provinces until 173. He visited Athens, declaring himself a protector of philosophy. After a triumph in Rome, the following year he marched again to the Danubian frontier. After a decisive victory in 178, the plan to annex Moravia and West Slovakia  seemed poised for success but was abandoned after Marcus Aurelius again fell ill in 180.\n\nDeath and succession 180\n\nMarcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern Vienna). He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to Rome, and rested in Hadrian's mausoleum (modern Castel Sant'Angelo) until the Visigoth sack of the city in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a column and a temple built in Rome.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Commodus, whom he had named Caesar in 166 and with whom he had jointly ruled since 177.  It was only the second time that a \"non-adoptive\" son was chosen as heir to the throne.  The only other having been a century earlier when Vespasian was succeeded by his son Titus. Historians have criticized the decision, citing Commodus' erratic behavior and lack of political and military acumen. At the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an encomium to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus in his own lifetime with sorrow:\n\n...[Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.\n–Cassius Dio 71.36.3–4Tr. Cary, ad loc.\n\nMichael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus:\n\nThe youth turned out to be very erratic, or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions.\n\nLegacy and reputation\n\nMarcus Aurelius acquired the reputation of a philosopher king within his lifetime, and the title would remain his after death; both Dio and the biographer call him \"the philosopher\".HA Marcus 1.1, 27.7; Dio 71.1.1; James Francis, Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 21 n. 1. Christians such as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras and Melito gave him the title, too.Francis, 21 n.1, citing Justin, 1 Apologia 1; Athenagoras, Leg. 1; Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 4.26.9–11. The last named went so far as to call Marcus Aurelius \"more philanthropic and philosophic\" than Antoninus Pius and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 4.26.9–11, qtd. and tr. Francis, 21 n. 1. \"Alone of the emperors,\" wrote the historian Herodian, \"he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.\"Herodian, Ab Excessu Divi Marci 1.2.4, tr. Echols.\n\nIain King concludes Marcus Aurelius' legacy is tragic, because the emperor's \"Stoic philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others—was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death\".This is the conclusion of King's biography of Aurelius, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm Thinker at War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.\n\nIn the 1964 movie The Fall of the Roman Empire he was portrayed by Alec Guinness  and in the 2000 movie Gladiator by Richard Harris.  Both movie plots posited that Marcus Aurelius was assassinated because he intended to pass down power to his adopted son, a Roman general, instead of his biological son, Commodus.\n\nAttitude towards Christians\n\nIn the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was local Roman officials who were largely responsible for the persecution of Christians. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.Timothy D. Barnes, \"Legislation Against the Christians,\" Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 58 (1968) The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians. \n\nAccording to Gibbon, with the onset of the Germanic war, his treatment of the Christians degraded with increased persecutions uncharacteristic of the previous years of his reign and those of his predecessors. \n\nMarriage and children\n\nAurelius married his first cousin Faustina the Younger in 145. During their 30-year marriage, Faustina bore 13 children. Only one son and four daughters outlived their father:\n# Annia Aurelia Galeria Faustina (147–after 165)\n# Gemellus Lucillae (died around 150), twin brother of Lucilla\n# Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (148/150–182), twin sister of Gemellus, married her father's co-ruler Lucius Verus\n# Titus Aelius Antoninus (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Titus Aelius Aurelius (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Hadrianus (152–157)\n# Domitia Faustina (born after 150, died before 7 March 161)\n# Annia Aurelia Fadilla (159–after 211)\n# Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor (160–after 211)\n# Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (161–165), twin brother of Commodus\n# Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus (Commodus) (161–192), twin brother of Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, later emperor\n# Marcus Annius Verus Caesar (162–169)\n# Vibia Aurelia Sabina (170–died before 217)\n\nWritings\n\nWhile on campaign between 170 and 180, Aurelius wrote his Meditations in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown.  \"Meditations\" as well as others, including \"To Himself\" were adopted later.  He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. The book was a favourite of Frederick the Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and Goethe.  Modern figures such as Wen Jiabao, Bill Clinton,Gregory Hays. Introduction to Marcus Aurelius Meditations Weidenfeld and Nicholson London2003 pxlix and James Mattis are admirers of the book.\n\nIt is not known how far Marcus' writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and Julian the Apostate was well aware of Marcus' reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention the Meditations.Stertz, 434, citing Themistius, Oratio 6.81; HA Cassius 3.5; Aurelius Victor, De Caesaribus 16.9.  It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church and the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known reference of it by name (\"Marcus' writings to himself\") are from Arethas of Caesarea in the 10th century and in the Byzantine Suda (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself).  It was first published in 1558 in Zurich by Wilhelm Xylander (ne Holzmann), from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards.Gregory Hays. Introduction to Marcus Aurelius Meditations Weidenfeld and Nicholson London 2003 pp. xlviii–xlix.  The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy is in the Vatican library and dates to the 14th century.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nAll citations to the Historia Augusta are to individual biographies, and are marked with a \"HA\".
