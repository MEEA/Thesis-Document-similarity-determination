  "textBody" : "James Clavell (10 October 1921 Date of birth often given as 10 October 1924. – 6 September 1994), born Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, was an Australian-born British (and later naturalized American) novelist, screenwriter, director, and World War II veteran and prisoner of war. Clavell is best known as a writer for his The Asian Saga series of novels and their televised adaptations.  Clavell also authored screenplays, such as The Great Escape (1963) and To Sir, with Love (1967).  Clavell wrote science fiction as well, including an episode of the early sci-fi TV series Men Into Space in 1959, titled \"First Woman on the Moon\", as well as the film script for the original (1958) version of the sci-fi/horror classic The Fly, starring Vincent Price.\n\nEarly life and World War II\n\nBorn in Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell, a British Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia on secondment to the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 to 1922. Clavell was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School. During 1940, aged 19, Clavell joined the Royal Artillery, and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese. Wounded by machine gun fire, he was eventually captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java. Later he was transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore.\n\nClavell suffered greatly at the hands of his Japanese captors. According to the introduction to Clavell's novel King Rat (1962), over 90% of the prisoners who entered Changi never walked out.850 out of a total of 87,000 prisoners are known to have died at Changi, although many more died after being transferred out to other sites like the Burma Railway. Cf. http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j33/blackburn.htm.  Clavell was reportedly saved, along with an entire battalion, by an American prisoner of war who later became the model for \"The King\" in King Rat. By 1946, Clavell became a captain, but a motorcycle accident ended his military career. He enrolled with the University of Birmingham, where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951)..\n\nPeter Marlowe\n\nPeter Marlowe is a character of the Clavell novels King Rat and Noble House (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan's) in the novel Whirlwind (1986).  Featured most prominently in King Rat, Marlowe is an English prisoner of war in Changi prison during World War II. In Noble House, set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong.  Marlowe's ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels. The character Marlowe the novelist is an obvious reference to Clavell; in Noble House he is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalized, is based on real events (like those in King Rat). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, \"Perhaps I'm not there at all\", although in a later scene, he admits he was \"the hero, of course\".\n\nFilm industry\n\nDuring 1953, Clavell and his wife immigrated to the United States and settled in Hollywood. Clavell scripted the science-fiction horror movie The Fly (1958) and wrote a war movie, Five Gates To Hell (1959). Clavell was nominated for a Writers Guild Award for The Great Escape (1963). He also screenwrote, directed, and produced the box office success, To Sir, With Love (1967), featuring Sidney Poitier and based on E. R. Braithwaite's semi-autobiographical 1959 book.\n\nClavell's daughter Michaela appeared briefly as Penelope Smallbone,\n\nMovies\n\n* The Fly (1958) (writer)\n* Watusi (1959) (writer)\n* Five Gates to Hell (1959) (writer and director)\n* Walk Like a Dragon (1960) (writer and director)\n* The Great Escape (1963) (co-writer)\n* 633 Squadron (1964) (co-writer)\n* The Satan Bug (1965) (co-writer)\n* King Rat (1965) (based on his novel)\n* To Sir, with Love (1966) (writer and director)\n* The Sweet and the Bitter (1967) (writer and director)\n* Where's Jack?

When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, Tai-Pan (1966), was a fictional account of Jardine Matheson's successful career in Hong Kong, as told via the character who was to become Clavell's heroic archetype, Dirk Struan. Struan's descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. Tai-Pan was adapted as a movie during 1986.\n\nClavell's third novel, Shōgun (1975), is set during 17th century Japan and relates the story of an English navigator, based on that of William Adams. When the story was made into a TV mini-series during 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second highest rated mini-series in history with an audience of more than 120 million.\n\nClavell's fourth novel, Noble House (1981), became a best-seller that year and was made into a 1988 miniseries.\n\nAfter the success of Noble House, Clavell wrote The Children's Story (1981) (an adaptation of his 1964 story), Thrump-o-moto (1985), Whirlwind (1986), and Gai-Jin (1993).\n\nNovels\n\nThe Asian Saga consists of seven novels:\n# King Rat (1962): Set in a Japanese POW camp in Singapore, 1945.\n# Tai-Pan (1966): Set in Hong Kong, 1841.\n# Shōgun (1975): Set in feudal Japan, 1600.\n# Noble House (1981): Set in Hong Kong, 1963.\n# Whirlwind (1986): Set in Iran, 1979.\n# Gai-Jin (1993): Set in Japan, 1862.\n# Escape: The Love Story from Whirlwind (1994), short novel adapted from Whirlwind (1986).\n\nChildren's stories\n\n* \"The Children's Story\" (1964 Readers Digest short story; adapted as a movie and reprinted as a book during 1981).\n* Thrump-O-Moto (1986), illustrated by George Sharp\n\nNon-fiction\n\n* The Art of War (1983), a translation of Sun Tzu's book.\n\nInteractive fiction\n\n*Shōgun (1988 adaptation by Infocom, Inc., for Amiga, Apple II, DOS, Macintosh), interactive fiction with graphics and puzzle-solving; the user plays John Blackthorne, the first Englishman to set foot on Japanese soil\n*Shōgun (1986 adaptation by Virgin Games, Ltd., for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, DOS), interactive fiction with a third-person perspective; the user wanders around as one of a number of characters trying to improve his/her rapport with other people, battling and working to becoming a shogun\n\nPolitics and later life\n\nDuring 1963, Clavell became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Politically, he was said to have been an ardent individualist and proponent of laissez-faire capitalism, as many of his books' heroes exemplify. Clavell admired Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist school of philosophy, and sent her a copy of Noble House during 1981 inscribed: \"This is for Ayn Rand—one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks. James C, New York, 2 September 81.\"\n\nDeath\n\nDuring 1994, Clavell died in Switzerland, from a stroke while suffering from cancer. He died one month before his 73rd birthday. After sponsorship by his widow, the library and archive of the Royal Artillery Museum at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in southeast London, was renamed the James Clavell Library in his honour. The library was later closed pending the opening of a new facility in Salisbury, Wiltshire; however, James Clavell Square on the Woolwich riverside remains.",
