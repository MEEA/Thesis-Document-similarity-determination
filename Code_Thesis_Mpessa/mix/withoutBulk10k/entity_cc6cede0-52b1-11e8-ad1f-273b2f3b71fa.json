It allows for one to infer a biconditional from two conditional statements. The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a logical proof.

For example, from the statements \"if I'm breathing, then I'm alive\" and \"if I'm alive, then I'm breathing\", it can be inferred that \"I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive\".
