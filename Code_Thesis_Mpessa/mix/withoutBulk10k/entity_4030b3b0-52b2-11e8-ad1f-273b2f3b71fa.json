  "textBody" : "Manx (native name  or , pronounced or),Jackson 1955, 49 also known as Manx Gaelic, and also historically spelled Manks, is a Goidelic Celtic language of the Indo-European language family, historically spoken by the Manx people. Only a small minority of the Isle of Man's population is fluent in the language, but a larger minority has some knowledge of it and Manx is considered an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Although the last surviving native speaker of the language, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974, the language has never fallen completely out of use. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts, and in recent years Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a bilingual primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded; for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.\n\nNames of the language\n\nIn Manx\n\nIn Manx, the language is called Gaelg or Gailck (pronounced \"gilk\" with a hard G), a word which shares the same etymology as the word \"Gaelic\", borrowed from Irish. The sister languages of Irish and Scottish Gaelic use Gaeilge (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and Gàidhlig, respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the definite article is frequently used in Manx, e.g. y Ghaelg or y Ghailck (Irish an Ghaeilge, Scottish a' Ghàidhlig).\n\nTo distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases Gaelg/Gailck Vannin (Gaelic of Mann) and Gaelg/Gailck Vanninnagh (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname \"Çhengey ny Mayrey\" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.\n\nIn English\n\nThe language is usually referred to in English as \"Manx\". The term \"Manx Gaelic\" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Anglo-Manx, the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply \"Gaelic\", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.\n\nA feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic is the use of the definite article, e.g. \"the Manx\", \"the Gaelic\", in ways not generally seen in standard English.\n\nThe word \"Manx\" is frequently spelled \"Manks\" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means \"Mannish\", and originates from the Old Norse Mannisk. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled \"Mann\". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, \"MAN-en\". The island is named after the Irish god Manannán mac Lir, thus Ellan Vannin (Irish Oileán Mhannanáin) 'Mannanán's Island'.\n\nHistory\n\nManx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. On the whole it is not mutually intelligible with these, though a native speaker of one finds it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.\n\nThe earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of Brythonic (the language which developed into Welsh, Cornish and Breton); however, like Scottish Gaelic and modern Irish, Manx is descended from Primitive Irish, which is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man. By the 10th century Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland, in Scotland and in the Isle of Man. Like the coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, the Isle of Man was colonised by the Norse, who left their legacy in certain loanwords, personal names, and place names such as Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa). However, they made very little impact on the language overall.\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the English language has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbors.\n\nIn the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.\n\nThomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767.  In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.\n\nIn 1848, J. G. Cumming wrote, \"there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.\" Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.Gunther 1990, 59–60 Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic \"prestige\", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.\n\nRevival\n\nFollowing the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century,  (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century, only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on December 27, 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few individuals had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer Brian Stowell, \"which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.\"Ager, Simon. \"A Study of Language Death and Revival with a Particular Focus on Manx Gaelic.\" Master's Dissertation University of Wales, Lampeter, 2009. PDF. This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by language enthusiast and fluent speaker Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language. The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalization.\n\nOn September 29, 2017, Taiwan-based language learning company Glossika released a free Manx course on their website, shortly after the release of their other internet-based products. Please fix my citations https://www.facebook.com/groups/glossikadiscussion/permalink/892150907603011/Please fix my citations https://ai.glossika.com/app/courses\n\nIn 2009, Unesco's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger declared Manx as an extinct language, despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man. Since then, Unesco's classification of the language has changed to \"critically endangered\".\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] . Retrieved 2012-10-19. an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census. These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in Douglas 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in Peel, 146 in Onchan, and 149 in Ramsey.\n\nTraditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the Isle of Man, especially Moirrey and Voirrey (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish Moira, but often mispronounced as Moiree/Voiree when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), Illiam (William), Orry (from the Manx King of Norse origin), Breeshey (also Breesha) (Bridget), Aalish (also Ealish) (Alice), Juan (Jack), Ean (John), Joney, Fenella (Fionnuala), Pherick (Patrick) and Freya (from the Norse Goddess) remain popular.\n\nNumber of speakers by year \n\nLiterature\n\nBecause Manx has never had a large number of speakers, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The \"Fianna\" tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad Fin as Oshin, commemorating Finn MacCool and Ossian. With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of carvals - religious songs or carols - developed with religious sanction.\n\nAs far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the Reformation. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey), translated by Bishop of Man Thomas Wilson.\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer was translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Bishop of Sodor and Man (1605–33). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.\n\nThe New Testament was first published in 1767. When the Anglican church authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further \"anglicised\"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of  to represent schwa (e.g.  \"horse\" and  \"help\" as well as (e.g.  \"knowledge\"), though it is also used to represent, as in English (e.g.  \"John\" (vocative),  \"fish\").\n\nOther works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of Paradise Lost was made in 1796.\n\nA considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley (The Vampire Murders) was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the Gruffalo and Gruffalo's Child.\n\nOfficial recognition\n\nParliament and politics\n\nAlthough Manx is commonly used for written slogans by local businesses and appears on department letterheads and promotional materials within the Isle of Man government, it is not used as a spoken language within the business community, or spoken within the government. A few token words are used in routine debates and proceedings of the Keys, the Council and Tynwald Court, as may be verified by reference to Hansard. The Standing Orders of the House of Keys, for example, provide:\n\nThe proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation.\n\nManx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony, with new laws being promulgated in English and also by  (\"The Reader\") in Manx.\n\nManx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is one of the regional languages recognised in the framework of the British-Irish Council.\n\nPolitical parties have not generally been prominent in Manx politics. Notably two of them, Mec Vannin and Liberal Vannin, bear Manx (or partly Manx) names, although the former no longer stands in elections.\n\nEducation\n\nManx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the Department of Education's [https://www2.sch.im/groups/manxlanguage/wiki/e1ced/Failt__Welcome.html Manx Language Team] who teach up to A Level standard. At present roughly 1000 children receive some Manx language provision each year in the island's schools.\n\nThe Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a primary school at St John's, has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel.\n\nThe playgroup organisation Mooinjer Veggey, which operates the , runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.\n\nThe first native speakers of Manx (bilingual with English) in many years have now appeared: children brought up by Manx-speaking parents.\n\nCulture Vannin launched for the first time in 2016 a bursary scheme  that enables young fluent speakers of Manx to learn Irish in Donegal.\n\nLearning the language \n\nThere are an increasing number of resources available for those wanting to learn the language.

It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song. Recently a new short film, Solace, was produced with financial assistance from Culture Vannin. A series of short cartoons about the life of Cuchulain which were produced by BBC Northern Ireland are available as are a series of cartoons on Manx mythology. Most significant is a 13-part DVD series Manx translation of the award-winning series [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vs9n5kihxGf8&list\nPLY5y-gRhKs8jDsAbo2Didfz_f51br-kUx Friends and Heroes].\n\nSignage\n\nBilingual road, street, village and town boundary signs are common throughout the Isle of Man. All other road signs are in English only.\n\nBusiness signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law.\n\nThe Manx Bible\n\nIn the time of Bishop Wilson it had been a constant source of complaint among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.\n\nThe Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest (the New Testament of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) from the Apocrypha. Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\nThis 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as ben-oast, a hostess or female inn-keeper.\n\nThere was a translation of the Psalmyn Ghavid (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the Book of Common Prayer of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these Metrical Psalms were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the Manx Language Society in 1905.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. Yn Vible Casherick (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted Noo Ean (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.\n\nSince 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.\n\nChurch\n\nManx was used in some churches into the late 19th century. Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nvY9VF_bkZsw Christmas Service] at locations around the island.\n\nClassification and dialects\n\nManx is one of the three descendants of Old Irish (via Middle Irish and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 1:xxvii–xxviii, 160\n\nManx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive palatalisation of labial consonants; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants contrast phonemically with palatalised, in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both Mayo Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also Ó Baoill 1978, 87) A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final (spelled -(a)ibh, -(a)imh in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with (-(e)abh, -(e)amh) in Manx; both have become, spelled -oo or -u(e). Examples include  (\"to stand\"; Irish ),  (\"religion\"; Irish ),  (\"fainting\"; Early Modern Irish , lit. in clouds), and  (\"on you (plural)\"; Irish ).O'Rahilly 1932, 77–82; Broderick 1984–86, 2:152 However, Manx is further advanced in this than is Scottish, where the verb ending -ibh second person plural is consistently [-iv], as it is in the second plural pronoun sibh (shiu in Manx).\n\nLike western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters to. For example, Middle Irish  (\"mockery\") and  (\"women\") have become  and  respectively in Manx.O'Rahilly 1932, 22 The affrication of to is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.O'Rahilly 1932, 203\n\nAlso like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre), the unstressed word-final syllable of Middle Irish (spelled -(a)idh and -(a)igh) has developed to in Manx, where it is spelled -ee, as in  (\"buy\"; cf. Irish ) and  (\"apparatus\"; cf. Gaelic ).O'Rahilly 1932, 57\n\nAnother property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that rather than appears in unstressed syllables before (in Manx spelling, agh), for example  (\"straight\") (Irish ),  (\"to remember\") (Gaelic ).O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55\n\nSimilarly to Munster Irish, historical bh and mh (nasalised) have been lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as u resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx  (\"winter\") and  (\"mountains\") correspond to Irish  and  (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation gíre and sléte).O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984–86 3:80–83; Ó Sé 2000:15, 120 Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs before velarised consonants (spelled ao in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to in many words, as in  (\"carpenter\") and  (\"narrow\") (spelled  and  in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).Jackson 1955, 47–50; Ó Cuív 1944, 38, 91\n\nLike southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants. For example,  (\"children\"),  (\"brown\"),  (\"butter\") correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic , , and  respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus western Irish, Southern Irish/Northern Scottish,,), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre,, and.O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57–58; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41\n\nAnother similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed, spelled -(e)adh in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g.  (\"war\"),  (\"to praise\"); cf. Irish  and , pronounced and in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 68; Broderick 1984–86, 2:56, 308 In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) became in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g.  (\"would praise\"), cf. Irish , pronounced in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 75\n\nLinguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from Maughold in the northeast of the island to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the Sheading of Rushen. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.\n\nIn Southern Manx, older á and in some cases ó have become. In Northern Manx the same happens, but á sometimes remains as well. For example,  (\"day\", cf. Irish ) is in the south but or in the north. Old ó is always in both dialects, e.g.  (\"young\", cf. Irish ) is in both dialects.Broderick 1984–8,6 1:160\n\nIn Northern Manx, older (e)a before nn in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong. For example,  (\"head\", cf. Irish ) is in the north but in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161\n\nWords with ua and in some cases ao in Irish and Scottish are spelled with eay in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is, while in Southern Manx it is,, or. For example,  (\"wind\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and in the south, while  (\"coal\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and,, or in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161–62\n\nIn both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short sound before a word-final in monosyllabic words, as in for  (\"whole\") and for  (\"woman\"). This phenomenon is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of before and of before, as in for  (\"walking\") and for  (\"ship\"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of before, on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in  (\"heavy\"), which is in the north but or in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:162–63 This feature is also found in Cornish.\n\nSouthern Manx tends to lose word-initial before, while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g.  (\"glen\") is in the north and in the south, and  (\"knee\") is in the north and in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:164–65\n\nPhrases\n\nSome simple conversational words and phrases:\n\nOrthography\n\nThe Manx orthography is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use closely related modernised variants of the orthography of Early Modern Irish, the language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it is called Classical Gaelic) until the mid-19th century. These orthographies in general show both word pronunciation and word derivation from the Gaelic past, though not in a one-to-one system, there being only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English alphabet, except for  and , the 24 letters of its alphabet likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.\n\nThe orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in Welsh and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography shows the pronunciation of words mainly from the point of view of early Modern English \"phonetics\", and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from the Gaelic point of view. footnote in [https://books.google.com/books?idNZENAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPR13 Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography], credited to W. Mackenzie. The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonetic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English is inconsistent and only partially phonetic. T. F. O'Rahilly expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with a corrupt spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.O'Rahilly 1932, 128\n\nThere is no evidence of Gaelic script having been used on the island.\n\nCedilla\n\nManx uses relatively few diacritics, but a cedilla is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of ch:\n* Çhiarn, meaning lord, is pronounced with the palato-alveolar affricate, as in the English \"church\"\n* Chamoo, meaning nor or neither, is pronounced with the velar fricative, as in the Scottish pronunciation of the word \"loch\", a sound which is commonly represented by gh at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.\n\nGaelic versions of the Lord's Prayer\n\nThe Lord's Prayer has been translated into all the Goidelic tongues.

The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives are affricated to in many contexts.\n\nManx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative may be further lenited to, and may disappear altogether. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:3–13; Thomson 1992, 129\n;Voiceless plosive to voiced plosive\n* >:  \"flag, rag\"\n* >:  \"sin\"\n;Voiceless plosive to voiced fricative\n* >:  \"cup\"\n* >:  \"boat\"\n* >:  \"tooth\"\n;Voiced plosive to voiced fricative\n* >:  \"horse\"\n* >:  \"face\"\n* >:  \"prayer\"\n* > >:  \"stick\"\n* >:  \"born\"\n;Voiceless fricative to voiced fricative\n* > or:  \"married\"\n* >:  \"stand\"\n* >:  \"easy\"\n* > >:  \"beginning\"\n* >:  \"live\"\n* > > ∅:  \"past\"\n\nAnother optional process of Manx phonology is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive consonant before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:28–34; 1993, 236\n* >:  > \"heavy\"\n* >:  > \"head\"\n* >:  > \"birds\"\n* >:  > \"ship\"\n* >:  > \"walking\"\n\nThe trill is realised as a one- or two-contact flap at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, can be pronounced either as a strong trill or, more frequently, as a weak fricative, which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic or disappear altogether.Broderick 1984–86; 3:17–18 This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is itself a non-rhotic accent.Jackson 1955, 118; Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, 1998, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-ISLEOFMAN.html Isle of Man], retrieved 2008-09-28 Examples of the pronunciation of include:\n*  \"snare\"\n*  \"bread\"\n*  \"big\"\n\nVowels\n\nThe vowel phonemes of Manx are as follows:Broderick 1993, 230–33\n\nThe status of and as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as  \"is\",  \"women\", and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels and have allophones ranging from through to. As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of. This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:\n\nWhen stressed, is realised as.Broderick 1993, 232–33\n\nManx has a relatively large number of diphthongs, all of them falling:\n\nStress\n\nStress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable.Broderick 1993, 236 Examples include:\n*  \"sprite\"\n*  \"busy\"\n*  \"royal\"\n*  \"advantage\"\n\nMorphology\n\nInitial consonant mutations \n\nLike all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment.Broderick 1984–86, 1:7–21; 1993, 236–39; Thomson 1992, 132–35 Manx has two mutations: lenition and nasalisation, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not nasalisation. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.\n\nIn the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the nasalisation of: the sentence  (\"I have found the lamb\"), where ng is pronounced. However, it is possible that the verbal noun in this case is not , which usually means \"get\", but rather , which is the more usual word for \"find\".(Broderick 1984–86 2:190, 3:66).\n\nNouns \n\nManx nouns fall into one of two genders, masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for number. The plural is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix , but also by vowel change, changing  to  or  or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for case, except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix -ey to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in compounds even when they are no longer productive forms; for example  \"cowhouse\" uses the old genitive of  \"cattle\".Thomson 1992, 118–19; Broderick 1993, 239–40 There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as  \"on foot\", contrasting with nominative  and genitive  (cf.  \"footwear\",  \"football, soccer, rugby\").\n\nAdjectives \n\nCertain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition -ey), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in -agh and form their comparative/superlative form by replacing this with -ee, e.g. atçhimagh \"terrible\" becomes atçhimee, giving ny s'atçhimee \"more terrible\" and s'atçhimee \"most terrible\". A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:\n\nThe comparative/superlative can also be formed using  \"more\" with the positive form e.g.  = .\n\nPronouns \n\nIn common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. \"you were not\" is  as  sounds too similar to  \"they/he/she was not\".\n\nNotice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the initial letter change they cause, e.g.  \"her laptop\",  \"his laptop\",  \"her/his road\".\n\nAn alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of  \"at\" to show the person, e.g.  \"my house\" (literally \"the house at me\") instead of  \"my house\". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g.  \"their house\", as opposed to  \"our/your/their house\".\n\n1.^ Causes lenition.\n\n2.^ Causes eclipsis.\n\nVerbs \n\nManx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs  \"to be\" or  \"to do\" are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 75–82; 1993, 250, 271; Thomson 1992, 122 Examples:\n\nThe future and conditional tenses (and in some irregular verbs, the preterite) make a distinction between \"independent\" and \"dependent\" forms. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g.  \"not\") does precede the verb. For example, \"you will lose\" is  with the independent form  (\"will lose\"), while \"you will not lose\" is  with the dependent form  (which has undergone eclipsis to  after ). Similarly \"they went\" is  with the independent form  (\"went\"), while \"they did not go\" is  with the dependent form .Broderick 1984–86, 1:92; 1992, 250; Thomson 1992, 122 This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as  (\"(s)he carries\") vs.  (\"(s)he does not carry\"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g.  (\"will take\") vs.  (\"will not take\"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g.  (\"saw\") vs.  (\"did not see\").\n\nThe fully inflected forms of the regular verb ' \"to throw\" are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using ': ' \"thrown\".\n\n1.^ First person singular, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n2.^ First person plural, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n3.^ Used with all other persons, meaning an accompanying subject must be stated, e.g. ' \"he will throw\",  \"they will throw\"\n\nThere are a few peculiarities when a verb begins with a vowel, i.e. the addition of ' in the preterite and ' in the future and conditional dependent. Below is the conjugation of ' \"to grow\".\n\n1.^ '  may also be spelt ' when pronounced i.e. before a slender vowel, e.g. \"ate\" can be either ' or '.\n\nThese peculiarties extend to verbs begins with f, e.g. ' \"to leave\".\n\n1.^ Again, '  may also be spelt ' where appropriate.\n\nA number of verbs are irregular in their inflection. \n\n1.^ Future relative: '\n2.^ Future relative: '\n\nThe most common and most irregular verb in Manx is ' \"to be\", often used as an auxiliary verb. In addition to the usual inflected tenses, ' also has a present tense. The full conjugation of  \"to be\" is as follows.\n\nAdverbs \n\nManx adverbs can be formed from adjectives by means of the word ', e.g. ' \"good\", ' \"well\";  ' \"cheerful\", ' \"cheerfully\". This ' is omitted when preceded by such words as ' \"too\" and ' \"very\" or followed by ' \"enough\", e.g. ' \"very good, very well\", ' \"cheerful(ly) enough\". The adverb for \"home(wards)\" is formed with ' and the noun ' \"place, town, homestead\" to give ', whereas the noun ' \"house, home\" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.\n\nThe language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English \"up\" and \"down\", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.\n\nExamples of practical usage are ' \"There's a man down the street\" and ' \"I'm going down the street\", ' \"Climb up (towards me)\" and ' \"Climb up (away from me)\".\n\nPrepositions \n\nLike the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has so-called inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.\n\nIn addition to the above \"simple\" prepositions, Manx has a number of prepositions which conjugate using the possessive personal pronouns, examples of which are given below.\n\nAlternative conjugation patterns are sometimes found with these more complex prepositions using inflected prepositions, e.g. ' for ' \"concerning me\", ' \"for our sake\" instead of ' \"for our/your/their sake\".\n\nNumbers\n\nSyntax\n\nLike most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb–subject–object word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the subject, which itself precedes the direct object.Broderick 1993, 276 However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of  (\"be\") or  (\"do\"). Particles like the negative  (\"not\") precede the inflected verb. Examples:\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the auxiliary verb is a form of  (\"do\"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle :\n\nAs in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"), there are two ways of expressing \"to be\" in Manx: with the substantive verb , and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase.Broderick 1993, 276–77 Examples:\n\n \n\n \n\nWhere the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition  (\"in\") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:\n\nOtherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form  or  in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:\n\n \n\nIn questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is :\n\n \n\nVocabulary\n\nManx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).Broderick 1993, 282–83\n\nThe following table shows a selection of nouns from the Swadesh list and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.\n\nSee Celtic Swadesh lists for the complete list in all the Celtic languages.\n\nLoanwords\n\nForeign loanwords are primarily Norse and English, with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are garey (\"garden\", from garðr, \"enclosure\") and sker meaning a sea rock (from sker, compare with skjær and sker). Examples of French loanwords are danjeyr (\"danger\", from danger) and vondeish (\"advantage\", from avantage).\n\nEnglish loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. boy (\"boy\"), badjer (\"badger\"), rather than the more usual Gaelic guilley and brock. Henry Jenner, on asking someone what he was doing, was told Ta mee smokal pipe (\"I am smoking a pipe\"), and that \"[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it.\" In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.\n\nSome religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. casherick (holy), from the Latin consecrātus; mooinjer (people) from the Latin monasterium (originally a monastery; agglish (church) from the Greek ἐκκλησία (ekklesia, literally meaning assembly) and abb (abbot) from the Hebrew \"אבא\" (abba, meaning \"father\"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, ulpan has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. çhellveeish (Irish teilefís) and çhellvane meaning television and telephone respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.\n\nTo fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.\n\nGoing in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include tholtan (the \"th\" is pronounced as a \"t\") meaning a ruined farmhouse, quaaltagh meaning a first-foot, keeill meaning a church (especially an old one), cammag, traa-dy-liooar meaning \"time enough\", and Tynwald (tinvaal), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the House of Keys takes its name from Kiare as Feed (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.\n\nComparative vocabulary examples",

    "aggregatedText" : "Manx (native name  or , pronounced or),Jackson 1955, 49 also known as Manx Gaelic, and also historically spelled Manks, is a Goidelic Celtic language of the Indo-European language family, historically spoken by the Manx people. Only a small minority of the Isle of Man's population is fluent in the language, but a larger minority has some knowledge of it and Manx is considered an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Although the last surviving native speaker of the language, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974, the language has never fallen completely out of use. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts, and in recent years Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a bilingual primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded; for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.\n\nNames of the language\n\nIn Manx\n\nIn Manx, the language is called Gaelg or Gailck (pronounced \"gilk\" with a hard G), a word which shares the same etymology as the word \"Gaelic\", borrowed from Irish. The sister languages of Irish and Scottish Gaelic use Gaeilge (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and Gàidhlig, respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the definite article is frequently used in Manx, e.g. y Ghaelg or y Ghailck (Irish an Ghaeilge, Scottish a' Ghàidhlig).\n\nTo distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases Gaelg/Gailck Vannin (Gaelic of Mann) and Gaelg/Gailck Vanninnagh (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname \"Çhengey ny Mayrey\" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.\n\nIn English\n\nThe language is usually referred to in English as \"Manx\". The term \"Manx Gaelic\" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Anglo-Manx, the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply \"Gaelic\", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.\n\nA feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic is the use of the definite article, e.g. \"the Manx\", \"the Gaelic\", in ways not generally seen in standard English.\n\nThe word \"Manx\" is frequently spelled \"Manks\" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means \"Mannish\", and originates from the Old Norse Mannisk. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled \"Mann\". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, \"MAN-en\". The island is named after the Irish god Manannán mac Lir, thus Ellan Vannin (Irish Oileán Mhannanáin) 'Mannanán's Island'.\n\nHistory\n\nManx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. On the whole it is not mutually intelligible with these, though a native speaker of one finds it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.\n\nThe earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of Brythonic (the language which developed into Welsh, Cornish and Breton); however, like Scottish Gaelic and modern Irish, Manx is descended from Primitive Irish, which is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man. By the 10th century Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland, in Scotland and in the Isle of Man. Like the coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, the Isle of Man was colonised by the Norse, who left their legacy in certain loanwords, personal names, and place names such as Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa). However, they made very little impact on the language overall.\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the English language has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbors.\n\nIn the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.\n\nThomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767.  In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.\n\nIn 1848, J. G. Cumming wrote, \"there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.\" Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.Gunther 1990, 59–60 Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic \"prestige\", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.\n\nRevival\n\nFollowing the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century,  (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century, only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on December 27, 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few individuals had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer Brian Stowell, \"which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.\"Ager, Simon. \"A Study of Language Death and Revival with a Particular Focus on Manx Gaelic.\" Master's Dissertation University of Wales, Lampeter, 2009. PDF. This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by language enthusiast and fluent speaker Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language. The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalization.\n\nOn September 29, 2017, Taiwan-based language learning company Glossika released a free Manx course on their website, shortly after the release of their other internet-based products. Please fix my citations https://www.facebook.com/groups/glossikadiscussion/permalink/892150907603011/Please fix my citations https://ai.glossika.com/app/courses\n\nIn 2009, Unesco's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger declared Manx as an extinct language, despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man. Since then, Unesco's classification of the language has changed to \"critically endangered\".\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] .

These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in Douglas 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in Peel, 146 in Onchan, and 149 in Ramsey.\n\nTraditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the Isle of Man, especially Moirrey and Voirrey (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish Moira, but often mispronounced as Moiree/Voiree when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), Illiam (William), Orry (from the Manx King of Norse origin), Breeshey (also Breesha) (Bridget), Aalish (also Ealish) (Alice), Juan (Jack), Ean (John), Joney, Fenella (Fionnuala), Pherick (Patrick) and Freya (from the Norse Goddess) remain popular.\n\nNumber of speakers by year \n\nLiterature\n\nBecause Manx has never had a large number of speakers, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The \"Fianna\" tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad Fin as Oshin, commemorating Finn MacCool and Ossian. With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of carvals - religious songs or carols - developed with religious sanction.\n\nAs far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the Reformation. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey), translated by Bishop of Man Thomas Wilson.\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer was translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Bishop of Sodor and Man (1605–33). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.\n\nThe New Testament was first published in 1767. When the Anglican church authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further \"anglicised\"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of  to represent schwa (e.g.  \"horse\" and  \"help\" as well as (e.g.  \"knowledge\"), though it is also used to represent, as in English (e.g.  \"John\" (vocative),  \"fish\").\n\nOther works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of Paradise Lost was made in 1796.\n\nA considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley (The Vampire Murders) was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the Gruffalo and Gruffalo's Child.\n\nOfficial recognition\n\nParliament and politics\n\nAlthough Manx is commonly used for written slogans by local businesses and appears on department letterheads and promotional materials within the Isle of Man government, it is not used as a spoken language within the business community, or spoken within the government. A few token words are used in routine debates and proceedings of the Keys, the Council and Tynwald Court, as may be verified by reference to Hansard. The Standing Orders of the House of Keys, for example, provide:\n\nThe proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation.\n\nManx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony, with new laws being promulgated in English and also by  (\"The Reader\") in Manx.\n\nManx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is one of the regional languages recognised in the framework of the British-Irish Council.\n\nPolitical parties have not generally been prominent in Manx politics. Notably two of them, Mec Vannin and Liberal Vannin, bear Manx (or partly Manx) names, although the former no longer stands in elections.\n\nEducation\n\nManx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the Department of Education's [https://www2.sch.im/groups/manxlanguage/wiki/e1ced/Failt__Welcome.html Manx Language Team] who teach up to A Level standard. At present roughly 1000 children receive some Manx language provision each year in the island's schools.\n\nThe Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a primary school at St John's, has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel.\n\nThe playgroup organisation Mooinjer Veggey, which operates the , runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.\n\nThe first native speakers of Manx (bilingual with English) in many years have now appeared: children brought up by Manx-speaking parents.\n\nCulture Vannin launched for the first time in 2016 a bursary scheme  that enables young fluent speakers of Manx to learn Irish in Donegal.\n\nLearning the language \n\nThere are an increasing number of resources available for those wanting to learn the language. The Manx Language Development Officer for Culture Vannin manages the [http://www.learnmanx.com/ Learnmanx.com] website which has a wide variety of resources.

It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song. Recently a new short film, Solace, was produced with financial assistance from Culture Vannin. A series of short cartoons about the life of Cuchulain which were produced by BBC Northern Ireland are available as are a series of cartoons on Manx mythology. Most significant is a 13-part DVD series Manx translation of the award-winning series [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vs9n5kihxGf8&list\nPLY5y-gRhKs8jDsAbo2Didfz_f51br-kUx Friends and Heroes].\n\nSignage\n\nBilingual road, street, village and town boundary signs are common throughout the Isle of Man. All other road signs are in English only.\n\nBusiness signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law.\n\nThe Manx Bible\n\nIn the time of Bishop Wilson it had been a constant source of complaint among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.\n\nThe Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest (the New Testament of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) from the Apocrypha. Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\nThis 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as ben-oast, a hostess or female inn-keeper.\n\nThere was a translation of the Psalmyn Ghavid (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the Book of Common Prayer of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these Metrical Psalms were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the Manx Language Society in 1905.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. Yn Vible Casherick (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted Noo Ean (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.\n\nSince 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.\n\nChurch\n\nManx was used in some churches into the late 19th century. Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nvY9VF_bkZsw Christmas Service] at locations around the island.\n\nClassification and dialects\n\nManx is one of the three descendants of Old Irish (via Middle Irish and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 1:xxvii–xxviii, 160\n\nManx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive palatalisation of labial consonants; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants contrast phonemically with palatalised, in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both Mayo Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also Ó Baoill 1978, 87) A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final (spelled -(a)ibh, -(a)imh in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with (-(e)abh, -(e)amh) in Manx; both have become, spelled -oo or -u(e). Examples include  (\"to stand\"; Irish ),  (\"religion\"; Irish ),  (\"fainting\"; Early Modern Irish , lit. in clouds), and  (\"on you (plural)\"; Irish ).O'Rahilly 1932, 77–82; Broderick 1984–86, 2:152 However, Manx is further advanced in this than is Scottish, where the verb ending -ibh second person plural is consistently [-iv], as it is in the second plural pronoun sibh (shiu in Manx).\n\nLike western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters to. For example, Middle Irish  (\"mockery\") and  (\"women\") have become  and  respectively in Manx.O'Rahilly 1932, 22 The affrication of to is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.O'Rahilly 1932, 203\n\nAlso like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre), the unstressed word-final syllable of Middle Irish (spelled -(a)idh and -(a)igh) has developed to in Manx, where it is spelled -ee, as in  (\"buy\"; cf. Irish ) and  (\"apparatus\"; cf. Gaelic ).O'Rahilly 1932, 57\n\nAnother property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that rather than appears in unstressed syllables before (in Manx spelling, agh), for example  (\"straight\") (Irish ),  (\"to remember\") (Gaelic ).O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55\n\nSimilarly to Munster Irish, historical bh and mh (nasalised) have been lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as u resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx  (\"winter\") and  (\"mountains\") correspond to Irish  and  (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation gíre and sléte).O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984–86 3:80–83; Ó Sé 2000:15, 120 Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs before velarised consonants (spelled ao in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to in many words, as in  (\"carpenter\") and  (\"narrow\") (spelled  and  in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).Jackson 1955, 47–50; Ó Cuív 1944, 38, 91\n\nLike southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants. For example,  (\"children\"),  (\"brown\"),  (\"butter\") correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic , , and  respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus western Irish, Southern Irish/Northern Scottish,,), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre,, and.O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57–58; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41\n\nAnother similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed, spelled -(e)adh in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g.  (\"war\"),  (\"to praise\"); cf. Irish  and , pronounced and in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 68; Broderick 1984–86, 2:56, 308 In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) became in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g.  (\"would praise\"), cf. Irish , pronounced in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 75\n\nLinguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from Maughold in the northeast of the island to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the Sheading of Rushen. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.\n\nIn Southern Manx, older á and in some cases ó have become. In Northern Manx the same happens, but á sometimes remains as well. For example,  (\"day\", cf. Irish ) is in the south but or in the north. Old ó is always in both dialects, e.g.  (\"young\", cf. Irish ) is in both dialects.Broderick 1984–8,6 1:160\n\nIn Northern Manx, older (e)a before nn in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong. For example,  (\"head\", cf. Irish ) is in the north but in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161\n\nWords with ua and in some cases ao in Irish and Scottish are spelled with eay in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is, while in Southern Manx it is,, or. For example,  (\"wind\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and in the south, while  (\"coal\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and,, or in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161–62\n\nIn both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short sound before a word-final in monosyllabic words, as in for  (\"whole\") and for  (\"woman\"). This phenomenon is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of before and of before, as in for  (\"walking\") and for  (\"ship\"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of before, on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in  (\"heavy\"), which is in the north but or in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:162–63 This feature is also found in Cornish.\n\nSouthern Manx tends to lose word-initial before, while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g.  (\"glen\") is in the north and in the south, and  (\"knee\") is in the north and in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:164–65\n\nPhrases\n\nSome simple conversational words and phrases:\n\nOrthography\n\nThe Manx orthography is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use closely related modernised variants of the orthography of Early Modern Irish, the language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it is called Classical Gaelic) until the mid-19th century. These orthographies in general show both word pronunciation and word derivation from the Gaelic past, though not in a one-to-one system, there being only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English alphabet, except for  and , the 24 letters of its alphabet likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.\n\nThe orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in Welsh and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography shows the pronunciation of words mainly from the point of view of early Modern English \"phonetics\", and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from the Gaelic point of view. footnote in [https://books.google.com/books?idNZENAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPR13 Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography], credited to W. Mackenzie. The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonetic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English is inconsistent and only partially phonetic. T. F. O'Rahilly expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with a corrupt spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.O'Rahilly 1932, 128\n\nThere is no evidence of Gaelic script having been used on the island.\n\nCedilla\n\nManx uses relatively few diacritics, but a cedilla is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of ch:\n* Çhiarn, meaning lord, is pronounced with the palato-alveolar affricate, as in the English \"church\"\n* Chamoo, meaning nor or neither, is pronounced with the velar fricative, as in the Scottish pronunciation of the word \"loch\", a sound which is commonly represented by gh at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.\n\nGaelic versions of the Lord's Prayer\n\nThe Lord's Prayer has been translated into all the Goidelic tongues.

The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives are affricated to in many contexts.\n\nManx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative may be further lenited to, and may disappear altogether. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:3–13; Thomson 1992, 129\n;Voiceless plosive to voiced plosive\n* >:  \"flag, rag\"\n* >:  \"sin\"\n;Voiceless plosive to voiced fricative\n* >:  \"cup\"\n* >:  \"boat\"\n* >:  \"tooth\"\n;Voiced plosive to voiced fricative\n* >:  \"horse\"\n* >:  \"face\"\n* >:  \"prayer\"\n* > >:  \"stick\"\n* >:  \"born\"\n;Voiceless fricative to voiced fricative\n* > or:  \"married\"\n* >:  \"stand\"\n* >:  \"easy\"\n* > >:  \"beginning\"\n* >:  \"live\"\n* > > ∅:  \"past\"\n\nAnother optional process of Manx phonology is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive consonant before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:28–34; 1993, 236\n* >:  > \"heavy\"\n* >:  > \"head\"\n* >:  > \"birds\"\n* >:  > \"ship\"\n* >:  > \"walking\"\n\nThe trill is realised as a one- or two-contact flap at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, can be pronounced either as a strong trill or, more frequently, as a weak fricative, which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic or disappear altogether.Broderick 1984–86; 3:17–18 This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is itself a non-rhotic accent.Jackson 1955, 118; Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, 1998, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-ISLEOFMAN.html Isle of Man], retrieved 2008-09-28 Examples of the pronunciation of include:\n*  \"snare\"\n*  \"bread\"\n*  \"big\"\n\nVowels\n\nThe vowel phonemes of Manx are as follows:Broderick 1993, 230–33\n\nThe status of and as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as  \"is\",  \"women\", and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels and have allophones ranging from through to. As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of. This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:\n\nWhen stressed, is realised as.Broderick 1993, 232–33\n\nManx has a relatively large number of diphthongs, all of them falling:\n\nStress\n\nStress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable.Broderick 1993, 236 Examples include:\n*  \"sprite\"\n*  \"busy\"\n*  \"royal\"\n*  \"advantage\"\n\nMorphology\n\nInitial consonant mutations \n\nLike all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment.Broderick 1984–86, 1:7–21; 1993, 236–39; Thomson 1992, 132–35 Manx has two mutations: lenition and nasalisation, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not nasalisation. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.\n\nIn the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the nasalisation of: the sentence  (\"I have found the lamb\"), where ng is pronounced. However, it is possible that the verbal noun in this case is not , which usually means \"get\", but rather , which is the more usual word for \"find\".(Broderick 1984–86 2:190, 3:66).\n\nNouns \n\nManx nouns fall into one of two genders, masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for number. The plural is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix , but also by vowel change, changing  to  or  or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for case, except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix -ey to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in compounds even when they are no longer productive forms; for example  \"cowhouse\" uses the old genitive of  \"cattle\".Thomson 1992, 118–19; Broderick 1993, 239–40 There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as  \"on foot\", contrasting with nominative  and genitive  (cf.  \"footwear\",  \"football, soccer, rugby\").\n\nAdjectives \n\nCertain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition -ey), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in -agh and form their comparative/superlative form by replacing this with -ee, e.g. atçhimagh \"terrible\" becomes atçhimee, giving ny s'atçhimee \"more terrible\" and s'atçhimee \"most terrible\". A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:\n\nThe comparative/superlative can also be formed using  \"more\" with the positive form e.g.  = .\n\nPronouns \n\nIn common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. \"you were not\" is  as  sounds too similar to  \"they/he/she was not\".\n\nNotice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the initial letter change they cause, e.g.  \"her laptop\",  \"his laptop\",  \"her/his road\".\n\nAn alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of  \"at\" to show the person, e.g.  \"my house\" (literally \"the house at me\") instead of  \"my house\". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g.  \"their house\", as opposed to  \"our/your/their house\".\n\n1.^ Causes lenition.\n\n2.^ Causes eclipsis.\n\nVerbs \n\nManx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs  \"to be\" or  \"to do\" are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 75–82; 1993, 250, 271; Thomson 1992, 122 Examples:\n\nThe future and conditional tenses (and in some irregular verbs, the preterite) make a distinction between \"independent\" and \"dependent\" forms. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g.  \"not\") does precede the verb. For example, \"you will lose\" is  with the independent form  (\"will lose\"), while \"you will not lose\" is  with the dependent form  (which has undergone eclipsis to  after ). Similarly \"they went\" is  with the independent form  (\"went\"), while \"they did not go\" is  with the dependent form .Broderick 1984–86, 1:92; 1992, 250; Thomson 1992, 122 This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as  (\"(s)he carries\") vs.  (\"(s)he does not carry\"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g.  (\"will take\") vs.  (\"will not take\"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g.  (\"saw\") vs.  (\"did not see\").\n\nThe fully inflected forms of the regular verb ' \"to throw\" are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using ': ' \"thrown\".\n\n1.^ First person singular, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n2.^ First person plural, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n3.^ Used with all other persons, meaning an accompanying subject must be stated, e.g. ' \"he will throw\",  \"they will throw\"\n\nThere are a few peculiarities when a verb begins with a vowel, i.e. the addition of ' in the preterite and ' in the future and conditional dependent. Below is the conjugation of ' \"to grow\".\n\n1.^ '  may also be spelt ' when pronounced i.e. before a slender vowel, e.g. \"ate\" can be either ' or '.\n\nThese peculiarties extend to verbs begins with f, e.g. ' \"to leave\".\n\n1.^ Again, '  may also be spelt ' where appropriate.\n\nA number of verbs are irregular in their inflection. \n\n1.^ Future relative: '\n2.^ Future relative: '\n\nThe most common and most irregular verb in Manx is ' \"to be\", often used as an auxiliary verb. In addition to the usual inflected tenses, ' also has a present tense. The full conjugation of  \"to be\" is as follows.\n\nAdverbs \n\nManx adverbs can be formed from adjectives by means of the word ', e.g. ' \"good\", ' \"well\";  ' \"cheerful\", ' \"cheerfully\". This ' is omitted when preceded by such words as ' \"too\" and ' \"very\" or followed by ' \"enough\", e.g. ' \"very good, very well\", ' \"cheerful(ly) enough\". The adverb for \"home(wards)\" is formed with ' and the noun ' \"place, town, homestead\" to give ', whereas the noun ' \"house, home\" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.\n\nThe language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English \"up\" and \"down\", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.\n\nExamples of practical usage are ' \"There's a man down the street\" and ' \"I'm going down the street\", ' \"Climb up (towards me)\" and ' \"Climb up (away from me)\".\n\nPrepositions \n\nLike the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has so-called inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.\n\nIn addition to the above \"simple\" prepositions, Manx has a number of prepositions which conjugate using the possessive personal pronouns, examples of which are given below.\n\nAlternative conjugation patterns are sometimes found with these more complex prepositions using inflected prepositions, e.g. ' for ' \"concerning me\", ' \"for our sake\" instead of ' \"for our/your/their sake\".\n\nNumbers\n\nSyntax\n\nLike most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb–subject–object word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the subject, which itself precedes the direct object.Broderick 1993, 276 However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of  (\"be\") or  (\"do\"). Particles like the negative  (\"not\") precede the inflected verb. Examples:\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the auxiliary verb is a form of  (\"do\"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle :\n\nAs in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"), there are two ways of expressing \"to be\" in Manx: with the substantive verb , and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase.Broderick 1993, 276–77 Examples:\n\n \n\n \n\nWhere the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition  (\"in\") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:\n\nOtherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form  or  in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:\n\n \n\nIn questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is :\n\n \n\nVocabulary\n\nManx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).Broderick 1993, 282–83\n\nThe following table shows a selection of nouns from the Swadesh list and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.\n\nSee Celtic Swadesh lists for the complete list in all the Celtic languages.\n\nLoanwords\n\nForeign loanwords are primarily Norse and English, with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are garey (\"garden\", from garðr, \"enclosure\") and sker meaning a sea rock (from sker, compare with skjær and sker). Examples of French loanwords are danjeyr (\"danger\", from danger) and vondeish (\"advantage\", from avantage).\n\nEnglish loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. boy (\"boy\"), badjer (\"badger\"), rather than the more usual Gaelic guilley and brock. Henry Jenner, on asking someone what he was doing, was told Ta mee smokal pipe (\"I am smoking a pipe\"), and that \"[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it.\" In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.\n\nSome religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. casherick (holy), from the Latin consecrātus; mooinjer (people) from the Latin monasterium (originally a monastery; agglish (church) from the Greek ἐκκλησία (ekklesia, literally meaning assembly) and abb (abbot) from the Hebrew \"אבא\" (abba, meaning \"father\"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, ulpan has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. çhellveeish (Irish teilefís) and çhellvane meaning television and telephone respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.\n\nTo fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.\n\nGoing in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include tholtan (the \"th\" is pronounced as a \"t\") meaning a ruined farmhouse, quaaltagh meaning a first-foot, keeill meaning a church (especially an old one), cammag, traa-dy-liooar meaning \"time enough\", and Tynwald (tinvaal), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the House of Keys takes its name from Kiare as Feed (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.\n\nComparative vocabulary examples.
