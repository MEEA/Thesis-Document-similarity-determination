  "textBody" : "The RUR-5 ASROC (for \"Anti-Submarine ROCket\") is an all-weather, all sea-conditions anti-submarine missile system. Developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s, it was deployed in the 1960s, updated in the 1990s, and eventually installed on over 200 USN surface ships, specifically cruisers, destroyers, and frigates. The ASROC has been deployed on scores of warships of many other navies, including Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of China, Greece, Pakistan and others.\n\nHistory\n\nASROC started development as the Rocket Assisted Torpedo (RAT) program by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake in the early 1950s to develop a surface warship ASW weapon counter to the new post-World War II submarines which ran quieter, at much higher speed and could attack from much longer range with high speed homing torpedoes. In addition, the goal was to take advantage of modern sonars with a much larger detection range. An extended range torpedo delivered by parachute from the air would allow warships the stand-off capability to attack hostile submarines with very little advance notice to the hostile submarine. The RAT program came in three phases:[https://books.google.com/books?id5d0DAAAAMBAJ&pg\nPA108&lpgPA108&dq\nrocket+assisted+torpedo&sourcebl&ots\nIxAcbiK5G9&sigsVL0o_Sv_k-WB8CalZCpLuBvv78&hl\nen&saX&ei\nR-TqTrbYDtK-gAf8o82YCQ&sqi2&ved\n0CEEQ6AEwAw#vonepage&q\nrocket%20assisted%20torpedo&f=true \"Navy Homing Torpedoes Fights Subs.\"] Popular Mechanics, April 1958, p. 108.  RAT-A, RAT-B and RAT-C. RAT-A (and its follow-on, RAT-B) were efforts to develop a compact and economical stand-off ASW for smaller warships, but were found to be either unreliable or had too short a range. RAT-C was a program to develop a stand-off ASW weapon that used a nuclear depth charge. This would require a range of at least 8,000 yards to escape potential damage from the underwater blast. Unlike the original RAT program rockets, the RAT-C was considerably larger to accomplish the extended range needed and was to be fitted to larger warships. With the failure of both the RAT-A and RAT-B programs, RAT-C was redesigned from a stand-off nuclear ASW weapon to one that could use not only a nuclear depth charge but also a homing ASW torpedo. To obtain the accuracy needed, the RAT-C rocket launcher had to be redesigned with larger side fins. This program finally combined reliability and accuracy, along with the necessary stand-off range. However, before RAT-C reached initial operational status in 1960 aboard the large US Navy destroyer leader , its name was changed to the present ASROC.Bill Gunston Rocket & Missiles, Salamander Books Ltd 1979, ISSB 0-517-26870-1Norman Friedman U.S. Destroyers Naval Institute Press (April 1982), , p. 280\n\nDescription\n\nThe first ASROC system using the MK-112 \"Matchbox\" launcher, was developed in the 1950s and installed in the 1960s.

At a pre-determined point on the missile's trajectory, the payload separates from the missile and deploys a parachute to permit splashdown and water entry at a low speed and with minimum detectable noise. Water entry activates the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, and homes in on the target using either active sonar or passive sonar.\n\nW44 nuclear depth charge\n\nThe W44 nuclear depth charge entered service in 1961, but was never used beyond one or two tests before the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banning underwater nuclear tests went into effect. A total of 575 weapons were produced. The W44 weighed 170 lb with a diameter of  and length of . Following payload separation, the unguided W44 sank quickly to a predetermined depth where the 10-kiloton warhead detonated. The nuclear-armed ASROC was never used in combat.

The \"matchbox\" Mk 112 launchers were capable of carrying a mixture of the two types.
