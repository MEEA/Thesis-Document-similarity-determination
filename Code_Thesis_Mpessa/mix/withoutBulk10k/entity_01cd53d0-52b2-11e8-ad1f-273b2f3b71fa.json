  "textBody" : "\"God Save the Queen\" (alternatively \"God Save the King\", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is the national or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown Dependencies. The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.\n\nIt is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem – played specifically in the presence of the monarch – of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of \"God Save the Queen\" has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. In the United States, the melody is used for the patriotic song \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\". The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, \"Oben am jungen Rhein\".\n\nBeyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders.cf. the versions in the hymn books English Hymnal, Hymns Ancient and Modern, and Songs of Praise In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung, and on rare occasions, three.\n\nThe sovereign and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire anthem, while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of \"God Save the Queen\" followed by the first four and last four bars of \"O Canada\"), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.\n\nHistory\n\nIn The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to \"God Save the King/Queen\". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see musica ficta). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, set to the words \"God Save the King\". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, \"Remember O Thou Man\" was the source of the tune.\n\nThe first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman's Magazine (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nScholes' analysis includes mention of \"untenable\" and \"doubtful\" claims, as well as \"an American misattribution\". Some of these are:\n* The French Marquise de Créquy wrote in her Souvenirs that the words \"Grand Dieu, sauvez le Roi!\" were indeed composed by Jean-Baptiste Lully in gratitude for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation. (The surgical knife purpose-made for the occasion is on display in the Musée d'histoire de la médecine.) Allegedly, Lully had set words by Marie de Brinon to music, and Créquy claimed that the tune was later plagiarised by Handel, and so adopted by the British as \"un de leurs air nationaux\". (The entire story might have been intended as a joke.) Translated into Latin under the title Domine, Salvum Fac Regem, it became the French anthem until 1792.See the sheet music available online:  After the Battle of Culloden, the Hanover dynasty supposedly adopted this melody as the British anthem.\n* James Oswald was a possible author of the Thesaurus Musicus, so may have played a part in the history of the song, but is not a strong enough candidate to be cited as the composer of the tune.\n* Dr Henry Carey: Scholes refutes this attribution: first on the grounds that Carey himself never made such a claim; second, when the claim was made by Carey's son (in 1795), it was in support of a request for a pension from the British Government; and third, the younger Carey claimed that his father, who died in 1743, had written parts of the song in 1745. It has also been claimed that the work was first publicly performed by Carey during a dinner in 1740 in honour of Admiral Edward \"Grog\" Vernon, who had captured the Spanish harbour of Porto Bello (then in Gran Colombia, now in Panamá) during the War of Jenkins' Ear.\n\nScholes recommends the attribution \"traditional\" or \"traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562–1628)\". The English Hymnal (musical editor Ralph Vaughan Williams) gives no attribution, stating merely \"17th or 18th cent.\"Hymn No. 560 \"National Anthem\"\n\nOriginal lyrics \n\nGod save great George our king\nGod save our noble king,\nGod save the king!\nSend him victorious\nHappy and glorious\nLong to reign over us\nGod save the king!\n\nUse in the United Kingdom\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. In general only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions three.  The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the Queen\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.\n\nEngland has no official national anthem of its own; \"God Save the Queen\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where Jerusalem is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry's \"Jerusalem\" and Elgar's \"Land of Hope and Glory\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football, rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently. On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \"Scotland the Brave\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \"Flower of Scotland\" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, \"God Save the Queen\" is still used as the official anthem.\n\nThe phrase \"No surrender\" is occasionally sung in the bridge before \"Send her victorious\" by England football fans at matches. The phrase \"no surrender\" is also associated with Combat 18, a white supremacist group. The phrase is also associated with Ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.\n\nSince 2003, \"God Save the Queen\", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the \"Londonderry Air\", popularly known as \"Danny Boy\". In 2006, English winners heard Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, usually known as \"Land of Hope and Glory\",Anthem 4 England – At the 2010 Commonwealth games Blake and Parry's Jerusalem was used by the England team [http://anthem4england.co.uk/modules/news/article.php?storyid1 Land of Hope and Glory]  but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, \"Jerusalem\" was adopted as England's new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, \"God Save the Queen\" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.\n\nLyrics in the UK\n\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible.1 Samuel x. 24; 2 Samuel xvi. 16 and 2 Kings xi. 12 A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, \"...And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\".\"The Watchword in the Night shall be, 'God save King Henrye!' The other shall answer, 'Long to raign over Us!' He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse \"Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices\".\n\nIn 1745, The Gentleman's Magazine published \"God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices\", describing it \"As sung at both Playhouses\" (the Theatres Royal at Drury Lane and Covent Garden).The Gentleman's Magazine Vol. 15, October 1745, p.552 Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of King George II, after his defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans by the army of Charles Edward Stuart, son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the British throne.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word \"send\" in the line \"Send him victorious\" could imply that the king was absent. However, the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples of \"[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.\" meaning \"God grant that he may be safe, etc.\". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.\n\nScholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.Scholes p.412\n\nIn 1902, the musician William Hayman Cummings, quoting mid-18th century correspondence between Charles Burney and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the Chapel Royal.\n\nStandard version in the United Kingdom\n\nThere is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the \"standard\" British version, appearing not only in the 1745 Gentleman's Magazine, but also in publications such as The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century (1851), National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written (1861), Household Book of Poetry (1882), and Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version (1982).\n\nThe same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including Scouting for Boys (1908), and on the British Monarchy website. At the Queen's Golden Jubilee Party at the Palace concert, Prince Charles referred in his speech to the \"politically incorrect second verse\" of the National Anthem.\n\nAccording to Alan Michie's Rule, Britannia, which was published in 1952, after the death of King George VI but before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, when the first General Assembly of the United Nations was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, \"ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of 'God Save the King' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.\"\n\nIn the UK, the first verse is the only verse typically sung, even at official occasions, although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and usually at the Last Night of the Proms. At the Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the fourth verse of the William Hickson alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.\n\nStandard version of the music\n\nThe standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short crescendo into \"Send her victorious\", and then is another crescendo at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the Queen\".\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version, usually played in march time, in the higher key of B,Official versions published by Kneller Hall Royal Military School of Music because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.\n\nSince 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by Gordon Jacob for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAlternative British versions\n\nThere have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase \"scatter her enemies.\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her\" to \"our\"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted \"thine\" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford.Richards p.91 In 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative version\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal. The fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the Queen's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002 and during the raising of the Union Flag during the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nOfficial peace version\n\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book Songs of Praise in 1925. This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today. Source describes it as an \"unusual and little known version of the national anthem ... taken from the order of service for the blessing of Halesowen's borough charter ... on Sunday, 20 September 1936.\"\n\nHistoric alternative verses\n\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 Gentleman's Magazine. This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1822, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an \"additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung\", the lyrics given being:\n\nThe 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. \"A fourth verse was briefly in vogue at the time of the rebellion, but was rapidly abandoned thereafter: God grant that Marshal Wade...etc\"\"The history of God Save the King\": The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol 6 (new series), 1836, p.373.  \"There is an additional verse... though being of temporary application only, it was but short-lived...[but]...it was stored in the memory of an old friend of my own... 'Oh! grant that Marshal Wade... etc.' It was included as an integral part of the song in the Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse of 1926, although erroneously referencing the \"fourth verse\" to the Gentleman's Magazine article of 1745.\n\nOn the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:\n\nIn May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate King George III at London's Drury Lane theatre, playwright Richard Sheridan immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:\n\nVarious other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade's force and reached Derby, but then retreated and when their garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered to a second government army led by King George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, another verse was added. Note that the verse he quotes appears to have a line missing. Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book Handel by Edward J. Dent:See:[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9089 etext 9089 at project Gutenberg] and [http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Handel2/#p35 p35 at FullTextArchive.com]\n\nHowever, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century.Richards p.90. Updated \"full\" versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, Hickson's fourth verse, Sheridan's verse and the Marshal Wade verse.\n\nPerformance in the UK\n\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52.Percy A Scholes: Oxford Companion to Music, Tenth Edition, Oxford University Press In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality.  (This can be seen in the 1972 Dad's Army episode A Soldier's Farewell.)\n\nThe anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as Wimbledon, Royal Variety Performance, the Edinburgh Tattoo, Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and The Proms.\n\nThe anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the BBC, and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some ITV companies (with the notable exception of Granada). BBC Two never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on BBC One until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC1 began to simulcast with BBC News after end of programmes).  The tradition is carried on, however, by BBC Radio 4, which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio Four broadcasting and the move to BBC World Service. Radio 4 and Radio 2 also play the National Anthem at 0700 and 0800 on the actual and official birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe anthem usually prefaces The Queen's Christmas Message (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.\n\nOther British anthems\n\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at an international sporting event, for instance an alternative song is used:\n\n* England generally uses \"God Save the Queen\", but \"Jerusalem\", \"Rule, Britannia!\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" have also been used.[http://www.britannia.com/history/rulebrit.html Britannia History – Rule Britannia!] Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international test cricket matches, England has, since 2004, used \"Jerusalem\" as the anthem.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4217144.stm Sing Jerusalem for England!] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international rugby league matches, England uses \"God Save the Queen\" and also \"Jerusalem\".[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry Hubert Parry: The Composer – Icons of England]  Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international rugby union and football matches, England uses \"God Save the Queen\".[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4857268.stm Home nations fans 'back England'] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At the Commonwealth Games, Team England uses \"Jerusalem\" as their victory anthem.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9064469.stm Commonwealth Games 2010: England stars discuss Jerusalem] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n* Scotland uses \"Flower of Scotland\" as their anthem for most sporting occasions.[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/flower-of-scotland-1.568214 Flower of Scotland] The Herald (13 July 1990) Retrieved 26 February 2011 \n* Wales uses Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (\"Land of My Fathers\") for governmental ceremonies and sporting occasions.

An amendment (EDM 1319A3) was proposed by Evan Harris that the song \"should have a bit more oomph than God Save The Queen and should also not involve God.\"\n\nFor more information see also:\n* National anthem of England\n* National anthem of Scotland\n* Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\n* Londonderry Air\n\nUse in other Commonwealth countries\n\n\"God Save the King/Queen\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In some countries it remains as one of the official national anthems, such as in New Zealand, – Royal assent that the two songs should have equal status or as an official royal anthem, as is the case in Australia, Canada, Jamaica, and Tuvalu, to be played during formal ceremonies involving national royalty or vice-royalty.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn Australia, the song has standing through a Royal Proclamation issued by Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen on 19 April 1984.Commonwealth of Australia Gazette; No. S 142; 19 April 1984 It declared \"God Save the Queen\" to be the Royal Anthem and that it is to be played when the Australian monarch or a member of the Royal Family is present, though not exclusively in such circumstances. The same proclamation made \"Advance Australia Fair\" the national anthem and the basis for the \"Vice-Regal Salute\" (the first four and last two bars of the anthem). Prior to 1984, \"God Save the Queen\" was the national anthem of Australia.\n\nCanada\n\nBy convention, \"God Save the Queen\" is the Royal Anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups. The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the \"Viceregal Salute\", comprising the first three lines of \"God Save the Queen\", followed by the first and last lines of \"O Canada\".\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"God Save the Queen\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"O Canada\". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that \"God Save the Queen\", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and \"O Canada\" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for \"God Save the Queen\", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing \"O Canada\" as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding \"God Save the Queen\" were not included.\n\nThe Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces regulates that \"God Save the Queen\" be played as a salute to the monarch and other members of the Canadian Royal Family, though it may also be used as a hymn, or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented. Elizabeth II stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by pipe bands is Mallorca.\n\nLyrics in Canada\n\nThe first verse of \"God Save the Queen\" has been translated into French, as shown below:\nDieu protège la reine\nNotre gracieuse reine!\nVive la reine!\nQu'un règne glorieux\nLong et victorieux,\nRende son peuple heureux.\nVive la reine!\n\nThere is a special Canadian verse in English which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses:\nOur loved Dominion bless\nWith peace and happiness\nFrom shore to shore;\nAnd let our Empire be\nLoyal, united, free,\nTrue to herself and Thee\nFor evermore.\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was added as a second. \"God Save the Queen\" is now most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day.\n\nIn New Zealand, the second more militaristic verse is sometimes replaced with Hickson's verse \"Nor in this land alone...\" (often sung as \"Not in this land alone\"), otherwise known as a \"Commonwealth verse\".\n\nRhodesia\n\nWhen Rhodesia issued its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the UK on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations; \"God Save the Queen\" therefore remained the Rhodesian national anthem. This was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the Rhodesian people to the monarch, but the retention in Rhodesia of a song so associated with the UK while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused Rhodesian state occasions to have \"a faintly ironic tone\", in the words of The Times. Nevertheless, \"God Save the Queen\" remained Rhodesia's national anthem until March 1970, when the country formally declared itself a republic. \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" was adopted in its stead in 1974 and remained in use until the country returned to British control in December 1979. Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, \"God Save the Queen\" has had no official status there.\n\nUse elsewhere\n\n\"God Save the King\" was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem, only the Dutch Het Wilhelmus (~1568) is older. (The Spanish La Marcha Real is older as well, but took longer to become popular. Japan's anthem Kimigayo has lyrics which are older still, but a more recent melody). Its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune:\n\n* The Imperial anthem of Germany, Heil dir im Siegerkranz (originally the royal anthem of Prussia since 1795), used the melody of \"God Save the King\". In addition, several German states used the tune, including Bavaria (Heil unserm König, Heil! - Hail to our King, Hail!), Saxony (Gott segne Sachsenland - God bless Saxony) and Liechtenstein, which did not join the German Empire (see below). During the reign of Otto of Greece, the Bavarian royal anthem also served as the Greek anthem.\n* The anthem of the Kingdom of Hanover, Heil dir, Hannover, used the melody of \"God Save the King\". Hanover was in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain and subsequently the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1837.\n* The national anthem of Imperial Russia from 1816 to 1833 was Molitva russkikh (\"The Prayer of Russians\"), which used the melody of \"God Save the King\" and lyrics by Vasily Zhukovsky.[http://www.hymn.ru/index-en.html \"Russian Anthems museum\"]  \n* In Switzerland (Rufst Du, mein Vaterland or Ô monts indépendants, until 1961).\n* \"God Save the King\" was used as the national anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaii before 1860\n* E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua, from 1860 to 1886 the national anthem of Hawaii, was set to the same melody.\n* The American patriotic hymn \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", the lyrics of which were written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831. The song is often quoted – alongside \"Hail, Columbia\" – as a de facto national anthem for the United States, before the de jure adoption of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in 1931.\n* Norway's royal anthem Kongesangen uses the melody.\n* The Swedish royal anthem Bevare Gud vår kung between 1805 and 1880, used the melody.\n* Liechtenstein's anthem Oben am jungen Rhein uses the same melody. In consequence, the tune was played twice before a Euro 2004 qualifying match between England and Liechtenstein; and again before the Euro 96 qualifier between Northern Ireland and Liechtenstein. (When England plays Northern Ireland, the tune is only played once).\n* Iceland's de facto national anthem in the 19th century was Íslands minni (\"To Iceland\", better known as Eldgamla Ísafold), a poem by Bjarni Thorarensen set to the melody of \"God Save the King\". This lasted until the current national anthem was adopted, first by popular consent and later by law. The tune remains a popular one in Iceland and many different texts—serious, satirical and comical—have been set to it.\n\nThe melody is also used as a hymn tune by Christian churches in various countries, including by the United Methodists of the southern United States, Mexico, and Latin America, among other denominations. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110816030738/http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/g/g/o/ggodhigh.htm Glory to God on High]\" is frequently sung to the tune, as is \"[http://blog.daum.net/yhdvr/8905694 Since I Have My Retreat\"] in the Protestant Church of Korea, and the Dutch hymn \"Eeuwig en machtig Heer\".\n\nThe Ren & Stimpy Show uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the \"Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\".\n\nMusical adaptations\n\nClassical composers\n\nAbout 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions, including Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms, Clementi, J. C. Bach, Liszt, Britten, Carl Maria von Weber, Niccolò Paganini, Johann Strauss I, and Edward Elgar.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of \"God Save the King\", catalogued as WoO.78 (1802–1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work Wellington's Victory.\n\nMuzio Clementi used the theme to \"God Save the King\" in his Symphony No. 3 in G major, often called the \"Great National Symphony\", catalogued as WoO. 34. Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the Symphony (about 1816–1824) on \"God Save the King\", which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.\n• Symphony No. 3 \"Great National Symphony \" in en sol majeur/G-dur/G major/sol maggiore\n1. Andante sostenuto – Allegro con brio\n2. Andante un poco mosso\n3. Minuetto. Allegretto\n4. Finale. Vivace\n\nJohann Christian Bach composed a set of variations on \"God Save the King\" for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written c. 1763.\n\nJoseph Haydn was impressed by the use of \"God Save the King\" as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" (\"God Save Emperor Francis\") for the birthday of the last Holy Roman Emperor and Roman-German King, Francis II. It became the anthem of the Austrian Empire after the end of the Holy Roman Empire with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the German national anthem. The tune of \"God Save the King\" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\".\n\nFranz Liszt wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).\n\nJohann Strauss I quoted \"God Save the Queen\" in full at the end of his waltz Huldigung der Königin Victoria von Grossbritannien (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted Rule, Britannia! in full at the beginning of the piece.\n\nSiegfried August Mahlmann in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the Kingdom of Saxony, as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Bless Saxony\").\n\nHeinrich Marschner used the anthem in his \"Grande Ouverture solenne\", op.78 (1842).\n\nGaetano Donizetti used this anthem in his opera \"Roberto Devereux\".\n\nJoachim Raff used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.\n\nGioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his \"Il viaggio a Reims\", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings \"Della real pianta\" on the notes of \"God Save the King\". Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song.\n\nFernando Sor used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'\n\nArthur Sullivan quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet Victoria and Merrie England.\n\nClaude Debussy opens with a brief introduction of \"God Save the King\" in one of his Preludes, Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.. The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the Charles Dickens novel The Pickwick Papers.\n\nNiccolò Paganini wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on \"God Save the King\" as his Opus 9.\n\nMax Reger wrote Variations and Fugue on 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' (God Save the King) for organ in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria. It does not have an opus number.\n\nA week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 \"Coronation Gala Concert\" at Covent Garden (it was cancelled, owing to the King's illness), Sir Edward Elgar introduced an arrangement of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a \"Coronation Concert\" at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of a cappella and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George’s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir. Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short \"Civic Procession and Anthem\", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar resorted to reconstructing it by ear from the recording.Jerrold Northrop Moore, Edward Elgar, a Creative Life, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1987\n\nCarl Maria von Weber uses the \"God Save the King\" theme at the end of his \"Jubel Overture\"\n\nGiuseppe Verdi included \"God Save the Queen\" in his \"Inno delle nazioni\" (Hymn of the Nations), composed for the London 1862 International Exhibition.\n\nBenjamin Britten arranged \"God Save the Queen\" in 1961 for the Leeds Festival. This version has been programmed several times at the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nCharles Ives wrote Variations on \"America\" for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because \"it made the boys laugh out loud\". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was \"almost as much fun as playing baseball\". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by William Schuman. This version became popular during the bicentennial celebrations, and is often heard at pops concerts.\n\nMuthuswami Dikshitar (1776–1835), one of the musical trinity in South Indian classical (Carnatic) music composed some Sanskrit pieces set to Western tunes. These are in the raga Sankarabharanam and are referred to as \"nottu swaras\". Among these, the composition \"Santatam Pahimam Sangita Shyamale\" is set to the tune of \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nSigismond Thalberg (1812-1871), Swiss composer and one of the most famous virtuoso pianists of the 19th century, wrote a fantasia on \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nJohan Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) wrote the Variations from God Save the King in D major, op. 10.\n\nAdrien-François Servais (1807–66) and Joseph Ghys (1801–48) wrote Variations brillantes et concertantes sur l'air \"God Save the King\", op. 38, for violin and cello and performed it in London and St Petersburg.\n\nGeorges Onslow (1784-1853) used the tune in his String Quartet No. 7 in G Minor, op.9, second movement.\n\nReligious Adaptations\n\nA nineteenth-century convert to Islam and leading Islamic scholar in the UK at the time wrote an Islamic adaptation to what was \"God Save The King.\"\n\nA MUSLIM ANTHEM by Abdullah Quilliam\n\nTune – “God Save the Queen/King”\n\nGod bless the Muslim cause: \nBless all who keep Thy laws And do the right. \nUphold the Muslim band, In this and every land; \nGive them full strength to stand Firm in the fight. \nStrengthen and help the weak, And teach us all to speak, Thy truth abound. \nMay love and liberty, Truth and sweet purity, With plenteous charity, In us be found. \nHear Thou the orphan's cry, Assuage the widow's sigh, The foolish chide. \nLet vice no more abound, But happiness be found In every home and round The world so wide.\n\n1st Muharram, 1319\n21 April 1901.\n\nRock adaptations\n\nThe British rock band Family sampled \"God Save the Queen\" at the end of their 1968 debut album, Music in a Doll's House, following the final track, \"3 x Time\".\n\nThe Beatles performed an impromptu version of \"God Save the Queen\" during their 30 January 1969 rooftop concert, atop the Apple building.Cross, Craig (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?idFHdnkXJK2e4C&pg\nPA212&dqrooftop%20concert%20-%20the%20beatles%20-%20god%20save%20the%20queen&hl\nen&eifThpTf-SGtSbhQfXyKzsDg&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum3&ved\n0CDoQ6AEwAg#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Beatles-Discography.com: Day-By-Day Song-By-Song Record-By-Record] p.212. iUniverse, 2004.

    "aggregatedText" : "\"God Save the Queen\" (alternatively \"God Save the King\", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is the national or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown Dependencies. The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.\n\nIt is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem – played specifically in the presence of the monarch – of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of \"God Save the Queen\" has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. In the United States, the melody is used for the patriotic song \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\". The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, \"Oben am jungen Rhein\".\n\nBeyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders.cf. the versions in the hymn books English Hymnal, Hymns Ancient and Modern, and Songs of Praise In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung, and on rare occasions, three.\n\nThe sovereign and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire anthem, while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of \"God Save the Queen\" followed by the first four and last four bars of \"O Canada\"), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.\n\nHistory\n\nIn The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to \"God Save the King/Queen\". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see musica ficta). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, set to the words \"God Save the King\". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, \"Remember O Thou Man\" was the source of the tune.\n\nThe first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman's Magazine (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nScholes' analysis includes mention of \"untenable\" and \"doubtful\" claims, as well as \"an American misattribution\". Some of these are:\n* The French Marquise de Créquy wrote in her Souvenirs that the words \"Grand Dieu, sauvez le Roi!\" were indeed composed by Jean-Baptiste Lully in gratitude for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation. (The surgical knife purpose-made for the occasion is on display in the Musée d'histoire de la médecine.) Allegedly, Lully had set words by Marie de Brinon to music, and Créquy claimed that the tune was later plagiarised by Handel, and so adopted by the British as \"un de leurs air nationaux\". (The entire story might have been intended as a joke.) Translated into Latin under the title Domine, Salvum Fac Regem, it became the French anthem until 1792.See the sheet music available online:  After the Battle of Culloden, the Hanover dynasty supposedly adopted this melody as the British anthem.\n* James Oswald was a possible author of the Thesaurus Musicus, so may have played a part in the history of the song, but is not a strong enough candidate to be cited as the composer of the tune.\n* Dr Henry Carey: Scholes refutes this attribution: first on the grounds that Carey himself never made such a claim; second, when the claim was made by Carey's son (in 1795), it was in support of a request for a pension from the British Government; and third, the younger Carey claimed that his father, who died in 1743, had written parts of the song in 1745. It has also been claimed that the work was first publicly performed by Carey during a dinner in 1740 in honour of Admiral Edward \"Grog\" Vernon, who had captured the Spanish harbour of Porto Bello (then in Gran Colombia, now in Panamá) during the War of Jenkins' Ear.\n\nScholes recommends the attribution \"traditional\" or \"traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562–1628)\". The English Hymnal (musical editor Ralph Vaughan Williams) gives no attribution, stating merely \"17th or 18th cent.\"Hymn No. 560 \"National Anthem\"\n\nOriginal lyrics \n\nGod save great George our king\nGod save our noble king,\nGod save the king!\nSend him victorious\nHappy and glorious\nLong to reign over us\nGod save the king!\n\nUse in the United Kingdom\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. In general only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions three.  The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the Queen\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.\n\nEngland has no official national anthem of its own; \"God Save the Queen\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where Jerusalem is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry's \"Jerusalem\" and Elgar's \"Land of Hope and Glory\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football, rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently. On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \"Scotland the Brave\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \"Flower of Scotland\" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, \"God Save the Queen\" is still used as the official anthem.\n\nThe phrase \"No surrender\" is occasionally sung in the bridge before \"Send her victorious\" by England football fans at matches. The phrase \"no surrender\" is also associated with Combat 18, a white supremacist group. The phrase is also associated with Ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.\n\nSince 2003, \"God Save the Queen\", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the \"Londonderry Air\", popularly known as \"Danny Boy\". In 2006, English winners heard Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, usually known as \"Land of Hope and Glory\",Anthem 4 England – At the 2010 Commonwealth games Blake and Parry's Jerusalem was used by the England team [http://anthem4england.co.uk/modules/news/article.php?storyid1 Land of Hope and Glory]  but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, \"Jerusalem\" was adopted as England's new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, \"God Save the Queen\" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.\n\nLyrics in the UK\n\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible.1 Samuel x. 24; 2 Samuel xvi. 16 and 2 Kings xi. 12 A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, \"...And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\".\"The Watchword in the Night shall be, 'God save King Henrye!' The other shall answer, 'Long to raign over Us!' He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse \"Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices\".\n\nIn 1745, The Gentleman's Magazine published \"God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices\", describing it \"As sung at both Playhouses\" (the Theatres Royal at Drury Lane and Covent Garden).The Gentleman's Magazine Vol. 15, October 1745, p.552 Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of King George II, after his defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans by the army of Charles Edward Stuart, son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the British throne.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word \"send\" in the line \"Send him victorious\" could imply that the king was absent. However, the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples of \"[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.\" meaning \"God grant that he may be safe, etc.\". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.\n\nScholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.Scholes p.412\n\nIn 1902, the musician William Hayman Cummings, quoting mid-18th century correspondence between Charles Burney and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the Chapel Royal.\n\nStandard version in the United Kingdom\n\nThere is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the \"standard\" British version, appearing not only in the 1745 Gentleman's Magazine, but also in publications such as The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century (1851), National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written (1861), Household Book of Poetry (1882), and Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version (1982).\n\nThe same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including Scouting for Boys (1908), and on the British Monarchy website. At the Queen's Golden Jubilee Party at the Palace concert, Prince Charles referred in his speech to the \"politically incorrect second verse\" of the National Anthem.\n\nAccording to Alan Michie's Rule, Britannia, which was published in 1952, after the death of King George VI but before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, when the first General Assembly of the United Nations was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, \"ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of 'God Save the King' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.\"\n\nIn the UK, the first verse is the only verse typically sung, even at official occasions, although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and usually at the Last Night of the Proms. At the Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the fourth verse of the William Hickson alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.\n\nStandard version of the music\n\nThe standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short crescendo into \"Send her victorious\", and then is another crescendo at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the Queen\".\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version, usually played in march time, in the higher key of B,Official versions published by Kneller Hall Royal Military School of Music because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.\n\nSince 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by Gordon Jacob for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAlternative British versions\n\nThere have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase \"scatter her enemies.\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her\" to \"our\"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted \"thine\" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford.Richards p.91 In 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative version\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal. The fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the Queen's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002 and during the raising of the Union Flag during the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nOfficial peace version\n\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book Songs of Praise in 1925. This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today. Source describes it as an \"unusual and little known version of the national anthem ... taken from the order of service for the blessing of Halesowen's borough charter ... on Sunday, 20 September 1936.\"\n\nHistoric alternative verses\n\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 Gentleman's Magazine. This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1822, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an \"additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung\", the lyrics given being:\n\nThe 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. \"A fourth verse was briefly in vogue at the time of the rebellion, but was rapidly abandoned thereafter: God grant that Marshal Wade...etc\"\"The history of God Save the King\": The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol 6 (new series), 1836, p.373.  \"There is an additional verse... though being of temporary application only, it was but short-lived...[but]...it was stored in the memory of an old friend of my own... 'Oh! grant that Marshal Wade... etc.' It was included as an integral part of the song in the Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse of 1926, although erroneously referencing the \"fourth verse\" to the Gentleman's Magazine article of 1745.\n\nOn the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:\n\nIn May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate King George III at London's Drury Lane theatre, playwright Richard Sheridan immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:\n\nVarious other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade's force and reached Derby, but then retreated and when their garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered to a second government army led by King George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, another verse was added. Note that the verse he quotes appears to have a line missing. Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book Handel by Edward J. Dent:See:[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9089 etext 9089 at project Gutenberg] and [http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Handel2/#p35 p35 at FullTextArchive.com]\n\nHowever, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century.Richards p.90. Updated \"full\" versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, Hickson's fourth verse, Sheridan's verse and the Marshal Wade verse.\n\nPerformance in the UK\n\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52.Percy A Scholes: Oxford Companion to Music, Tenth Edition, Oxford University Press In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality.  (This can be seen in the 1972 Dad's Army episode A Soldier's Farewell.)\n\nThe anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as Wimbledon, Royal Variety Performance, the Edinburgh Tattoo, Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and The Proms.\n\nThe anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the BBC, and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some ITV companies (with the notable exception of Granada). BBC Two never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on BBC One until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC1 began to simulcast with BBC News after end of programmes).  The tradition is carried on, however, by BBC Radio 4, which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio Four broadcasting and the move to BBC World Service. Radio 4 and Radio 2 also play the National Anthem at 0700 and 0800 on the actual and official birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe anthem usually prefaces The Queen's Christmas Message (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.\n\nOther British anthems\n\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at an international sporting event, for instance an alternative song is used:\n\n* England generally uses \"God Save the Queen\", but \"Jerusalem\", \"Rule, Britannia!\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" have also been used.[http://www.britannia.com/history/rulebrit.html Britannia History – Rule Britannia!] Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international test cricket matches, England has, since 2004, used \"Jerusalem\" as the anthem.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4217144.stm Sing Jerusalem for England!] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international rugby league matches, England uses \"God Save the Queen\" and also \"Jerusalem\".[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry Hubert Parry: The Composer – Icons of England]  Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At international rugby union and football matches, England uses \"God Save the Queen\".[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4857268.stm Home nations fans 'back England'] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n** At the Commonwealth Games, Team England uses \"Jerusalem\" as their victory anthem.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9064469.stm Commonwealth Games 2010: England stars discuss Jerusalem] BBC Sport Retrieved 26 February 2011\n* Scotland uses \"Flower of Scotland\" as their anthem for most sporting occasions.[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/flower-of-scotland-1.568214 Flower of Scotland] The Herald (13 July 1990) Retrieved 26 February 2011 \n* Wales uses Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (\"Land of My Fathers\") for governmental ceremonies and sporting occasions.

An amendment (EDM 1319A3) was proposed by Evan Harris that the song \"should have a bit more oomph than God Save The Queen and should also not involve God.\"\n\nFor more information see also:\n* National anthem of England\n* National anthem of Scotland\n* Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\n* Londonderry Air\n\nUse in other Commonwealth countries\n\n\"God Save the King/Queen\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In some countries it remains as one of the official national anthems, such as in New Zealand, – Royal assent that the two songs should have equal status or as an official royal anthem, as is the case in Australia, Canada, Jamaica, and Tuvalu, to be played during formal ceremonies involving national royalty or vice-royalty.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn Australia, the song has standing through a Royal Proclamation issued by Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen on 19 April 1984.Commonwealth of Australia Gazette; No. S 142; 19 April 1984 It declared \"God Save the Queen\" to be the Royal Anthem and that it is to be played when the Australian monarch or a member of the Royal Family is present, though not exclusively in such circumstances. The same proclamation made \"Advance Australia Fair\" the national anthem and the basis for the \"Vice-Regal Salute\" (the first four and last two bars of the anthem). Prior to 1984, \"God Save the Queen\" was the national anthem of Australia.\n\nCanada\n\nBy convention, \"God Save the Queen\" is the Royal Anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups. The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the \"Viceregal Salute\", comprising the first three lines of \"God Save the Queen\", followed by the first and last lines of \"O Canada\".\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"God Save the Queen\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"O Canada\". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that \"God Save the Queen\", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and \"O Canada\" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for \"God Save the Queen\", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing \"O Canada\" as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding \"God Save the Queen\" were not included.\n\nThe Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces regulates that \"God Save the Queen\" be played as a salute to the monarch and other members of the Canadian Royal Family, though it may also be used as a hymn, or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented. Elizabeth II stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by pipe bands is Mallorca.\n\nLyrics in Canada\n\nThe first verse of \"God Save the Queen\" has been translated into French, as shown below:\nDieu protège la reine\nNotre gracieuse reine!\nVive la reine!\nQu'un règne glorieux\nLong et victorieux,\nRende son peuple heureux.\nVive la reine!\n\nThere is a special Canadian verse in English which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses:\nOur loved Dominion bless\nWith peace and happiness\nFrom shore to shore;\nAnd let our Empire be\nLoyal, united, free,\nTrue to herself and Thee\nFor evermore.\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was added as a second. \"God Save the Queen\" is now most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day.\n\nIn New Zealand, the second more militaristic verse is sometimes replaced with Hickson's verse \"Nor in this land alone...\" (often sung as \"Not in this land alone\"), otherwise known as a \"Commonwealth verse\".\n\nRhodesia\n\nWhen Rhodesia issued its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the UK on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations; \"God Save the Queen\" therefore remained the Rhodesian national anthem. This was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the Rhodesian people to the monarch, but the retention in Rhodesia of a song so associated with the UK while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused Rhodesian state occasions to have \"a faintly ironic tone\", in the words of The Times. Nevertheless, \"God Save the Queen\" remained Rhodesia's national anthem until March 1970, when the country formally declared itself a republic. \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" was adopted in its stead in 1974 and remained in use until the country returned to British control in December 1979. Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, \"God Save the Queen\" has had no official status there.\n\nUse elsewhere\n\n\"God Save the King\" was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem, only the Dutch Het Wilhelmus (~1568) is older. (The Spanish La Marcha Real is older as well, but took longer to become popular. Japan's anthem Kimigayo has lyrics which are older still, but a more recent melody). Its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune:\n\n* The Imperial anthem of Germany, Heil dir im Siegerkranz (originally the royal anthem of Prussia since 1795), used the melody of \"God Save the King\". In addition, several German states used the tune, including Bavaria (Heil unserm König, Heil! - Hail to our King, Hail!), Saxony (Gott segne Sachsenland - God bless Saxony) and Liechtenstein, which did not join the German Empire (see below). During the reign of Otto of Greece, the Bavarian royal anthem also served as the Greek anthem.\n* The anthem of the Kingdom of Hanover, Heil dir, Hannover, used the melody of \"God Save the King\". Hanover was in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain and subsequently the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1837.\n* The national anthem of Imperial Russia from 1816 to 1833 was Molitva russkikh (\"The Prayer of Russians\"), which used the melody of \"God Save the King\" and lyrics by Vasily Zhukovsky.[http://www.hymn.ru/index-en.html \"Russian Anthems museum\"]  \n* In Switzerland (Rufst Du, mein Vaterland or Ô monts indépendants, until 1961).\n* \"God Save the King\" was used as the national anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaii before 1860\n* E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua, from 1860 to 1886 the national anthem of Hawaii, was set to the same melody.\n* The American patriotic hymn \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", the lyrics of which were written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831. The song is often quoted – alongside \"Hail, Columbia\" – as a de facto national anthem for the United States, before the de jure adoption of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in 1931.\n* Norway's royal anthem Kongesangen uses the melody.\n* The Swedish royal anthem Bevare Gud vår kung between 1805 and 1880, used the melody.\n* Liechtenstein's anthem Oben am jungen Rhein uses the same melody. In consequence, the tune was played twice before a Euro 2004 qualifying match between England and Liechtenstein; and again before the Euro 96 qualifier between Northern Ireland and Liechtenstein. (When England plays Northern Ireland, the tune is only played once).\n* Iceland's de facto national anthem in the 19th century was Íslands minni (\"To Iceland\", better known as Eldgamla Ísafold), a poem by Bjarni Thorarensen set to the melody of \"God Save the King\". This lasted until the current national anthem was adopted, first by popular consent and later by law. The tune remains a popular one in Iceland and many different texts—serious, satirical and comical—have been set to it.\n\nThe melody is also used as a hymn tune by Christian churches in various countries, including by the United Methodists of the southern United States, Mexico, and Latin America, among other denominations. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110816030738/http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/g/g/o/ggodhigh.htm Glory to God on High]\" is frequently sung to the tune, as is \"[http://blog.daum.net/yhdvr/8905694 Since I Have My Retreat\"] in the Protestant Church of Korea, and the Dutch hymn \"Eeuwig en machtig Heer\".\n\nThe Ren & Stimpy Show uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the \"Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\".\n\nMusical adaptations\n\nClassical composers\n\nAbout 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions, including Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms, Clementi, J. C. Bach, Liszt, Britten, Carl Maria von Weber, Niccolò Paganini, Johann Strauss I, and Edward Elgar.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of \"God Save the King\", catalogued as WoO.78 (1802–1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work Wellington's Victory.\n\nMuzio Clementi used the theme to \"God Save the King\" in his Symphony No. 3 in G major, often called the \"Great National Symphony\", catalogued as WoO. 34. Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the Symphony (about 1816–1824) on \"God Save the King\", which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.\n• Symphony No. 3 \"Great National Symphony \" in en sol majeur/G-dur/G major/sol maggiore\n1. Andante sostenuto – Allegro con brio\n2. Andante un poco mosso\n3. Minuetto. Allegretto\n4. Finale. Vivace\n\nJohann Christian Bach composed a set of variations on \"God Save the King\" for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written c. 1763.\n\nJoseph Haydn was impressed by the use of \"God Save the King\" as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" (\"God Save Emperor Francis\") for the birthday of the last Holy Roman Emperor and Roman-German King, Francis II. It became the anthem of the Austrian Empire after the end of the Holy Roman Empire with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the German national anthem. The tune of \"God Save the King\" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\".\n\nFranz Liszt wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).\n\nJohann Strauss I quoted \"God Save the Queen\" in full at the end of his waltz Huldigung der Königin Victoria von Grossbritannien (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted Rule, Britannia! in full at the beginning of the piece.\n\nSiegfried August Mahlmann in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the Kingdom of Saxony, as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Bless Saxony\").\n\nHeinrich Marschner used the anthem in his \"Grande Ouverture solenne\", op.78 (1842).\n\nGaetano Donizetti used this anthem in his opera \"Roberto Devereux\".\n\nJoachim Raff used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.\n\nGioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his \"Il viaggio a Reims\", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings \"Della real pianta\" on the notes of \"God Save the King\". Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song.\n\nFernando Sor used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'\n\nArthur Sullivan quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet Victoria and Merrie England.\n\nClaude Debussy opens with a brief introduction of \"God Save the King\" in one of his Preludes, Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.. The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the Charles Dickens novel The Pickwick Papers.\n\nNiccolò Paganini wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on \"God Save the King\" as his Opus 9.\n\nMax Reger wrote Variations and Fugue on 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' (God Save the King) for organ in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria. It does not have an opus number.\n\nA week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 \"Coronation Gala Concert\" at Covent Garden (it was cancelled, owing to the King's illness), Sir Edward Elgar introduced an arrangement of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a \"Coronation Concert\" at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of a cappella and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George’s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir. Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short \"Civic Procession and Anthem\", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar resorted to reconstructing it by ear from the recording.Jerrold Northrop Moore, Edward Elgar, a Creative Life, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1987\n\nCarl Maria von Weber uses the \"God Save the King\" theme at the end of his \"Jubel Overture\"\n\nGiuseppe Verdi included \"God Save the Queen\" in his \"Inno delle nazioni\" (Hymn of the Nations), composed for the London 1862 International Exhibition.\n\nBenjamin Britten arranged \"God Save the Queen\" in 1961 for the Leeds Festival. This version has been programmed several times at the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nCharles Ives wrote Variations on \"America\" for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because \"it made the boys laugh out loud\". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was \"almost as much fun as playing baseball\". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by William Schuman.
