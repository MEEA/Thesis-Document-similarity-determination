  "textBody" : "Ernest Howard Shepard OBE, MC (10 December 1879 – 24 March 1976) was an English artist and book illustrator. He is known especially for illustrations of the anthropomorphic soft toy and animal characters in The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie-the-Pooh by A. A. Milne.\n\nCareer \n\nShepard was born in St John's Wood, London. Having shown some promise in drawing at St Paul's School, in 1897 he enrolled in the Heatherley School of Fine Art in Chelsea. After a productive year there, he attended the Royal Academy Schools, winning a Landseer scholarship in 1899 and a British Institute prize in 1900.Chandler (2000), p. 33. There he met Florence Eleanor Chaplin, who he married in 1904.Chandler (2000), p. 37. By 1906 Shepard had become a successful illustrator, having produced work for illustrated editions of Aesop's Fables, David Copperfield, and Tom Brown's Schooldays, while at the same time working as an illustrator on the staff of Punch.Chandler (2000), p. 51. The couple bought a house in London, but in 1905 moved to Shamley Green, near Guildford.\n\nShepard was a prolific painter, showing in a number of major exhibitions. He exhibited at the Royal Society of Artists, Birmingham—a traditional venue for generic painters—as well as in the more radical atmosphere of Glasgow's Institute of Fine Arts, where some of the most innovative artists were on show. He was twice an exhibitor at the prestigious Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, one of the largest and most important provincial galleries in the country, and another at the Manchester Art Gallery, a Victorian institution now part of the public libraries. But at heart, Shepard was a Londoner, showing sixteen times at the Royal Academy on Piccadilly. His wife, who was also a painter, found a home in London's West End venue for her own modest output during a 25-year career.Johnson and Greutzner, p. 457.\n\nAlthough in his mid-thirties when World War I broke out in 1914, Shepard received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, an arm of the Royal Artillery.Chandler (2000), p. 59. By 1916, Shepard started working for the Intelligence Department sketching the combat area within the view of his battery position.Chandler (2000), p. 69. On 16 February 1917, he was made an acting captain whilst second-in-command of a siege battery, and briefly served as an acting major in late April and early May of that year, when he reverted to the acting rank of captain. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Whilst acting as Captain, he was awarded the Military Cross for his service at the Battle of Passchendaele. His citation read:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. As forward Observation Officer he continued to observe and send back valuable information, in spite of heavy shell and machine gun fire. His courage and coolness were conspicuous.\n\nBy war's end, he had achieved the rank of major.Bryant, Mark. World War I in Cartoons. London: Grub Street Pub, 2006, page 9, .\n\nThroughout the war he had been contributing to Punch. He was hired as a regular staff cartoonist in 1921 and became lead cartoonist in 1945. He was removed from this post in 1953 by Punchs new editor, Malcolm Muggeridge.\n\nShepard was recommended to A. A. Milne in 1923 by another Punch staffer, E. V. Lucas. Milne initially thought Shepard's style was not what he wanted, but used him to illustrate the book of poems When We Were Very Young. Happy with the results, Milne then insisted Shepard illustrate Winnie-the-Pooh. Realising his illustrator's contribution to the book's success, the writer arranged for Shepard to receive a share of his royalties. Milne also inscribed a copy of Winnie-the-Pooh with the following personal verse:\n\nWhen I am gone,\nLet Shepard decorate my tomb,\nAnd put (if there is room)\nTwo pictures on the stone:\nPiglet from page a hundred and eleven,\nAnd Pooh and Piglet walking (157) ...\nAnd Peter, thinking that they are my own,\nWill welcome me to Heaven.\n\nEventually Shepard came to resent \"that silly old bear\" as he felt that the Pooh illustrations overshadowed his other work.\n\nShepard modelled Pooh not on the toy owned by Milne's son Christopher Robin but on \"Growler\", a stuffed bear owned by his own son. With sketch based on Growler. (Growler no longer exists, having been given to his granddaughter Minnie Hunt and subsequently destroyed by a neighbour's dog.)Chandler (2000), p. 92. His Pooh work is so famous that 300 of his preliminary sketches were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1969, when he was 90 years old.\n\nA Shepard painting of Winnie the Pooh, believed to have been painted in the 1930s for a Bristol teashop, is the only known oil painting of the famous teddy bear. It was purchased at an auction for $243,000 in London late in 2000. The painting is displayed in the Pavilion Gallery at Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nShepard wrote two autobiographies: Drawn from Memory (1957) and Drawn From Life (1961).\n\nIn 1972, Shepard gave his personal collection of papers and illustrations to the University of Surrey. These now form the E.H. Shepard Archive.\n\nShepard was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nPersonal life \n\nShepard lived at Melina Place in St John's Wood and from 1955 in Lodsworth, West Sussex. He and Florence had two children, Graham (born 1907) and Mary (born 1909), who both became illustrators. Lt. Graham Shepard died when his ship HMS Polyanthus was sunk by German submarine U-952 in September 1943. Mary married E.V. Knox, the editor of Punch, and became known as the illustrator of the Mary Poppins series of children's books. Florence Shepard died in 1927. In November 1943 Shepard married Norah Carroll, a nurse at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. They remained married until his death in 1976.\n\nWorks illustrated \n\n* 1924 – When We Were Very YoungChandler (2000), pp. 172–174.\n* 1925 – Playtime and Company; Holly Tree\n* 1926 – Winnie The Pooh; Everybody's Pepys\n* 1927 – Jeremy; Little One's Log; Let's Pretend; Now We Are Six; Fun and Fantasy\n* 1928 – The House at Pooh Corner; The Golden Age\n* 1930 – Everybody's Boswell; Dream Days\n* 1931 – The Wind in the Willows; Christmas Poems; Bevis; Mother Goose\n* 1932 – Sycamore Square\n* 1933 – Everybody's Lamb; The Cricket in the Cage\n* 1934 – Victoria Regina\n* 1935 – Perfume from Provence\n* 1936 – The Modern Struwwelpeter\n* 1937 – Golden Sovereign; Cheddar Gorge; As the Bee Sucks; Sunset House: More Perfume from Provence\n* 1939 – The Reluctant Dragon\n* 1941 – Gracious Majesty\n* 1948 – Golden Age; Dream Days; Bertie's Escapade\n* 1949 – York\n* 1950 – Drover's Tale\n* 1951 – Enter David Garrick\n* 1953 – Silver Curlew\n* 1954 – Cuckoo Clock; Susan, Bill and the Wolf-dog\n* 1955 – Glass Slipper; Operation Wild Goose; Crystal Mountain; Frogmorton; The Brownies\n* 1955 – Mary in the Country\n* 1956 – The Islanders; The Pancake\n* 1956 – The Secret Garden\n* 1956 – Royal Reflections: Stories for Children\n* 1957 – Drawn from Memory; Briar Rose\n* 1958 – Old Greek Fairy Tales\n* 1959 – Tom Brown's School Days\n* 1960 – Noble Company\n* 1961 – Drawn from Life; Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales\n* 1965 – Ben and Brock\n* 1969 – The Wind in the Willows (colour re-illustration); The Pooh Cookbook (cover)\n* 1970 – Winnie the Pooh (colour re-illustration); The House at Pooh Corner (colour re-illustration)\n* 1971 – The Pooh Party Book (cover)",
