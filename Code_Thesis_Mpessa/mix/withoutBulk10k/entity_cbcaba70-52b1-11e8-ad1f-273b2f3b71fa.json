  "textBody" : "Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, commonly used as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities. It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as Cadra calidella—in laboratory experiments working with C. calidella, many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.P.D. Cox (1975). The influence of photoperiod on the life-cycles of Ephestia calidella (Guenee) and Ephestia figulilella Gregson (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae).—J. stored Prod. Res. 11(2), 77.\n\nDuring sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called δ-endotoxins, that have insecticidal action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using Bt genes, such as Bt corn. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal properties.\n\nTaxonomy and discovery\n\nB. thuringiensis was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese biologist  in silkworms. He named it Bacillus sotto, using the Japanese word , here referring to bacillary paralysis.\nIn 1911, German microbiologist Ernst Berliner independently rediscovered it when he isolated it as the cause of a disease called ' in flour moth caterpillars in Thuringia (hence the specific name thuringiensis, \"Thuringian\"). \nB. sotto would later be reassigned as B. thuringiensis var. sotto.\n\nIn 1976, Robert A. Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of B. thuringiensis and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation. B. thuringiensis is closely related to B. cereus, a soil bacterium, and B. anthracis, the cause of anthrax; the three organisms differ mainly in their plasmids.Ole Andreas Økstad and Anne-Brit Kolstø [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-7686-4_2#page-1 Chapter 2: Genomics of Bacillus Species] in M.

Subspecies commonly used as insecticides include Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk) and subspecies israelensis (Bti) and subspecies aizawa (Bta).\n\nMechanism of insecticidal action\n\nUpon sporulation, B. thuringiensis forms crystals of  proteinaceous insecticidal δ-endotoxins (called crystal proteins or Cry proteins), which are encoded by cry genes. In most strains of B. thuringiensis, the cry genes are located on a plasmid (cry is not a chromosomal gene in most strains).\n\nCry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies) and against nematodes. Thus, B. thuringiensis serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant genetically modified crops. When insects ingest toxin crystals, their alkaline digestive tracts denature the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus amenable to being cut with proteases found in the insect gut, which liberate the toxin from the crystal. The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore.W.S. Cranshaw, Colorado State University Extension Office.

While the target pests are exposed to the toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, Cry proteins are also expressed in other parts of the plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.Fearing, P.L., Brown, D., Vlachos, D., Meghji, M., L. Privalle. 1997. Quantitative analysis of Cry1A(b) expression in Bt maize plants, tissues, and silage and stability of expression over generations. Mol. Breed. 3:169-176.\n\nToxicology studies\n\nAnimal models have been used to assess human health risk from consumption of products containing Cry proteins. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes mouse acute oral feeding studies where doses as high as 5,000 mg/kg body weight resulted in no observed adverse effects.US EPA. 2001. [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/bt_brad2/2-id_health.pdf Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants October 15, 2001 Biopesticides Registration Action Document] Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that toxicity occurs at much lower doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals. The results of toxicology studies are further strengthened by the lack of observed toxicity from decades of use of B. thuringiensis and its crystalline proteins as an insecticidal spray.\n\nAllergenicity studies\n\nIntroduction of a new protein raised concerns regarding the potential for allergic responses in sensitive individuals. Bioinformatic analysis of known allergens has indicated there is no concern of allergic reactions as a result of consumption of Bt toxins. Additionally, skin prick testing using purified Bt protein resulted in no detectable production of toxin-specific IgE antibodies, even in atopic patients.\n\nDigestibility studies\n\nStudies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods. Bt toxin proteins have been shown to digest within minutes of exposure to simulated gastric fluids. The instability of the proteins in digestive fluids is an additional indication that Cry proteins are unlikely to be allergenic, since most known food allergens resist degradation and are ultimately absorbed in the small intestine.\n\nEcological risk assessment\n\nEcological risk assessment aims to ensure there is no unintended impact on non-target organisms and no contamination of natural resources as a result of the use of a new substance, such as the use of Bt in genetically-modified crops. The impact of Bt toxins on the environments where transgenic plants are grown has been evaluated to ensure no adverse effects outside of targeted crop pests.US EPA. 2001. Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants Biopesticides Registration Action Document [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/1-overview.pdf]\n\nPersistence in environment\n\nConcerns over possible environmental impact from accumulation of Bt toxins from plant tissues, pollen dispersal, and direct secretion from roots have been investigated. Bt toxins may persist in soil for over 200 days, with half-lives between 1.6 and 22 days. Much of the toxin is initially degraded rapidly by microorganisms in the environment, while some is adsorbed by organic matter and persists longer. Some studies, in contrast, claim that the toxins do not persist in the soil. Bt toxins are less likely to accumulate in bodies of water, but pollen shed or soil runoff may deposit them in an aquatic ecosystem. Fish species are not susceptible to Bt toxins if exposed.\n\nImpact on non-target organisms\n\nThe toxic nature of Bt proteins has an adverse impact on many major crop pests, but ecological risk assessments have been conducted to ensure safety of beneficial non-target organisms that may come into contact with the toxins. Widespread concerns over toxicity in non-target lepidopterans, such as the monarch butterfly, have been disproved through proper exposure characterization, where it was determined that non-target organisms are not exposed to high enough amounts of the Bt toxins to have an adverse effect on the population. Soil-dwelling organisms, potentially exposed to Bt toxins through root exudates, are not impacted by the growth of Bt crops.\n\nInsect resistance\n\nMultiple insects have developed a resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis. In November 2009, Monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to the first-generation Bt cotton in parts of Gujarat, India - that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Monsanto responded by introducing a second-generation cotton with multiple Bt proteins, which was rapidly adopted. Bollworm resistance to first-generation Bt cotton was also identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States.\nAdditionally, the Indian mealmoth, a common grain pest, is also developing a resistance since Bacillus thuringiensis has been extensively used as a biological control agent against the moth. Studies in the cabbage looper have suggested that a mutation in the membrane transporter ABCC2 can confer resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis.\n\nSecondary pests\n\nSeveral studies have documented surges in \"sucking pests\" (which are not affected by Bt toxins) within a few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with mirids, which have in some cases \"completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation\". The increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.  Another study in five provinces in China found the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars is significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by recent studies that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging secondary pests, such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.; Erratum published 2012 Aug 5: \n\nSimilar problems have been reported in India, with both mealy bugsBhaskar Goswami, InfoChange\n[http://infochangeindia.org/200709026463/Other/Features/Making-a-meal-of-Bt-cotton.html \"Making a meal of Bt cotton\"] Retrieved on 2009-4-6India Times\n[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/Economy/Agriculture/Bug_makes_meal_of_Punjab_cotton_whither_Bt_magic/articleshow/msid-2330585,curpg-1.cms \"Bug makes meal of Punjab cotton, whither Bt magic?\"] Retrieved on 2009-4-6 and aphids although a survey of small Indian farms between 2002 and 2008 concluded Bt cotton adoption has led to higher yields and lower pesticide use, decreasing over time.\n\nControversies\n\nThere are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.Staff, Frontline. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/viewpoints/ Harvest of Fear: Viewpoints] There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.\n\nLepidopteran toxicity\n\nThe most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the monarch butterfly. The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had asserted that \"the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields.\"Emily Waltz for Nature News. September 2, 2009 [http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html GM crops: Battlefield] Nature 461, 27-32 (2009) Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis has been widely used for controlling Spodoptera littoralis larvae growth due to their detrimental pest activities in Africa and Southern Europe. However, S.littoralis showed resistance to many strains of B.thuriginesis and were only effectively controlled by few strains.\n\nWild maize genetic mixing\n\nA study published in Nature in 2001 reported Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, Oaxaca, Mexico.  In 2002, paper concluded, \"the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.\" A significant controversy happened over the paper and Natures unprecedented notice.[https://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html]\n\nA subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca.  A 2007 study found the \"transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities.\" Mexico imports a substantial amount of maize from the US, and due to formal and informal seed networks among rural farmers, many potential routes are available for transgenic maize to enter into food and feed webs.  One study found small-scale (about 1%) introduction of transgenic sequences in sampled fields in Mexico; it did not find evidence for or against this introduced genetic material being inherited by the next generation of plants.  That study was immediately criticized, with the reviewer writing, \"Genetically, any given plant should be either nontransgenic or transgenic, therefore for leaf tissue of a single transgenic plant, a GMO level close to 100% is expected. In their study, the authors chose to classify leaf samples as transgenic despite GMO levels of about 0.1%. We contend that results such as these are incorrectly interpreted as positive and are more likely to be indicative of contamination in the laboratory.\"\n\nColony collapse disorder\n\nAs of 2007, a new phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD) began affecting bee hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes included new parasites, pesticide use, and the use of Bt transgenic crops. The Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees.  According to the USDA, \"Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to Nosema.\"USDA.

July 2012   The actual cause of CCD was unknown in 2007, and scientists believe it may have multiple exacerbating causes.\n\nBeta-exotoxins\n\nSome isolates of B. thuringiensis produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-exotoxin, the common name for which is thuringiensin. A consensus document produced by the OECD says: \"Beta-exotoxin and the other Bacillus toxins may contribute to the insecticidal toxicity of the bacterium to lepidopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran insects. Beta-exotoxin is known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in B. thuringiensis microbial products. Engineering of plants to contain and express only the genes for δ-endotoxins avoids the problem of assessing the risks posed by these other toxins that may be produced in microbial preparations.\"Staff Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

While the target pests are exposed to the toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, Cry proteins are also expressed in other parts of the plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.Fearing, P.L., Brown, D., Vlachos, D., Meghji, M., L. Privalle. 1997. Quantitative analysis of Cry1A(b) expression in Bt maize plants, tissues, and silage and stability of expression over generations. Mol. Breed. 3:169-176.\n\nToxicology studies\n\nAnimal models have been used to assess human health risk from consumption of products containing Cry proteins. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes mouse acute oral feeding studies where doses as high as 5,000 mg/kg body weight resulted in no observed adverse effects.US EPA. 2001. [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/bt_brad2/2-id_health.pdf Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants October 15, 2001 Biopesticides Registration Action Document] Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that toxicity occurs at much lower doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals. The results of toxicology studies are further strengthened by the lack of observed toxicity from decades of use of B. thuringiensis and its crystalline proteins as an insecticidal spray.\n\nAllergenicity studies\n\nIntroduction of a new protein raised concerns regarding the potential for allergic responses in sensitive individuals. Bioinformatic analysis of known allergens has indicated there is no concern of allergic reactions as a result of consumption of Bt toxins. Additionally, skin prick testing using purified Bt protein resulted in no detectable production of toxin-specific IgE antibodies, even in atopic patients.\n\nDigestibility studies\n\nStudies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods. Bt toxin proteins have been shown to digest within minutes of exposure to simulated gastric fluids. The instability of the proteins in digestive fluids is an additional indication that Cry proteins are unlikely to be allergenic, since most known food allergens resist degradation and are ultimately absorbed in the small intestine.\n\nEcological risk assessment\n\nEcological risk assessment aims to ensure there is no unintended impact on non-target organisms and no contamination of natural resources as a result of the use of a new substance, such as the use of Bt in genetically-modified crops. The impact of Bt toxins on the environments where transgenic plants are grown has been evaluated to ensure no adverse effects outside of targeted crop pests.US EPA. 2001. Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants Biopesticides Registration Action Document [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/1-overview.pdf]\n\nPersistence in environment\n\nConcerns over possible environmental impact from accumulation of Bt toxins from plant tissues, pollen dispersal, and direct secretion from roots have been investigated. Bt toxins may persist in soil for over 200 days, with half-lives between 1.6 and 22 days. Much of the toxin is initially degraded rapidly by microorganisms in the environment, while some is adsorbed by organic matter and persists longer. Some studies, in contrast, claim that the toxins do not persist in the soil. Bt toxins are less likely to accumulate in bodies of water, but pollen shed or soil runoff may deposit them in an aquatic ecosystem. Fish species are not susceptible to Bt toxins if exposed.\n\nImpact on non-target organisms\n\nThe toxic nature of Bt proteins has an adverse impact on many major crop pests, but ecological risk assessments have been conducted to ensure safety of beneficial non-target organisms that may come into contact with the toxins. Widespread concerns over toxicity in non-target lepidopterans, such as the monarch butterfly, have been disproved through proper exposure characterization, where it was determined that non-target organisms are not exposed to high enough amounts of the Bt toxins to have an adverse effect on the population. Soil-dwelling organisms, potentially exposed to Bt toxins through root exudates, are not impacted by the growth of Bt crops.\n\nInsect resistance\n\nMultiple insects have developed a resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis. In November 2009, Monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to the first-generation Bt cotton in parts of Gujarat, India - that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Monsanto responded by introducing a second-generation cotton with multiple Bt proteins, which was rapidly adopted. Bollworm resistance to first-generation Bt cotton was also identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States.\nAdditionally, the Indian mealmoth, a common grain pest, is also developing a resistance since Bacillus thuringiensis has been extensively used as a biological control agent against the moth. Studies in the cabbage looper have suggested that a mutation in the membrane transporter ABCC2 can confer resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis.\n\nSecondary pests\n\nSeveral studies have documented surges in \"sucking pests\" (which are not affected by Bt toxins) within a few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with mirids, which have in some cases \"completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation\". The increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.  Another study in five provinces in China found the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars is significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by recent studies that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging secondary pests, such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.; Erratum published 2012 Aug 5: \n\nSimilar problems have been reported in India, with both mealy bugsBhaskar Goswami, InfoChange\n[http://infochangeindia.org/200709026463/Other/Features/Making-a-meal-of-Bt-cotton.html \"Making a meal of Bt cotton\"] Retrieved on 2009-4-6India Times\n[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/Economy/Agriculture/Bug_makes_meal_of_Punjab_cotton_whither_Bt_magic/articleshow/msid-2330585,curpg-1.cms \"Bug makes meal of Punjab cotton, whither Bt magic?\"] Retrieved on 2009-4-6 and aphids although a survey of small Indian farms between 2002 and 2008 concluded Bt cotton adoption has led to higher yields and lower pesticide use, decreasing over time.\n\nControversies\n\nThere are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.Staff, Frontline. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/viewpoints/ Harvest of Fear: Viewpoints] There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.\n\nLepidopteran toxicity\n\nThe most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the monarch butterfly. The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had asserted that \"the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields.\"Emily Waltz for Nature News. September 2, 2009 [http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html GM crops: Battlefield] Nature 461, 27-32 (2009) Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis has been widely used for controlling Spodoptera littoralis larvae growth due to their detrimental pest activities in Africa and Southern Europe. However, S.littoralis showed resistance to many strains of B.thuriginesis and were only effectively controlled by few strains.\n\nWild maize genetic mixing\n\nA study published in Nature in 2001 reported Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, Oaxaca, Mexico.  In 2002, paper concluded, \"the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.\" A significant controversy happened over the paper and Natures unprecedented notice.[https://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html]\n\nA subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca.  A 2007 study found the \"transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities.\" Mexico imports a substantial amount of maize from the US, and due to formal and informal seed networks among rural farmers, many potential routes are available for transgenic maize to enter into food and feed webs.  One study found small-scale (about 1%) introduction of transgenic sequences in sampled fields in Mexico; it did not find evidence for or against this introduced genetic material being inherited by the next generation of plants.  That study was immediately criticized, with the reviewer writing, \"Genetically, any given plant should be either nontransgenic or transgenic, therefore for leaf tissue of a single transgenic plant, a GMO level close to 100% is expected. In their study, the authors chose to classify leaf samples as transgenic despite GMO levels of about 0.1%. We contend that results such as these are incorrectly interpreted as positive and are more likely to be indicative of contamination in the laboratory.\"\n\nColony collapse disorder\n\nAs of 2007, a new phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD) began affecting bee hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes included new parasites, pesticide use, and the use of Bt transgenic crops. The Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees.  According to the USDA, \"Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to Nosema.\"USDA. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul12/colony0712.htm Colony Collapse Disorder: An Incomplete Puzzle]  Agricultural Research Magazine. July 2012   The actual cause of CCD was unknown in 2007, and scientists believe it may have multiple exacerbating causes.\n\nBeta-exotoxins\n\nSome isolates of B. thuringiensis produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-exotoxin, the common name for which is thuringiensin. A consensus document produced by the OECD says: \"Beta-exotoxin and the other Bacillus toxins may contribute to the insecticidal toxicity of the bacterium to lepidopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran insects. Beta-exotoxin is known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in B. thuringiensis microbial products. Engineering of plants to contain and express only the genes for δ-endotoxins avoids the problem of assessing the risks posed by these other toxins that may be produced in microbial preparations.\"Staff Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
