  "textBody" : "Harold and Maude is a 1971 American romantic black comedy drama directed by Hal Ashby and released by Paramount Pictures. It incorporates elements of dark humor and existentialist drama. The plot revolves around the exploits of a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) who is intrigued with death. Harold drifts away from the life that his detached mother (Vivian Pickles) prescribes for him, and slowly develops a strong friendship, and eventually a romantic relationship, with a 79-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon) who teaches Harold about living life to its fullest and that life is the most precious gift of all.\n\nThe film was based on a screenplay written by Colin Higgins and published as a novel in 1971. Filming locations in the San Francisco Bay Area included both Holy Cross Cemetery and Golden Gate National Cemetery, and the ruins of the Sutro Baths.\n\nCritically and commercially unsuccessful when originally released, the film developed a cult following and in 1983 began making a profit. The film is ranked number 45 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies of all Time and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1997, for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".[https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html National Film Registry list of films 1989-2006]. Library of Congress. Retrieved 2011-09-08.  The Criterion Collection special-edition Blu-ray and DVD were released June 12, 2012.\n\nPlot\n\nHarold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a young man obsessed with death. He stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals, and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his socialite mother (Vivian Pickles). She sets him up appointments with a psychoanalyst, but the analyst is befuddled by the case and fails to get Harold to talk about his real emotions.\n\nAt another stranger's funeral service, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who shares Harold's hobby of attending funerals. He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his morbidity. The pair form a bond and Maude shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play banjo), and teaches him how to \"[make] the most of his time on earth\". Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as self-immolation, self-mutilation and seppuku. She tries enlisting him in the military instead, but he deters his recruiting officer uncle by staging a scene in which Maude poses as a pacifist protester and Harold seemingly murders her out of militaristic fanaticism.\n\nWhen Harold and Maude are talking at her home he tells her, without prompting, the motive for his fake suicides: When he was at boarding school, he accidentally caused an explosion in his chemistry lab, leading police to assume his death. Harold returned home just in time to witness his mother react to the news of his death with a ludicrously dramatized faint. As he reaches this part of the story, Harold bursts into tears and says, \"I decided then I enjoyed being dead.\"\n\nAs they become closer, their friendship soon blossoms into a romance and Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest. Maude's 80th birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her. As the couple dance, Maude tells Harold that she \"couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.\" Confused, he questions Maude as to her meaning and she reveals that she has taken an overdose of sleeping pills and will be dead by morning. She restates her firm belief that eighty is the proper age to die.\n\nHarold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies. In the final sequence, Harold's car is seen going off a seaside cliff but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo. After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away, picking out on his banjo Cat Stevens' \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\".\n\nCast\n\n*Ruth Gordon as Dame Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin, a 79-year-old free spirit who wears her hair in braids. Maude believes in living each day to its fullest, and \"trying something new every day\". Her view of life is so joyful that, true to the film's motif, it crosses a blurred, shifting line into a carefree attitude toward death as well. We know little of her past, but learn that as a young woman she lived in pre-war Vienna, was once married and has a Nazi concentration camp tattoo on one arm.\n*Bud Cort as Harold Parker Chasen, an 18-year-old man who is obsessed with death. He drives a hearse, attends funerals of strangers and stages elaborate fake suicides. Through meeting and falling in love with Maude, he discovers joy in living for the first time.\n*Vivian Pickles as Mrs. Chasen, Harold's opulently wealthy mother, is controlling, snooty and seemingly incapable of affection. Hoping to force him into respectability, Mrs. Chasen replaces Harold's beloved hearse with a Jaguar (which he then converts to a miniature hearse) and sets up several blind dates, or more accurately, \"bride interviews\" with young women.\n*Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, the sculptor who makes an ice statue of Maude and lends them his tools to transport a tree.\n*Charles Tyner as General Victor Ball, Harold's uncle who lost an arm in the war and now pulls a hidden cord to make his wire prosthetic \"salute\". At Mrs. Chasen's request, he attempts to prepare Harold to join the armed forces. The effort is thwarted by a planned stunt in which Harold appears to kill Maude.\n*Eric Christmas as the Priest\n*George Wood as Harold's Psychiatrist\n*Ellen Geer as Sunshine Doré, an actress, Harold’s third blind date. She mimics his suicide, giving a histrionic rendition of Juliet's death scene.\n*Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Harold's first blind date, whom he scares off by apparently setting himself on fire.\n*Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Harold's second blind date, whom he dissuades by pretending to cut off his hand.\n*Tom Skerritt (credited as \"M. Borman\") as the Motorcycle Officer who stops Maude and Harold.\n\nDirector Hal Ashby appears in an uncredited cameo, watching a model train at an amusement park. The amusement park is Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk (California USA) / Penny Arcade.\n\nProduction\n\nUCLA student Colin Higgins wrote Harold and Maude as his master's thesis. While working as producer Edward Lewis's pool boy, Higgins showed the script to Lewis's wife, Mildred. Mildred was so impressed that she got Edward to give it to Stanley Jaffe at Paramount. Higgins sold the script with the understanding that he would direct the film but he was told he wasn't ready, after tests he shot proved unsatisfactory to the studio heads. Ashby would only commit to directing the film after getting Higgins' blessing and then, so Higgins could watch and learn from him on the set, Ashby made Higgins a co-producer. Higgins says he originally thought of the story as a play. It then became a 20-minute thesis while at film school. After the film came out, the script was turned into a novel then a play, which ran for several years in Paris.Up From the Underground Harold; Maude; Wilson, John M.

Also on his list were John Rubinstein, for whom Higgins had written the part, and then-up-and-coming British pop star Elton John, whom Ashby had seen live and hoped would also do the music.Dawson, p. 122\n\nAnne Brebner, the casting director, was almost cast as Harold's mother, when Vivian Pickles was briefly unable to do the role.Brebner, Anne (guest); Morrison, John (Host) (May 6, 2011).

Roger Ebert, in a review dated January 1, 1972, gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars. He wrote, \"And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that life's hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell.

He had been suggested by Elton John to do the music after John had dropped out of the project.Dawson, p. 124 Stevens composed two original songs for the film, \"Don't Be Shy\" and \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and performed instrumental and alternate versions of the songs \"On the Road to Find Out\", \"I Wish, I Wish\", \"Miles from Nowhere\", \"Tea for the Tillerman\", \"I Think I See the Light\", \"Where Do the Children Play?\" and \"Trouble\" which were either on the album Mona Bone Jakon or Tea for the Tillerman. Those albums had been released before the film. \"Don't Be Shy\" and \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" were not released on an album, until his 1984 compilation Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2.\n\nThere is some additional non-Cat Stevens music in the film.  \"Greensleeves\" is played on the harp during dinner. During the scene where Harold is floating face-down in the swimming pool, the opening bars of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 are heard. A marching band is also heard playing a march titled \"The Klaxon\" by Henry Fillmore outside the church following a funeral.\n\n1972 soundtrack\n\nThe first soundtrack was released in Japan in 1972 on vinyl and cassette (A&M Records GP-216). It omitted the two original songs and all instrumental and alternate versions of songs and was generally composed of re-released material that was in the film, along with five songs that were not in the film.From the FAQ section of \n\n;Track listing\n*Side one\n*# \"Morning Has Broken\" (not in the film)\n*# \"Wild World\" (not in the film)\n*# \"I Think I See the Light\"\n*# \"I Wish, I Wish\"\n*# \"Trouble\"\n*# \"Father and Son\" (not in the film)\n*Side two\n*# \"Miles from Nowhere\"\n*# \"Lilywhite\" (not in the film)\n*# \"Where Do the Children Play?\"\n*# \"On the Road to Find Out\"\n*# \"Lady D'Arbanville\" (not in the film)\n*# \"Tea for the Tillerman\"\n\n2007 soundtrack\n\nThe second soundtrack was released in December 2007, by Vinyl Films Records, as a vinyl-only limited-edition release of 2,500 copies.

The original Broadway production, starring Janet Gaynor as Maude and Keith McDermott as Harold, closed after four performances in February 1980.[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/8231/Harold-and-Maude Harold and Maude (1980) Playbill Vault]\n\nA French adaptation for television, translated and written by Jean-Claude Carrière, appeared in 1978. It was also adapted for the stage by the Compagnie Viola Léger in Moncton, New Brunswick, starring Roy Dupuis.\n\nUnproduced sequel and prequel\n\nHiggins expressed interest in 1978 about both a sequel and prequel to Harold and Maude. The sequel, Harold's Story, would have Cort portray Harold's life after Maude. Higgins also imagined a prequel showing Maude's life before Harold, Grover and Maude had Maude learning how to steal cars from Grover Muldoon, the character portrayed by Richard Pryor in Higgins' 1976 film Silver Streak.  Higgins wanted Gordon and Pryor to reprise their roles.",

He had been suggested by Elton John to do the music after John had dropped out of the project.Dawson, p. 124 Stevens composed two original songs for the film, \"Don't Be Shy\" and \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and performed instrumental and alternate versions of the songs \"On the Road to Find Out\", \"I Wish, I Wish\", \"Miles from Nowhere\", \"Tea for the Tillerman\", \"I Think I See the Light\", \"Where Do the Children Play?\" and \"Trouble\" which were either on the album Mona Bone Jakon or Tea for the Tillerman. Those albums had been released before the film. \"Don't Be Shy\" and \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" were not released on an album, until his 1984 compilation Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2.\n\nThere is some additional non-Cat Stevens music in the film.  \"Greensleeves\" is played on the harp during dinner. During the scene where Harold is floating face-down in the swimming pool, the opening bars of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 are heard.

It was also adapted for the stage by the Compagnie Viola Léger in Moncton, New Brunswick, starring Roy Dupuis.\n\nUnproduced sequel and prequel\n\nHiggins expressed interest in 1978 about both a sequel and prequel to Harold and Maude. The sequel, Harold's Story, would have Cort portray Harold's life after Maude. Higgins also imagined a prequel showing Maude's life before Harold, Grover and Maude had Maude learning how to steal cars from Grover Muldoon, the character portrayed by Richard Pryor in Higgins' 1976 film Silver Streak.  Higgins wanted Gordon and Pryor to reprise their roles. Harold and Maude. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=13290."
