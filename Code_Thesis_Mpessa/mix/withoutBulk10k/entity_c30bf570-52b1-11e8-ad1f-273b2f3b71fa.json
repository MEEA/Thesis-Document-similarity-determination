He was born in Port Said, Egypt.\nAccording to a research by Michael Frishkopf, he has created his style termed as \"Mediterranean Music\", a blend of Western and Egyptian rhythms. By 1992, he became the first Arabic-speaking artist to start making high-tech music videos.\n\nEarly life\n\nAmr Diab was born on 11 October 1961 in Port Said, Egypt into an artistic family. His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation and was the chairman of Marine Construction & Shipbuilding in Suez Canal. Diab's father played a huge role in igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab's early stages in his professional music career. Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the Egyptian National Anthem \"Bilady, Bilady, Bilady\" at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said in the presence of the late Gamal Abdel Nasser. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally. Diab graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.\n\nCareer\n\nDiab released his first album entitled Ya Tareeq in 1983. Diab's second album, Ghanny Men Albak (1985), was the first of a series of records he released with Delta Sound, including Hala Hala (1986), Khalseen (1987), Mayyal (1988), Shawa'na (1989), Matkhafesh (1990), Habibi (1991), Ayyamna (1992), Ya Omrena (1993), Weylomony (1994), and Rag'een (1995). In 1996 Diab released his first album with Alam El Phan entitled Nour El Ain, which proved an international success and gained Diab recognition beyond the Arabic speaking world. Diab recorded four more albums on the Alam El Phan label including Amarain (1999) on which he collaborated with Khaled (on the song \"Alby\") and with Angela Dimitriou (on the song \"Bahebak Aktar\").\n\nIn the summer of 2004 Diab, having left Alam El Phan, released his first album with Rotana Records, Leily Nehary, which he followed up with the hugely successful Kammel Kalamak (2005), and El Lilady (2007).

David Cooper and Kevin Dawe refer to his music as \"the new breed of Mediterranean music\".
