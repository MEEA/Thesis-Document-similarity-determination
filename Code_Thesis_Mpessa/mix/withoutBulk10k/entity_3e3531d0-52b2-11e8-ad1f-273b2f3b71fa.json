Many of these chapters undertake scientific, engineering and political initiatives to further the Mars Society's goals. Some accomplishments of Mars Society chapters are listed below:\n\nCanada\n\nMars Society of Canada:\n* hosted the Third International Mars Society Convention in 2000 (Toronto)\n* organized a month-long multi-national research expedition (known as Expedition One) to the Mars Desert Research Station in the Utah desert in 2003\n* organized a second multi-national research expedition (known as Expedition Two) in the Australian outback in 2004\n* organized a series of training expeditions (beginning with Expedition Alpha, Beta etc.)\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia\n\nNorthern California Chapter of the Mars Society:\n* hosted the Fourth International Mars Society Convention in 2001 (Stanford University)\n* raised over $100,000 for the Mars Society hosting a fundraiser banquet with James Cameron, May 5, 2001\n* provided Mission Support services for crews at the Mars Desert Research Station starting in 2002\n\nSan Diego\n\nThe Mars Society - San Diego:\n* provides Crewmembers and Mission Support services for the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) and the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) since 2002\n* TMS-SD provides public outreach events to classrooms, libraries, museums and other organizations throughout the Southern California region with seven different multimedia programs:  \"Invasion from Earth - The Robotic Exploration of Mars\"; \"Mars Exploration Rovers - Year 4\"; \"Mars on Earth - The Adventures of Space Pioneers in the Utah Desert\"; \"Mars on Earth - The Adventures of Space Pioneers in the Canadian Arctic: \"Humans to Mars - How We'll Get There\"; \"A Close Look at Mars\"; and \"Mars in the Movies\"\n* TMS-SD offers a 1/4-scale radio controlled Mars Exploration Rover with wireless video that children (of all ages) can operate\n* holds monthly chapter meetings, as well as special program events throughout the year\n* hosts a monthly Mars Movie Night in conjunction with The Mars Movie Guide\n\nTexas\n\nDallas Chapter of the Mars Society:\n* hosted the Mars Track of the National Space Society's International Space Development Conference in 2007\n* Planning Publicizing, and Politicking a vision of Mars colonization in the Dallas area and beyond.\n\nWashington\n\nMars Society Seattle (formerly known as Mars Society Puget Sound):\n* Hosted MarsFest with Seattle's Museum of Flight in 1999 (Polar Lander), 2007 (Phoenix), and 2012 (Curiosity).\n* Staffed outreach table at local events: NSTA conference, Yuri's Night, Norwescon, Rustycon, AIAA, and others.\n* Speaker series (co-sponsored with NSS Seattle) every first Sunday of the month at 7pm in the Red Barn classroom at the Museum of Flight.\n* Website development for the Mars Society in the early days, helped set up chapters.marssociety.org and initial task force websites.http://chapters.marssociety.org/\n\nEuropean Chapters of the Mars Society\n\nAustria\n\nÖsterreichisches Weltraum Forum (OeWF)\nThe ASF (Österreichisches Weltraum Forum, OeWF) is a national network for aerospace and space enthusiasts, being the Austrian chapter of the Mars Society. The Forum serves as a communication platform between the space sector and the public; it is embedded in a global network of specialists from the space industry, research and policy. Hence, the OeWF facilitates a strengthening of the national space sector through enhancing the public visibility of space activities, technical workshops, and conferences as well as Forum-related projects.\n\nTheir research focus is Mars Analogue Research, e.g. the AustroMars mission with roughly 130 volunteers supporting a mission simulation at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) and the ongoing PolAres, a multi-year research program which encompass the development of a Mars analogue rover system and a novel spacesuit prototype dubbed \"Aouda.X\", culminating in an arctic expedition in 2011.\n\nThe Forum has a small, but a highly active pool of professional members contributing to space endeavors, mostly in cooperation with other nations as well as international space organizations. The spectrum of their activities ranges from simple classroom presentation to 15.000-visitors space exhibitions, from expert reports for the Austrian Federal Ministry for Technology to space technology transfer activities for terrestrial applications.\n\nBelgium\n\nMars Society Belgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nMars Society Bulgaria\n\nMars Society Bulgaria was created in 2012.\n\nFrance\n\nAssociation Planète Mars\n\nThe Mars Society French chapter was established in 1999 as \"Association Planète Mars\", a non-profit organization with its headquarters in Paris. Its founder and president is Richard Heidmann, a space propulsion engineer, who participated in the founding convention of the Mars Society in August 1998 and is a member of the Mars Society Steering Committee.\n\nWhile fully supporting the ideas and actions of the Mars Society, it considers that those must be adapted to the specific cultural and political context of France and Europe.\nThe main activities of Association Planète Mars are devoted to public communication, through conferences, exhibits, events, media appearances (TV, radio, magazines...). It also acts occasionally as an adviser for journalists or film makers.\n\nWhenever possible, it cooperates with other associations or science outreach organisms, which permits to reinforce its action and reach a wider public.\n\nAssociation Planète Mars seeks to interest younger people: 25% of its paid members are under the age of 25. It aims to encourage Mars-related projects to be undertaken by engineering students. The association also encourages the formation of working groups on miscellaneous topics. Today, three groups are active, respectively on mission safety, Martian architecture and medical aspects. It has participated in several MDRS and FMARS missions, including a prototype of a \"Cliff Exploration Vehicle\".\n\nAnother major field of action is lobbying, aiming at both political and institutional groups, in France and at the European level (European Council, ESA). In doing so, it relies on the networks established by some of its managers. On the occasion of most critical events, the association publishes political documents to support its views, which are distributed both to opinion formers and to the press. This has been the case in June 2004, in the wake of the US Space Exploration Initiative, and in September 2008 in preparation of the ESA ministerial council.\n\nGermany\n\nMars Society Deutschland\n\nThe German Chapter of the Mars Society (Mars Society Deutschland e.V. | eingetragener Verein | - MSD) was founded in 2001 based on the Founding Declaration of the Mars Society of the USA from 1998 and has about 230 members. The MSD is registered in Germany as a non-profit association (gemeinnütziger Verein). Registered members pay a yearly membership fee of 60 Euro. However, students and firms pay a different fee. The activities of the MSD are focused on technical-scientific projects such as the Mars Balloon Probe ARCHIMEDES as well as on all Mars exploration and general manned space matters. The main means of communication with members and the general public is the MSD Website with information on the ARCHIMEDES project, publications on Mars and other space subjects, the regular news, which can be commented by visitors of the website, the Space Forum and informative meetings.\n\nThe MSD Board comprises five members. Since June 2009 its president is the Space Physicist Dr. Michael Danielides.\nThe development of ARCHIMEDES is led by Dipl.Ing. Hannes Griebel, who is also a member of the MSD Board and prepares his doctorate thesis on ARCHIMEDES.\n\nARCHIMEDES is presently under development and the major project of the MSD since 2001. Starting in 2006, flight tests have been undertaken for testing the innovative balloon system in the low-gravity environment. Test carriers were so far the Airbus A300 for short duration parabolic flights and the sounding rocket test campaigns REXUS3-REGINA and REXUS4-MIRIAM for longer duration flight tests under free space conditions. Further flights tests are planned for the coming years (e.g. MIRIAM II) with the objective of qualifying ARCHIMEDES for its Mars mission by 2018. ARCHIMEDES will be carried to Mars on board an AMSAT Mars Probe or a similar satellite. ARCHIMEDES is developed by the MSD with the support of the Bundeswehr University Munich, of the IABG in Ottobrunn, the DLR-MORABA for rocket flight opportunities, other universities, and several industrial companies supporting specific technical areas.\n\nHellas (Greece)\n\nMars Society Hellas\n\nThe Mars Society Hellas was founded in 2016. Its headquarters are in Athens and its president is Alexandros Krassakis.\nIt is the Official Hellenic Chapter of The Mars Society and its Aims/Constitution Pillars are aligned with The Mars Society’s Founding Declaration. The focus is given in: (i). Bring together people with an interest in the planet Mars; (ii). Establish and co-operate in projects relating to Mars exploration; (iii). Promote awareness of The Mars Society principles; (iv). Engagement of academic institutions with The Mars Society Hellas.\n\nItaly\n\nItalian Mars Society\n\nThe Mars Society Italian chapter (Italian Mars Society) was founded in 2005. Its headquarters are in Curno (Bergamo), near Milan, and its president is Antonio Del Mastro, an entrepreneur and owner of an engineering consulting company.\nThe Italian Mars Society carries out scientific divulgation activities related to the Red Planet. It cooperates with the other European Mars Society chapters to build a knowledge network whose aim is to develop the interest of European people towards Mars exploration.\n\nLuxembourg\n\nAnother Mars Society Chapter is also in creation in Luxembourg.\n\nNetherlands\n\nStichting Mars Society Nederland\n\nThe Dutch Chapter of the Mars Society (Mars Society Netherlands) started with its successful website in 1999. The MS NL is registered in the Netherlands as a non-profit organization (\"stichting\"). Registered members pay a yearly membership fee. The activities of the MS NL are focused on outreach through conferences (national and European), exhibits, events, and media campaigns.\n\nThe main means of communication with members and the general public is still the MS NL Website with information on Mars and related space subjects. In cooperation with the Netherlands Society for Aerospace (NVR), MS NL strives to educate youth in 'kids for space', and the 'RuimteWijs' program, giving lectures about Mars all over Netherlands. Lectures on Mars are also given under auspices of the Dutch Astronomical Society. MS NL cooperates with The Planetary Society in mars events.\n\nThe MS NL has been involved with international projects of The Mars Society from the starts, it is a strong proponent of European cooperation in space endeavours.\n\nThe Mars Society Netherlands chapter ceased to exist since 2011; as its board and members moved over to a new Mars-oriented organisation.\n\nPoland\n\nMars Society Polska (MSP)\n\nMars Society Polska (MSP) is actively participating in the creation of the Polish space industry. Since this sector is still developing, the organization is taking the opportunity to provide a strong Mars-related element for the years to come. Poland was the last member state of the EU to sign the cooperation agreement with ESA. Most projects in Poland currently focus on satellite technology, so MSP is the only leading organization promoting exploration and manned spaceflight. Besides private sponsors, it relies on resources obtained from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and local authorities, proposing projects to be undertaken with local communities and thus engaging with the general public.\n\nMSP's first project was the Polish MPV (pressurized rover) design, for which some hardware was produced. This enabled development of the Polish Mars Society itself, together with a number of educational activities for Polish schools. This was followed by the joint organization of the Polish edition of the Red Rover Goes to Mars contest and organization of a Mars colonization negotiation game (Columbia Memorial Negotiations). In 2007 MSP organized the first Mars Festival, a two-day event which drew 600 visitors, with Discovery Channel as the main sponsor. Mars Festival 2008 was smaller due to the efforts being made in other projects, particularly the Polish URC rover, named Skarabeusz.\n\nThe flagship MSP project is the Polish Martian habitat, based on a design by Janek Kozicki. It has three inflatable modules attached and a usable surface of 900 m². The habitat is to be located close to a large town, meaning that beyond its role as a test site, largely for materials and design, it will be accessible to the wider public and media.\n\nMSP has established a constant presence in the mainstream Polish media and is working on a documentary about itself. It is also developing software projects, IT systems for the future martian habitat, with a Virtual Mars Base and remote access. Jan Kotlarz of MSP has created RODM software for the modeling of the Martian surface based on high-resolution photographs from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. RODM is currently being tested by NASA and ESA.\n\nSpain\n\nMars Society España\n\nThe Spanish Mars society acts as a meeting, news, and conference organizer.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nMars Society Switzerland\n\nThe Mars Society Switzerland (\"MSS\") was founded in February 2010. It covers the French and German speaking parts of Switzerland. It keeps close links with the French branch (\"association planète Mars\", see above).\nIts aim is to convince the Swiss public of the interest and feasibility of the Martian exploration with inhabited flights through the Mars direct concept such as described by Robert Zubrin. It wants to gather around the scientists working on Mars in Switzerland, all people who share their interest on the matter.\n\nIn November 2010, MSS participated to the 8th Swiss Geoscience Meeting which was the opportunity to discuss the main topics related to Mars geology, the making of the planet, the role of water and the atmosphere.\n\nIn 2011 (September 30 until October 2), MSS held the 11th European Mars Convention (\"EMC11\") in the frame of the University of Neuchâtel. Through 24 presentations and two debates with major Swiss media, this convention covered all subjects related to Mars exploration; from astronautics to architecture, including the study of geology which remains its key objective.\n\nOn September 10, 2012, in the Natural History Museum Bern (\"NHMB\"), it held a conference on the theme \"Searching for Life on Mars\". \nThe conference was centered upon a presentation by Professor André Maeder (a well-known astrophysicist at the University of Geneva) following the publishing of his book \"L'unique Terre habitée?\" (Favre editions). Another presentation was made by Dr. Beda Hofmann, Head of the Earth Science Dept. of the NHMB. He showed and commented photos of primitive forms of life which he gathered to serve as references for the observations to be made by the ESA ExoMars mission (to be launched in 2018).\nPierre Brisson, president of the Mars Society Switzerland introduced the conference, speaking about the instruments aboard Curiosity and the targets of exploration of the rover.\n\nIn October (12th till 14th) The Mars Society Switzerland participated to the 12th EMC (\"EMC12\") in Neubiberg, Germany (University of the German Armed Forces, near Münich). In this frame, Pierre Brisson discussed the past possibility of an Ocean in the Northern Lowlands of the planet.\n\nA key event of the year 2013 (March 26), was a conference organized with \"Club 44\" in La Chaux de Fonds, during which Professor Michel Cabane, LATMOS and co-PI of the SAM Instruments aboard Curiosity, presented the findings of his instruments dedicated to the study of the molecular and atomic compositions of the rocks and atmosphere of the planet Mars.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nMars Society UK\n\nThe Mars Society UK is the oldest Mars Society outside the United States. It held its first public meeting on July 4, 1998, in London. Professor Colin Pillinger, head of the Beagle 2 project, was the Guest Speaker, and the event marked the first time Beagle 2 had been presented to the general public in the UK. From 1998 through to 2003, the Mars society UK (MSUK) continued to support Beagle 2, providing numerous public events at which members of the Beagle 2 project team could speak, and the Beagle 2 model be displayed.\n\nHighlights of the MSUK's history include:\n* It hosted the first Mars Society European Leaders Meeting, with representatives from France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the Netherlands.\n* The first UK Mars Day, attended by some 200 members of the public took place in 2002. It was covered by all the UK's leading television media (BBC, ITN, Sky News).\n* In 2003, it had white papers accepted and published by the UK government as a part of a review of UK Space Policy. It also actively lobbied for UK involvement in human spaceflight endeavours.\n* Since 2006 it helped establish the Sir Arthur Clarke Award, the most prodigious award given in the United Kingdom for contribution in all field of space research and exploration. it also continued to provide consultation and white papers on the UK's changing space policy and helped determine the UK government's decision to actively engage in human spaceflight activities from 2010.\n* It is currently engaged in a further UK space policy review aimed at determining whether the UK requires a dedicated space agency.\n\nMore recently, the MSUK had been allied with attempts to initiate a formally recognized and fully founded UK Space Conference (UKSC) with the first such event being held in April 2009.\n\nMars Society chapters in Asian countries \n\nIndia \n\nThe Mars Society India chapter (MSI) was founded in January 2012 by Dhruv Joshi, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Varun Sudarsanan, The Mars Quarterly, Page 10 Vol 5, Issue 1 Summer 2013 http://members.marssociety.org/TMQ/TMQ-V5-I1.pdf .

It has participated in several MDRS and FMARS missions, including a prototype of a \"Cliff Exploration Vehicle\".\n\nAnother major field of action is lobbying, aiming at both political and institutional groups, in France and at the European level (European Council, ESA). In doing so, it relies on the networks established by some of its managers. On the occasion of most critical events, the association publishes political documents to support its views, which are distributed both to opinion formers and to the press. This has been the case in June 2004, in the wake of the US Space Exploration Initiative, and in September 2008 in preparation of the ESA ministerial council.\n\nGermany\n\nMars Society Deutschland\n\nThe German Chapter of the Mars Society (Mars Society Deutschland e.V. | eingetragener Verein | - MSD) was founded in 2001 based on the Founding Declaration of the Mars Society of the USA from 1998 and has about 230 members. The MSD is registered in Germany as a non-profit association (gemeinnütziger Verein). Registered members pay a yearly membership fee of 60 Euro. However, students and firms pay a different fee. The activities of the MSD are focused on technical-scientific projects such as the Mars Balloon Probe ARCHIMEDES as well as on all Mars exploration and general manned space matters. The main means of communication with members and the general public is the MSD Website with information on the ARCHIMEDES project, publications on Mars and other space subjects, the regular news, which can be commented by visitors of the website, the Space Forum and informative meetings.\n\nThe MSD Board comprises five members. Since June 2009 its president is the Space Physicist Dr. Michael Danielides.\nThe development of ARCHIMEDES is led by Dipl.Ing. Hannes Griebel, who is also a member of the MSD Board and prepares his doctorate thesis on ARCHIMEDES.\n\nARCHIMEDES is presently under development and the major project of the MSD since 2001. Starting in 2006, flight tests have been undertaken for testing the innovative balloon system in the low-gravity environment. Test carriers were so far the Airbus A300 for short duration parabolic flights and the sounding rocket test campaigns REXUS3-REGINA and REXUS4-MIRIAM for longer duration flight tests under free space conditions. Further flights tests are planned for the coming years (e.g. MIRIAM II) with the objective of qualifying ARCHIMEDES for its Mars mission by 2018. ARCHIMEDES will be carried to Mars on board an AMSAT Mars Probe or a similar satellite. ARCHIMEDES is developed by the MSD with the support of the Bundeswehr University Munich, of the IABG in Ottobrunn, the DLR-MORABA for rocket flight opportunities, other universities, and several industrial companies supporting specific technical areas.\n\nHellas (Greece)\n\nMars Society Hellas\n\nThe Mars Society Hellas was founded in 2016. Its headquarters are in Athens and its president is Alexandros Krassakis.\nIt is the Official Hellenic Chapter of The Mars Society and its Aims/Constitution Pillars are aligned with The Mars Society’s Founding Declaration. The focus is given in: (i). Bring together people with an interest in the planet Mars; (ii). Establish and co-operate in projects relating to Mars exploration; (iii). Promote awareness of The Mars Society principles; (iv). Engagement of academic institutions with The Mars Society Hellas.\n\nItaly\n\nItalian Mars Society\n\nThe Mars Society Italian chapter (Italian Mars Society) was founded in 2005. Its headquarters are in Curno (Bergamo), near Milan, and its president is Antonio Del Mastro, an entrepreneur and owner of an engineering consulting company.\nThe Italian Mars Society carries out scientific divulgation activities related to the Red Planet. It cooperates with the other European Mars Society chapters to build a knowledge network whose aim is to develop the interest of European people towards Mars exploration.\n\nLuxembourg\n\nAnother Mars Society Chapter is also in creation in Luxembourg.\n\nNetherlands\n\nStichting Mars Society Nederland\n\nThe Dutch Chapter of the Mars Society (Mars Society Netherlands) started with its successful website in 1999. The MS NL is registered in the Netherlands as a non-profit organization (\"stichting\"). Registered members pay a yearly membership fee. The activities of the MS NL are focused on outreach through conferences (national and European), exhibits, events, and media campaigns.\n\nThe main means of communication with members and the general public is still the MS NL Website with information on Mars and related space subjects. In cooperation with the Netherlands Society for Aerospace (NVR), MS NL strives to educate youth in 'kids for space', and the 'RuimteWijs' program, giving lectures about Mars all over Netherlands. Lectures on Mars are also given under auspices of the Dutch Astronomical Society. MS NL cooperates with The Planetary Society in mars events.\n\nThe MS NL has been involved with international projects of The Mars Society from the starts, it is a strong proponent of European cooperation in space endeavours.\n\nThe Mars Society Netherlands chapter ceased to exist since 2011; as its board and members moved over to a new Mars-oriented organisation.\n\nPoland\n\nMars Society Polska (MSP)\n\nMars Society Polska (MSP) is actively participating in the creation of the Polish space industry. Since this sector is still developing, the organization is taking the opportunity to provide a strong Mars-related element for the years to come. Poland was the last member state of the EU to sign the cooperation agreement with ESA. Most projects in Poland currently focus on satellite technology, so MSP is the only leading organization promoting exploration and manned spaceflight. Besides private sponsors, it relies on resources obtained from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and local authorities, proposing projects to be undertaken with local communities and thus engaging with the general public.\n\nMSP's first project was the Polish MPV (pressurized rover) design, for which some hardware was produced. This enabled development of the Polish Mars Society itself, together with a number of educational activities for Polish schools. This was followed by the joint organization of the Polish edition of the Red Rover Goes to Mars contest and organization of a Mars colonization negotiation game (Columbia Memorial Negotiations). In 2007 MSP organized the first Mars Festival, a two-day event which drew 600 visitors, with Discovery Channel as the main sponsor. Mars Festival 2008 was smaller due to the efforts being made in other projects, particularly the Polish URC rover, named Skarabeusz.\n\nThe flagship MSP project is the Polish Martian habitat, based on a design by Janek Kozicki. It has three inflatable modules attached and a usable surface of 900 m². The habitat is to be located close to a large town, meaning that beyond its role as a test site, largely for materials and design, it will be accessible to the wider public and media.\n\nMSP has established a constant presence in the mainstream Polish media and is working on a documentary about itself. It is also developing software projects, IT systems for the future martian habitat, with a Virtual Mars Base and remote access. Jan Kotlarz of MSP has created RODM software for the modeling of the Martian surface based on high-resolution photographs from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. RODM is currently being tested by NASA and ESA.\n\nSpain\n\nMars Society España\n\nThe Spanish Mars society acts as a meeting, news, and conference organizer.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nMars Society Switzerland\n\nThe Mars Society Switzerland (\"MSS\") was founded in February 2010. It covers the French and German speaking parts of Switzerland. It keeps close links with the French branch (\"association planète Mars\", see above).\nIts aim is to convince the Swiss public of the interest and feasibility of the Martian exploration with inhabited flights through the Mars direct concept such as described by Robert Zubrin. It wants to gather around the scientists working on Mars in Switzerland, all people who share their interest on the matter.\n\nIn November 2010, MSS participated to the 8th Swiss Geoscience Meeting which was the opportunity to discuss the main topics related to Mars geology, the making of the planet, the role of water and the atmosphere.\n\nIn 2011 (September 30 until October 2), MSS held the 11th European Mars Convention (\"EMC11\") in the frame of the University of Neuchâtel. Through 24 presentations and two debates with major Swiss media, this convention covered all subjects related to Mars exploration; from astronautics to architecture, including the study of geology which remains its key objective.\n\nOn September 10, 2012, in the Natural History Museum Bern (\"NHMB\"), it held a conference on the theme \"Searching for Life on Mars\". \nThe conference was centered upon a presentation by Professor André Maeder (a well-known astrophysicist at the University of Geneva) following the publishing of his book \"L'unique Terre habitée?\" (Favre editions). Another presentation was made by Dr. Beda Hofmann, Head of the Earth Science Dept. of the NHMB. He showed and commented photos of primitive forms of life which he gathered to serve as references for the observations to be made by the ESA ExoMars mission (to be launched in 2018).\nPierre Brisson, president of the Mars Society Switzerland introduced the conference, speaking about the instruments aboard Curiosity and the targets of exploration of the rover.\n\nIn October (12th till 14th) The Mars Society Switzerland participated to the 12th EMC (\"EMC12\") in Neubiberg, Germany (University of the German Armed Forces, near Münich). In this frame, Pierre Brisson discussed the past possibility of an Ocean in the Northern Lowlands of the planet.\n\nA key event of the year 2013 (March 26), was a conference organized with \"Club 44\" in La Chaux de Fonds, during which Professor Michel Cabane, LATMOS and co-PI of the SAM Instruments aboard Curiosity, presented the findings of his instruments dedicated to the study of the molecular and atomic compositions of the rocks and atmosphere of the planet Mars.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nMars Society UK\n\nThe Mars Society UK is the oldest Mars Society outside the United States. It held its first public meeting on July 4, 1998, in London. Professor Colin Pillinger, head of the Beagle 2 project, was the Guest Speaker, and the event marked the first time Beagle 2 had been presented to the general public in the UK. From 1998 through to 2003, the Mars society UK (MSUK) continued to support Beagle 2, providing numerous public events at which members of the Beagle 2 project team could speak, and the Beagle 2 model be displayed.\n\nHighlights of the MSUK's history include:\n* It hosted the first Mars Society European Leaders Meeting, with representatives from France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the Netherlands.\n* The first UK Mars Day, attended by some 200 members of the public took place in 2002. It was covered by all the UK's leading television media (BBC, ITN, Sky News).\n* In 2003, it had white papers accepted and published by the UK government as a part of a review of UK Space Policy. It also actively lobbied for UK involvement in human spaceflight endeavours.\n* Since 2006 it helped establish the Sir Arthur Clarke Award, the most prodigious award given in the United Kingdom for contribution in all field of space research and exploration. it also continued to provide consultation and white papers on the UK's changing space policy and helped determine the UK government's decision to actively engage in human spaceflight activities from 2010.\n* It is currently engaged in a further UK space policy review aimed at determining whether the UK requires a dedicated space agency.\n\nMore recently, the MSUK had been allied with attempts to initiate a formally recognized and fully founded UK Space Conference (UKSC) with the first such event being held in April 2009.\n\nMars Society chapters in Asian countries \n\nIndia \n\nThe Mars Society India chapter (MSI) was founded in January 2012 by Dhruv Joshi, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Varun Sudarsanan, The Mars Quarterly, Page 10 Vol 5, Issue 1 Summer 2013 http://members.marssociety.org/TMQ/TMQ-V5-I1.pdf .
