  "textBody" : "The Battle of Adwa (Amharic: አድዋ; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name Adua) was fought on 2 March 1896 between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Adwa, Ethiopia, in Tigray. This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.\n\nAs the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the Berlin Conference. The two independent exceptions were the  Republic of Liberia on the west coast and Ethiopia, or then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. The newly unified Kingdom of Italy was a relative newcomer to the imperialist scramble for Africa. Italy had two recently obtained African territories: Eritrea and Italian Somalia. Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II as the contemporary Ethiopian leader pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians.\n\nBackground \n\nIn 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with then Negus Menelik of Shewa. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, Serae, and parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Amharic version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.\n\nThe Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty.  As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the First Italo-Ethiopian War. In December 1894, Bahta Hagos led a rebellion against the Italians in Akkele Guzay, in what was then Italian controlled Eritrea. Units of General Oreste Baratieri's army under Major  crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the Tigrayan capital, Adwa. In January 1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat Ras Mengesha Yohannes in the Battle of Coatit, forcing Mengesha to retreat further south.\n\nBy late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, Ras Makonnen, Ras Welle Betul and Ras Mengesha Yohannes commanding a larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the Battle of Amba Alagi. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in Tigray, where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General Oreste Baratieri, commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor Menelik the second's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.\n\nOn the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera,  met with his brigadiers Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note,  revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as Asmara. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.Harold G. Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844–1913, 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 170 Dabormida exclaiming, \"Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat.\" Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00.David Levering Lewis, The Race for Fashoda (New York: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), p. 116.  His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.\n\nForces assembled\n\nThe Italian army comprised four brigades totaling 17,978 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces.Lewis, Fashoda, pp. 116f. He breaks down their numbers into 10,596 Italian officers and soldiers and 7,104 Eritrean askaris.  However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that \"several thousand\" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effectives.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 173 One brigade under General Albertone was made up of Eritrean askari led by Italian officers.Thomas Pakenham, p. 481 The Scramble for Africa,  The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite Bersaglieri and Alpini units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed \"d'Africa\" battalions for service in Africa. Additionally a limited number of troops were drafted from the  Cacciatori d'Africa units of local Italian settlers.George Fitz-Hardinge Berkley The Campaign of Adowa and the rise of Menelik, London: Constable 1901.Raffaele Ruggeri, p. 82 Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900, Editrice Militare Italiana 1988\n\nAs Chris Prouty describes:\n\nOrder of battle\n\nItalian forces\n\n* (Italian operational corps in Eritrea):\n** Commander, general Oreste Baratieri\n** Chief of Staff, lieutenant colonel Giacchino Valenzano\n* Right Column: (3,800 rifles / 18 cannons) 2nd Infantry Brigade (gen.Vittorio Dabormida);\n** 3rd Africa Infantry Regiment,Italian national units, formed for service in the colonies with personnel drawn from the regular infantry regiments of the Army.

See also Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A–C. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003, p. 108.  The forces were divided among Emperor Menelik, Empress Taytu Betul, Ras Wale Betul, Ras Mengesha Atikem, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, Ras Alula Engida, Ras Mikael of Wollo, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, Fitawrari Gebeyyehu, and Negus Tekle Haymanot Tessemma.Pétridès (as well as Pankhurst, with slight variations) break the troop numbers down (over 100,000 by their estimates) as follows: 35,000 infantry (25,000 riflemen and 10,000 spearmen) and 8,000 cavalry under Emperor Menelik; 5,000 infantry under Empress Taytu; 8,000 infantry (6,000 riflemen and 2,000 spearmen) under Ras Wale; 8,000 infantry (5,000 riflemen and 3,000 spearmen) under Ras Mengesha Atikem, 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under Ras Mengesha Yohannes and Ras Alula Engida; 6,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 5,000 Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael of Wollo; 25,000 riflemen under Ras Makonnen; 8,000 infantry under Fitawrari Gebeyyehu; 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under Negus Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, von Uhlig, Encyclopaedia, p. 109. In addition, the armies were followed by a similar number of camp followers who supplied the army, as had been done for centuries.Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A–C (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p. 108. Most of the army was composed of riflemen, a significant percentage of which were in Menelik's reserve; however, there were also a significant number of cavalry and infantry only armed with lances. The Kuban Cossack army officer N. S. Leontiev who visited Ethiopia in 1895,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1895/feb/28/russian-mission-to-abyssinia Russian Mission to Abyssina].[http://www.300.years.spb.ru/eng/3_spb_3.html?id64 Who Was Count Abai?]. according to some sources, led a small team of Russian advisers and volunteers.[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Aethiopien/Artamonov/framepred.htm Leonid Artamonov, a Russian general, geographer and traveler, military adviser of Menelik II, as one of Russian officers of volunteers attached to the forces of Ras Tessema (wrote: Through Ethiopia to the White Nile).][http://www.sworld.com.ua/index.php/ru/history/world-history-and-the-history-of-ukraine/768-vinogradova-kv The activities of the officer the Kuban Cossack army N.S. Leontjev in the Italian-Ethiopic war in 1895–1896][http://www.samizdat.com/armies.html – With the Armies of Menelik II by Alexander K. Bulatovich] Other sources assert that Leontiev did not in fact participate in the battle, rather he visited Ethiopia first unofficially in January 1895, and then officially as a representative of Russia in August 1895, but then left later that year, only to return after the battle of Adwa.Raymond Jonas, \"The Battle of Adwa\" (Harvard University Press, 2011), pp. 310–14.\n\nBattle \n\nOn the night of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades advanced separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped.Uhlig, Encyclopaedia, p. 109. David Levering Lewis states that the Italian battle plan: However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras Alula's position.\n\nUnbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael at the head of the Oromo cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve.Lewis, Fashoda, p. 117. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.\n\nAlbertone's Askari Brigade was the first to encounter the onrush of Ethiopians at 6:00, near Kidane Meret,In the attached map, this is labelled \"Chidane Meret\", which is immediately above (west) of the hill \"Rajò\". where the Ethiopians had managed to set up their mountain artillery. Accounts of the Ethiopian artillery deployed at Adwa differ; Russian advisor Leonid Artamonov wrote that it comprised forty-two Russian mountain guns supported by a team of fifteen advisers, but British historians suggest that the Ethiopian guns were Hotchkiss and Maxim pieces captured from the Egyptians or purchased from French and other European suppliers.Sean McLachlan, p. 37 \"Armies of the Adowa Campaign 1896\",  Albertone's heavily outnumbered Askaris held their position for two hours until Albertone's capture, and under Ethiopian pressure the survivors sought refuge with Arimondi's brigade. Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 Shewans and swamped the Italian defenders. Two companies of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.\n\nDabormida's Italian Brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian Army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting Ebalgume! Ebalgume! (\"Reap! Reap!\"). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, \"a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars\".George Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley, Campaign of Adowa (1902), quoted in Lewis, Fashoda, p. 118.\n\nThe remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of Mount Belah. Menelik watched as Gojjam forces under the command of Tekle Haymonot made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade. By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.\n\nImmediate aftermath \n\nThe Italians suffered about 7,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner. Brigadiers Dabormida and Arimondi were amongst the dead. Ethiopian losses have been estimated at around 4,000–5,000 killed and 8,000 wounded.Pankhurst. The Ethiopians, pp. 191–92. In their flight to Eritrea, the Italians left behind all of their artillery and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport. As Paul B. Henze notes, \"Baratieri's army had been completely annihilated while Menelik's was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians.\"Henze, Layers of Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 170. The 3,000 Italian prisoners, who included Brigadier Albertone, appear to have been treated as well as could be expected under difficult circumstances, though about 200 died of their wounds in captivity.Chris Prouty notes that Albertone was given into the care of Azaj Zamanel, commander of Empress Taytu's personal army, and \"had a tent to himself, a horse and servants\". Empress Taytu, pp. 169ff. However, 800 captured askaris, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, had their right hands and left feet amputated. Augustus Wylde records when he visited the battlefield months after the battle, the pile of severed hands and feet was still visible, \"a rotting heap of ghastly remnants.\"Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 213 Further, many had not survived their punishment, Wylde writing how the neighborhood of Adwa \"was full of their freshly dead bodies; they had generally crawled to the banks of the streams to quench their thirst, where many of them lingered unattended and exposed to the elements until death put an end to their sufferings.\"Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, p. 214 There does not appear to be any foundation for reports that some Italians were castrated and these may reflect confusion with the atrocious treatment of the askari prisoners.Prouty has collected the few documented experiences of these POWs, none of whom claim to have been treated inhumanely (Empress Taytu, pp. 170–83). She repeats the opinion of the Italian historian Angelo del Boca, that \"the paucity of the record is attributable to the glacial welcome received in Italy by the returning prisoners for having lost a war, and the fact that they were subjected to long interrogations when they debarked, were defrauded of their back pay, had their mementoes confiscated and were ordered not to talk to journalists\" (p. 170).\n\nBaratieri was relieved of his command and later charged with preparing an \"inexcusable\" plan of attack and for abandoning his troops in the field. He was acquitted on these charges but was described by the court martial judges as being \"entirely unfit\" for his command.\n\nPublic opinion in Italy was outraged.Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870–1900 (2010) Chris Prouty offers a panoramic overview of the response in Italy to the news:\n\nThe Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission. The Russian mission was a military mission conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik's Adwa victory.[http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html The Russian Red Cross Mission] \n\nFollow-up to Ethiopian victory \n\nEmperor Menelik decided not to follow up on his victory by attempting to drive the routed Italians out of their colony. The victorious Emperor limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale. In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal famine; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 176. At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that \"a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources.\"Prouty, Empress Taytu, p. 161. Lewis believes that it \"was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade\"Lewis, Fashoda, p. 120. that stayed his hand.\n\nAs a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa, recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the League of Nations's weak response to the Abyssinia Crisis, the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by Benito Mussolini, the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as chemical warfare, and the Ethiopian forces were defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936–41), before eventually being driven out during World War II by British Empire and Ethiopian Arbegnoch (patriot) forces.\n\nSignificance \n\n\"The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history,\" writes Henze.Henze, Layers of Layers of Time, p.180. On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde observed that \"few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa\".Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 81.\n\nThe Russian Empire had sold some artillery pieces to the Ethiopian forces and paid enthusiastic compliments to the Ethiopian success. One of the documents of that time stated \"The Victory immediately gained the general sympathy of Russian society and it continued to grow.\" The unique outlook which polyethnic Russia exhibited to Ethiopia disturbed many supporters of European nationalism during the twentieth century. The Russian Cossack captain Nikolay Leontiev with a small escort was present at the battle as an observer.[http://www.tvoros.ru/proza/kazaki-u-imperatora-menelika-vtorogo.html Cossacks of the emperor Menelik II]\n\nThis defeat of a colonial power and the ensuing recognition of African sovereignty became rallying points for later African nationalists during their struggle for decolonization, as well as activists and leaders of the Pan-African movement.Professor Kinfe Abraham, \"The Impact of the Adowa Victory on The Pan-African and Pan-Black Anti-Colonial Struggle,\" Address delivered to The Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, 8 February 2006 As the Afrocentric scholar Molefe Asante explains,\n\nOn the other hand, many writers have pointed out how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. One student of Ethiopia, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa \"became a national trauma which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935\". Levine also noted that the victory \"gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West – resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/Haile Selassie would have to contend\".[http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2009/03/the-battle-of-adwa-as-a-historic-event/ \"The Battle of Adwa as a 'Historic' Event\"], Ethiopian Review, 3 March 2009 (Retrieved 9 March 2009)\n\nContemporary celebrations of Adwa \n\nPublic holiday\n\nThe victory of Adwa, which is officially celebrated across Ethiopia on the 1st of March every year, marks the momentous victory that Ethiopia achieved against the invading Italian army on March 1, 1896. Most historians agree that the Battle of Adwa is the first inter-state conflict of its kind where an African army has definitively defeated a European army. Ethiopia’s decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa has inspired several African countries in their fight against European colonialism. On the 121st anniversary of Adwa, Ethiopian academic and social media contributor Wondwesen Tafesse posted a message on Facebook that reads, “Most nations have independence day, we [Ethiopians] have victory day. And, we call it…A D W A”.Wondwosen TE – most nations have independence day, we have.. (2017) Available at: https://www.facebook.com/wondwesen/posts/10155081782689324?hc_location=ufi (Accessed: 5 March 2017). This message resonated with the Ethiopian social media community, and has since been shared, retweeted and posted on different social media networking sites thousands of times. The message has inspired Ethiopians, and served as a motto during the 121st celebration of the Victory of Adwa on social media.\n\nThe Victory of Adwa is a public holiday in all regional states and charter cities across Ethiopia. All schools, banks, post offices and government offices are closed, with the exceptions of health facilities. Some taxi services and public transports choose not to operate on this day. Shops are normally open but most close earlier than usual.\n\nPublic celebrations\n\nThe Victory of Adwa, being a public holiday, is commemorated in public spaces. In Addis Ababa, the Victory of Adwa is celebrated at Menelik Square with the presence of government officials, patriots, foreign diplomats and the general public. Ethiopian Police Orchestra play various patriotic songs as they walk around Menelik Square.\n\nThe public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire. Men often wear Jodhpurs pants, various types of vest tops, and carry the Ethiopian flag, various patriotic banners and placards, and traditional Ethiopian shields and swords called Shotel. Women dress up in different patterns of handcrafted traditional Ethiopian clothing, known in Amharic as Habesha kemis. Some wear black gowns on top, while others put royal crowns on their head. Women’s dressing style, like their male counterparts, imitate the traditional style of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular note is the dominant presence of Empress Taytu Betul during these celebrations.\n\nEmpress Taytu Betul is the beloved and influential wife of Emperor Menelik II, who played a significant role during the Battle of Adwa. Although often overlooked, thousands of women fought during the Battle of Adwa alongside men. Some were trained as nurses to attend to the wounded, while others mainly cooked and supplied food and water to the soldiers and comforted the wounded.\n\nIn addition to Addis Ababa, other major cities in Ethiopia, including Bahir Dar, Debre Markos and the town of Adwa itself, where the Battle of Adwa took place, celebrate the Victory of Adwa in public ceremonies.\n\nSymbols\n\nSeveral images and symbols are used during the commemoration of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured Green, Gold and Red Ethiopian flag, images of Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul, as well as other prominent kings and war generals of the time including King Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, King Michael of Wollo, Dejazmach Balcha Safo, Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis Dinagde, and Fitawrari Gebeyehu, among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror Menelik II, Empress Taytu, Emperor Haile Selassie and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and patriotic songs are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are Ejigayehu Shibabaw’s ballad dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and Teddy Afro’s popular song “Tikur Sew”, which literally translates to “black man or black person” – a poetic reference to Emperor Menelik II’s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor’s darker skin complexion.\n\nFilm \n\n* Adwa – 1999 documentary film directed by Haile Gerima.",

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.\n\nAs the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the Berlin Conference. The two independent exceptions were the  Republic of Liberia on the west coast and Ethiopia, or then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. The newly unified Kingdom of Italy was a relative newcomer to the imperialist scramble for Africa. Italy had two recently obtained African territories: Eritrea and Italian Somalia. Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II as the contemporary Ethiopian leader pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians.\n\nBackground \n\nIn 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with then Negus Menelik of Shewa. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, Serae, and parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Amharic version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.\n\nThe Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty.  As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the First Italo-Ethiopian War. In December 1894, Bahta Hagos led a rebellion against the Italians in Akkele Guzay, in what was then Italian controlled Eritrea. Units of General Oreste Baratieri's army under Major  crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the Tigrayan capital, Adwa. In January 1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat Ras Mengesha Yohannes in the Battle of Coatit, forcing Mengesha to retreat further south.\n\nBy late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, Ras Makonnen, Ras Welle Betul and Ras Mengesha Yohannes commanding a larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the Battle of Amba Alagi. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in Tigray, where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General Oreste Baratieri, commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor Menelik the second's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.\n\nOn the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera,  met with his brigadiers Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note,  revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as Asmara. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.Harold G. Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844–1913, 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 170 Dabormida exclaiming, \"Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat.\" Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00.David Levering Lewis, The Race for Fashoda (New York: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), p. 116.  His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.\n\nForces assembled\n\nThe Italian army comprised four brigades totaling 17,978 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces.Lewis, Fashoda, pp. 116f. He breaks down their numbers into 10,596 Italian officers and soldiers and 7,104 Eritrean askaris.  However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that \"several thousand\" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effectives.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 173 One brigade under General Albertone was made up of Eritrean askari led by Italian officers.Thomas Pakenham, p. 481 The Scramble for Africa,  The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite Bersaglieri and Alpini units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed \"d'Africa\" battalions for service in Africa. Additionally a limited number of troops were drafted from the  Cacciatori d'Africa units of local Italian settlers.George Fitz-Hardinge Berkley The Campaign of Adowa and the rise of Menelik, London: Constable 1901.Raffaele Ruggeri, p. 82 Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900, Editrice Militare Italiana 1988\n\nAs Chris Prouty describes:\n\nOrder of battle\n\nItalian forces\n\n* (Italian operational corps in Eritrea):\n** Commander, general Oreste Baratieri\n** Chief of Staff, lieutenant colonel Giacchino Valenzano\n* Right Column: (3,800 rifles / 18 cannons) 2nd Infantry Brigade (gen.Vittorio Dabormida);\n** 3rd Africa Infantry Regiment,Italian national units, formed for service in the colonies with personnel drawn from the regular infantry regiments of the Army.

See also Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A–C. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003, p. 108.  The forces were divided among Emperor Menelik, Empress Taytu Betul, Ras Wale Betul, Ras Mengesha Atikem, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, Ras Alula Engida, Ras Mikael of Wollo, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, Fitawrari Gebeyyehu, and Negus Tekle Haymanot Tessemma.Pétridès (as well as Pankhurst, with slight variations) break the troop numbers down (over 100,000 by their estimates) as follows: 35,000 infantry (25,000 riflemen and 10,000 spearmen) and 8,000 cavalry under Emperor Menelik; 5,000 infantry under Empress Taytu; 8,000 infantry (6,000 riflemen and 2,000 spearmen) under Ras Wale; 8,000 infantry (5,000 riflemen and 3,000 spearmen) under Ras Mengesha Atikem, 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under Ras Mengesha Yohannes and Ras Alula Engida; 6,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 5,000 Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael of Wollo; 25,000 riflemen under Ras Makonnen; 8,000 infantry under Fitawrari Gebeyyehu; 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under Negus Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, von Uhlig, Encyclopaedia, p. 109. In addition, the armies were followed by a similar number of camp followers who supplied the army, as had been done for centuries.Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A–C (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p. 108. Most of the army was composed of riflemen, a significant percentage of which were in Menelik's reserve; however, there were also a significant number of cavalry and infantry only armed with lances. The Kuban Cossack army officer N. S. Leontiev who visited Ethiopia in 1895,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1895/feb/28/russian-mission-to-abyssinia Russian Mission to Abyssina].[http://www.300.years.spb.ru/eng/3_spb_3.html?id64 Who Was Count Abai?]. according to some sources, led a small team of Russian advisers and volunteers.[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Aethiopien/Artamonov/framepred.htm Leonid Artamonov, a Russian general, geographer and traveler, military adviser of Menelik II, as one of Russian officers of volunteers attached to the forces of Ras Tessema (wrote: Through Ethiopia to the White Nile).][http://www.sworld.com.ua/index.php/ru/history/world-history-and-the-history-of-ukraine/768-vinogradova-kv The activities of the officer the Kuban Cossack army N.S. Leontjev in the Italian-Ethiopic war in 1895–1896][http://www.samizdat.com/armies.html – With the Armies of Menelik II by Alexander K. Bulatovich] Other sources assert that Leontiev did not in fact participate in the battle, rather he visited Ethiopia first unofficially in January 1895, and then officially as a representative of Russia in August 1895, but then left later that year, only to return after the battle of Adwa.Raymond Jonas, \"The Battle of Adwa\" (Harvard University Press, 2011), pp. 310–14.\n\nBattle \n\nOn the night of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades advanced separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped.Uhlig, Encyclopaedia, p. 109. David Levering Lewis states that the Italian battle plan: However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras Alula's position.\n\nUnbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael at the head of the Oromo cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve.Lewis, Fashoda, p. 117. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.\n\nAlbertone's Askari Brigade was the first to encounter the onrush of Ethiopians at 6:00, near Kidane Meret,In the attached map, this is labelled \"Chidane Meret\", which is immediately above (west) of the hill \"Rajò\". where the Ethiopians had managed to set up their mountain artillery. Accounts of the Ethiopian artillery deployed at Adwa differ; Russian advisor Leonid Artamonov wrote that it comprised forty-two Russian mountain guns supported by a team of fifteen advisers, but British historians suggest that the Ethiopian guns were Hotchkiss and Maxim pieces captured from the Egyptians or purchased from French and other European suppliers.Sean McLachlan, p. 37 \"Armies of the Adowa Campaign 1896\",  Albertone's heavily outnumbered Askaris held their position for two hours until Albertone's capture, and under Ethiopian pressure the survivors sought refuge with Arimondi's brigade. Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 Shewans and swamped the Italian defenders. Two companies of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.\n\nDabormida's Italian Brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian Army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting Ebalgume! Ebalgume! (\"Reap! Reap!\"). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, \"a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars\".George Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley, Campaign of Adowa (1902), quoted in Lewis, Fashoda, p. 118.\n\nThe remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of Mount Belah. Menelik watched as Gojjam forces under the command of Tekle Haymonot made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade. By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.\n\nImmediate aftermath \n\nThe Italians suffered about 7,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner. Brigadiers Dabormida and Arimondi were amongst the dead. Ethiopian losses have been estimated at around 4,000–5,000 killed and 8,000 wounded.Pankhurst. The Ethiopians, pp. 191–92. In their flight to Eritrea, the Italians left behind all of their artillery and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport. As Paul B. Henze notes, \"Baratieri's army had been completely annihilated while Menelik's was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians.\"Henze, Layers of Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 170. The 3,000 Italian prisoners, who included Brigadier Albertone, appear to have been treated as well as could be expected under difficult circumstances, though about 200 died of their wounds in captivity.Chris Prouty notes that Albertone was given into the care of Azaj Zamanel, commander of Empress Taytu's personal army, and \"had a tent to himself, a horse and servants\". Empress Taytu, pp. 169ff. However, 800 captured askaris, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, had their right hands and left feet amputated. Augustus Wylde records when he visited the battlefield months after the battle, the pile of severed hands and feet was still visible, \"a rotting heap of ghastly remnants.\"Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 213 Further, many had not survived their punishment, Wylde writing how the neighborhood of Adwa \"was full of their freshly dead bodies; they had generally crawled to the banks of the streams to quench their thirst, where many of them lingered unattended and exposed to the elements until death put an end to their sufferings.\"Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, p. 214 There does not appear to be any foundation for reports that some Italians were castrated and these may reflect confusion with the atrocious treatment of the askari prisoners.Prouty has collected the few documented experiences of these POWs, none of whom claim to have been treated inhumanely (Empress Taytu, pp. 170–83). She repeats the opinion of the Italian historian Angelo del Boca, that \"the paucity of the record is attributable to the glacial welcome received in Italy by the returning prisoners for having lost a war, and the fact that they were subjected to long interrogations when they debarked, were defrauded of their back pay, had their mementoes confiscated and were ordered not to talk to journalists\" (p. 170).\n\nBaratieri was relieved of his command and later charged with preparing an \"inexcusable\" plan of attack and for abandoning his troops in the field. He was acquitted on these charges but was described by the court martial judges as being \"entirely unfit\" for his command.\n\nPublic opinion in Italy was outraged.Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870–1900 (2010) Chris Prouty offers a panoramic overview of the response in Italy to the news:\n\nThe Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission. The Russian mission was a military mission conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik's Adwa victory.[http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html The Russian Red Cross Mission] \n\nFollow-up to Ethiopian victory \n\nEmperor Menelik decided not to follow up on his victory by attempting to drive the routed Italians out of their colony. The victorious Emperor limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale. In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal famine; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 176. At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that \"a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources.\"Prouty, Empress Taytu, p. 161. Lewis believes that it \"was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade\"Lewis, Fashoda, p. 120. that stayed his hand.\n\nAs a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa, recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the League of Nations's weak response to the Abyssinia Crisis, the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by Benito Mussolini, the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as chemical warfare, and the Ethiopian forces were defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936–41), before eventually being driven out during World War II by British Empire and Ethiopian Arbegnoch (patriot) forces.\n\nSignificance \n\n\"The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history,\" writes Henze.Henze, Layers of Layers of Time, p.180. On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde observed that \"few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa\".Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 81.\n\nThe Russian Empire had sold some artillery pieces to the Ethiopian forces and paid enthusiastic compliments to the Ethiopian success. One of the documents of that time stated \"The Victory immediately gained the general sympathy of Russian society and it continued to grow.\" The unique outlook which polyethnic Russia exhibited to Ethiopia disturbed many supporters of European nationalism during the twentieth century. The Russian Cossack captain Nikolay Leontiev with a small escort was present at the battle as an observer.[http://www.tvoros.ru/proza/kazaki-u-imperatora-menelika-vtorogo.html Cossacks of the emperor Menelik II]\n\nThis defeat of a colonial power and the ensuing recognition of African sovereignty became rallying points for later African nationalists during their struggle for decolonization, as well as activists and leaders of the Pan-African movement.Professor Kinfe Abraham, \"The Impact of the Adowa Victory on The Pan-African and Pan-Black Anti-Colonial Struggle,\" Address delivered to The Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, 8 February 2006 As the Afrocentric scholar Molefe Asante explains,\n\nOn the other hand, many writers have pointed out how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. One student of Ethiopia, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa \"became a national trauma which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935\". Levine also noted that the victory \"gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West – resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/Haile Selassie would have to contend\".[http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2009/03/the-battle-of-adwa-as-a-historic-event/ \"The Battle of Adwa as a 'Historic' Event\"], Ethiopian Review, 3 March 2009 (Retrieved 9 March 2009)\n\nContemporary celebrations of Adwa \n\nPublic holiday\n\nThe victory of Adwa, which is officially celebrated across Ethiopia on the 1st of March every year, marks the momentous victory that Ethiopia achieved against the invading Italian army on March 1, 1896. Most historians agree that the Battle of Adwa is the first inter-state conflict of its kind where an African army has definitively defeated a European army. Ethiopia’s decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa has inspired several African countries in their fight against European colonialism. On the 121st anniversary of Adwa, Ethiopian academic and social media contributor Wondwesen Tafesse posted a message on Facebook that reads, “Most nations have independence day, we [Ethiopians] have victory day. And, we call it…A D W A”.Wondwosen TE – most nations have independence day, we have.. (2017) Available at: https://www.facebook.com/wondwesen/posts/10155081782689324?hc_location=ufi (Accessed: 5 March 2017). This message resonated with the Ethiopian social media community, and has since been shared, retweeted and posted on different social media networking sites thousands of times. The message has inspired Ethiopians, and served as a motto during the 121st celebration of the Victory of Adwa on social media.\n\nThe Victory of Adwa is a public holiday in all regional states and charter cities across Ethiopia. All schools, banks, post offices and government offices are closed, with the exceptions of health facilities. Some taxi services and public transports choose not to operate on this day. Shops are normally open but most close earlier than usual.\n\nPublic celebrations\n\nThe Victory of Adwa, being a public holiday, is commemorated in public spaces. In Addis Ababa, the Victory of Adwa is celebrated at Menelik Square with the presence of government officials, patriots, foreign diplomats and the general public. Ethiopian Police Orchestra play various patriotic songs as they walk around Menelik Square.\n\nThe public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire. Men often wear Jodhpurs pants, various types of vest tops, and carry the Ethiopian flag, various patriotic banners and placards, and traditional Ethiopian shields and swords called Shotel. Women dress up in different patterns of handcrafted traditional Ethiopian clothing, known in Amharic as Habesha kemis. Some wear black gowns on top, while others put royal crowns on their head. Women’s dressing style, like their male counterparts, imitate the traditional style of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular note is the dominant presence of Empress Taytu Betul during these celebrations.\n\nEmpress Taytu Betul is the beloved and influential wife of Emperor Menelik II, who played a significant role during the Battle of Adwa. Although often overlooked, thousands of women fought during the Battle of Adwa alongside men. Some were trained as nurses to attend to the wounded, while others mainly cooked and supplied food and water to the soldiers and comforted the wounded.\n\nIn addition to Addis Ababa, other major cities in Ethiopia, including Bahir Dar, Debre Markos and the town of Adwa itself, where the Battle of Adwa took place, celebrate the Victory of Adwa in public ceremonies.\n\nSymbols\n\nSeveral images and symbols are used during the commemoration of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured Green, Gold and Red Ethiopian flag, images of Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul, as well as other prominent kings and war generals of the time including King Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, King Michael of Wollo, Dejazmach Balcha Safo, Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis Dinagde, and Fitawrari Gebeyehu, among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror Menelik II, Empress Taytu, Emperor Haile Selassie and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and patriotic songs are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are Ejigayehu Shibabaw’s ballad dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and Teddy Afro’s popular song “Tikur Sew”, which literally translates to “black man or black person” – a poetic reference to Emperor Menelik II’s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor’s darker skin complexion.\n\nFilm \n\n* Adwa – 1999 documentary film directed by Haile Gerima.
