They produced many of their films through their own production company, Charter Film Productions, which they set up in 1937.[http://www.imdb.com/company/co0103294/?ref_=ttco_co_4 IMDb: Charter Film Productions] Linked 2013-05-24\n\nEarly life\n\nThe twin brothers were born to Arthur Boulting and his wife Rosetta (Rose) née Bennett in Bray, Berkshire, England on 21 December 1913. John was the elder by half an hour. John was named Joseph Edward John Boulting and Roy was named Alfred Fitzroy Clarence Boulting. Their elder brother Sydney Boulting became an actor and stage producer as Peter Cotes; he was the original director of The Mousetrap. A younger brother, Guy, died aged eight. \n\nBoth twins were educated at Reading School, where they formed a film society. They were extras in Anthony Asquith's 1931 film Tell England while still at school. \n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, John served with the International Brigades as an ambulance driver.\n\nCareers\n\nThe brothers constitute one of those producer-director teams responsible for so much notable British cinema. For most of their careers, one produced while the other directed, but the product remained essentially a 'Boulting Brothers film'. They were socialistically inclined (John fought with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War), but despite a somewhat patrician demeanour, they wanted film to have serious connections with social reality.\nCharter Film Productions\n\nIn 1937, they set up Charter Film Productions and made several short features, including The Landlady (1937) and Consider Your Verdict (1938), which attracted critical and commercial attention.\n\nThey made quota quickies such as Trunk Crime (1939) and Inquest (1939).\nFeature Films\n\nBeing eager to speak out against the Third Reich, the brothers made their major film, Pastor Hall (1940), a biopic of Martin Niemöller, a German preacher who refuses to kowtow to the Nazis. Roy directed and John produced. The film had to have its initial release delayed by the British Government, which was not yet ready to be openly critical of Nazism. Once released, the film was well received by the critics and the public.\n\nThey followed it up with Thunder Rock (1942) with Michael Redgrave, a passionate anti-isolationist allegory distinguished by imaginative cinematography and a theatrical but highly atmospheric lighthouse setting. It was financed by MGM.\nService in the Military\n\nIn 1941 Roy joined the Army Film Unit, where he was responsible for the enormously influential Desert Victory - which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1944. He also worked on Tunisian Victory (1944) and Burma Victory (1945). \n\nJohn joined the RAF Film Unit, where he made Journey Together in 1945, a dramatised documentary about the training and combat experience of a bomber crew with Richard Attenborough in the lead part. Terence Rattigan worked on the script.\nPost War Films\n\nAfter the war the Boultings made the drama Fame Is the Spur (1947) with Redgrave. More popular was Brighton Rock (1947), starring Attenborough as the gangster \"Pinkie\" from the novel by Graham Greene, which has become a classic. \n\nAlso well liked was the comedy The Guinea Pig (1948), starring Richard Attenborough as a young working class boy sent to a public school. It was made for Pilgrim Pictures who the Boultings left shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Boultings co-directed the thriller Seven Days to Noon (1950), which won an Oscar for Best Story. It led to a less popular sequel, High Treason (1951).\n\nJohn directed The Magic Box (1951), a biopic of William Friese-Greene notable for the number of cameos in its cast. It was a box office disappointment.\n\nHollywood-Financed Films\n\nRoy received an offer to direct a World War Two naval film, Sailor of the King (1953), starring Jeffrey Hunter for 20th Century Fox. Seagulls Over Sorrento (1954) was another war naval story financed by a Hollywood studio (in this case MGM) with an imported star (Gene Kelly); it was not a big success.\n\nThe brothers collaborated on a comedy, Josephine and Men (1955) then Roy was hired by United Artists to do an action film with Hollywood stars, Run for the Sun (1956).\n\nSatires\n\nIn the mid-50s the Boultings quickly became identified with \"affectionate\"  satires on various British institutions. it started with John's Private's Progress (1956), a look at army life, starring Attenborough, Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael and co written by Frank Harvey.
