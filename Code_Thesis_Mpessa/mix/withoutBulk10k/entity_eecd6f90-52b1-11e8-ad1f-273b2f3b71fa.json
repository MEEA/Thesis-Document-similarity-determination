  "textBody" : "The demographics of Ethiopia encompass the demographic features of Ethiopia's inhabitants, including ethnicity, languages, population density, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nEthnic groups\n\n \n\nThe country's population is highly diverse, comprising over 80 different ethnic groups. Most people in Ethiopia speak Afroasiatic languages, mainly of the Semitic or Cushitic branches. Among these are the Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans, who together constitute around three-quarters of the population.\n\nNilo-Saharan-speaking Nilotic ethnic minorities also inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas bordering South Sudan. Among these are the Mursi and Anuak.\n\nLanguages\n\nThere are 90 individual languages spoken in Ethiopia. The 1994 Ethiopian census indicates that some 77 tongues were spoken locally. Most of these languages belong to the Afroasiatic family (Cushitic and Semitic). Omotic languages are also spoken, though their classification is uncertain. Additionally, Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities.\n\nThe most widely spoken languages are Oromo (34.4%), Amharic (27%), Somali (6.2%), and Tigrinya (6.1%).\n\nAmharic is the only official national language of Ethiopia. It was also the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by local languages such as Oromo and Tigrinya. English is the most widely spoken foreign language, and is officially taught in all secondary schools.\n\nReligions\n\nVarious religions are adhered to in Ethiopia. Most Christians live in the highlands, whereas Muslims mainly inhabit the lowlands. Adherents of traditional faiths are primarily concentrated in the southern regions.\n\nAccording to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2007 census), the national religious composition is Orthodox 43.5%, Protestant 18.6%, Catholic 0.7%, Muslim 33.9%, traditional 2.6%, and others 0.6%.\n\nPopulation\n\nSource: Central Statistical Agency (CSA) \n\nUN estimates\n\nAccording to , the total population was  in , compared to 18,434,000 in 1950.
