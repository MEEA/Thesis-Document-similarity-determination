  "textBody" : "In Christianity, docetism (from the Greek  dokeĩn (to seem) dókēsis (apparition, phantom),: \"A term derived from the Greek dokein, to seem, or to appear.\". is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality... Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion. The word  Dokētaí (illusionists) referring to early groups who denied Jesus' humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197–203), who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery... Serapion first approved its use, and only reversed his opinion on returning to his bishopric in Antioch, after being informed of its contents. He wrote a \"Concerning the So-Called Gospel of St Peter\", which is alluded to in Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica VI 12.3–6. It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: \"the Word was made Flesh\"..\n\nDocetism was unequivocally rejected at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. and is regarded as heretical by the Catholic Church, Orthodox Church, and Coptic Church..\n\nDefinitions\n\nDocetism is broadly defined as any teaching that claims that Jesus' body was either absent or illusory. The term 'docetic' is rather nebulous..: \"N Brox has expressed himself emphatically against a widespread nebulous use of the term, and has sought an exact definition which links up with the original usage (e.g. in Clement of Alexandria). Docetism is 'the doctrine according to which the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality.'\" For Robert Price \"docetism\", together with  \"encratism\", \"Gnosticism\" and \"adoptionism\", has been employed \"far beyond what historically descriptive usage would allow\".. Two varieties were widely known. In one version, as in Marcionism, Christ was so divine that he could not have been human, since God lacked a material body, which therefore could not physically suffer. Jesus only appeared to be a flesh-and-blood man; his body was a phantasm. Other groups who were accused of docetism held that Jesus was a man in the flesh, but Christ was a separate entity who entered Jesus's body in the form of a dove at his baptism, empowered him to perform miracles, and abandoned him upon his death on the cross.\n\nChristology and theological implications\n\nDocetism's origin within Christianity is obscure. Ernst Käsemann controversially defined the Christology of St John’s Gospel as \"naïve docetism\" in 1968.. The ensuing debate reached an impasse as awareness grew that the very term \"docetism\", like \"gnosticism\", was difficult to define within the religio-historical framework of the debate. It has occasionally been argued that its origins were in heterodox Judaism or Oriental and Grecian philosophies.. The alleged connection with Jewish Christianity would have reflected Jewish Christian concerns with the inviolability of (Jewish) monotheism.. Docetic opinions seem to have circulated from very early times, 1 John 4:2 appearing explicitly to reject them. Some 1stcentury Christian groups developed docetic interpretations partly as a way to make Christian teachings more acceptable to pagan ways of thinking about divinity..\n\nIn his critique of the theology of Clement of Alexandria, Photius in his Myriobiblon held that Clement's views reflected a quasi-docetic view of the nature of Christ, writing that \"[Clement] hallucinates that the Word was not incarnate but only seems to be.\" (ὀνειροπολεῖ καὶ μὴ σαρκωθῆναι τὸν λόγον ἀλλὰ δόξαι.)  In Clement’s time, some disputes contended over whether Christ assumed the \"psychic\" flesh of mankind as heirs to Adam, or the \"spiritual\" flesh of the resurrection. citing . Docetism largely died out during the first millennium AD.\n\nThe opponents against whom Ignatius of Antioch inveighs are often taken to be Monophysite docetists.. In his letter to the Smyrnaeans, 7:1, written around 110AD, he writes:\n \nWhile these characteristics fit a Monophysite framework, a slight majority of scholars consider that Ignatius was waging a polemic on two distinct fronts, one Jewish, the other docetic; a minority holds that he was concerned with a group that commingled Judaism and docetism. Others, however, doubt that there was actual docetism threatening the churches, arguing that he was merely criticizing Christians who lived Jewishly or that his critical remarks were directed at an Ebionite or Cerinthian possessionist Christology, according to which Christ was a heavenly spirit that temporarily possessed Jesus..\n\nIslam and docetism\n\nThe Qur'an has a docetic Christology, viewing Jesus as a divine illuminator rather than the redeemer (as he is viewed in Christianity). However, the Islamic docetism is not focused on the general life and person of Jesus or the Christ. In Islam \"the Christ\" (al-masīḥ) is not generally viewed as distinct from humanity nor a special spirit being as in docetism or some gnosticisms. Islamic docetism focuses on a denial of the crucifixion of Jesus. Sura 4:157–58 reads:\n\nDocetism and Christ myth theory\n\nSince Arthur Drews published his The Christ Myth (Die Christusmythe) in 1909, occasional connections have been drawn between docetist theories and the modern idea that Christ was a myth. Shailer Mathews called Drews' theory a \"modern docetism\". Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare thought any connection to be based on a misunderstanding of docetism. The idea recurred in classicist Michael Grant's 1977 review of the evidence for Jesus, who compared modern scepticism about a historical Jesus to the ancient docetic idea that Jesus only seemed to come into the world \"in the flesh\".
