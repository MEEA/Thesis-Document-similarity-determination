  "textBody" : "In thermodynamics, the term exothermic process (exo- : \"outside\") describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings, usually in the form of heat, but also in a form of light (e.g. a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e.g. a battery), or sound (e.g. explosion heard when burning hydrogen). Its etymology stems from the Greek prefix έξω (exō, which means \"outwards\") and the Greek word θερμικός (thermikόs, which means \"thermal\").[http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82&dq\n \"Gate for the Greek language\" on-line dictionary] . greek-language.gr The term exothermic was first coined by Marcellin Berthelot.
