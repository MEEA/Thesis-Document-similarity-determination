The enabling legislation consists of Acadia University Act  and the Amended Acadia University Act 2000.\n\nThe Wolfville Campus houses Acadia University Archives [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100430162327/http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/GetMuseumProfile.do?langen&chinCode\nguaarl Acadia University Archives] and the Acadia University Art Gallery.[http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/GetMuseumProfile.do?langen&chinCode\nguaarm. Acadia University Art Gallery] Acadia offers over 200 degree combinations in the Faculties of Arts, Pure and Applied Science, Professional Studies, and Theology. The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28. Open Acadia offers correspondence and distance education courses.\n\nHistory\n\n Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in Horton, Nova Scotia, by Baptists from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838). The College was later named Acadia College. Acadia University, established at Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1838 has a strong Baptist religious affiliation.\nIt was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.\n\nThe two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by denominational structures. King's College (University of King's College) was an Anglican school and Dalhousie University, which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the Church of Scotland. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of Classics, as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a college established and run by the Baptists.\n\nIn 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The college began with 21 students in January 1839. The name \"Queen's College\" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed \"Acadia College\" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an Acadian settlement. Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891, established by the Acadia University Act.\n\nThe Granville Street Baptist Church (now First Baptist Church (Halifax)) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the university. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president John Pryor, were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation. Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.\n\nThe original charter of the college stated:\n\nThis was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.\n\nIn 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.\n\nCharles Osborne Wickenden (architect) and J.C. Dumaresq designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79.\n\nClara Belle Marshall, from Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia, became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.\n\nIn 1891, there were changes in the Act of Incorporation.\n\nAndrew R. Cobb designed several campus buildings including: Raynor Hall Residence, 1916; [http://virtualtour.acadiau.ca/horton-hall.html Horton House], designed by Cobb in the Georgian style, and built by James Reid of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia was opened in 1915 as Horton Academy. Today, Horton Hall is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies.  Emmerson Hall, built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used. In 1967 Emmerson Hall was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education. It is a registered Heritage Property. \n\nUnveiled on 16 August 1963, a wooden and metal organ in Manning Chapel, Acadia University, is dedicated to Acadia University's war dead of the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War.

Her resignation was effective 29 February 2008. Ray Ivany began his position as President and Vice-Chancellor on 1 April 2009.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, it was announced that Ray Ivany would be leaving his post as President of Acadia University at the end of the 2017 academic year. In a statement provided to The Chronicle Herald, Ivany wrote \"I came to Acadia in 2009 because I respected the institution’s history, the faculty and staff who had established its reputation, its alumni who care deeply about the university, and its students who, year after year, earn awards and recognition for their work. In my time here, I have discovered the same Acadia magic that attracts students from around the world\".\n\nAs of July 2017, Peter J. Ricketts is the current president.\n\nFaculty strikes\n\nAcadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164641/http://www2.acadiau.ca/acadia-news-reader/items/board-and-faculty-sign-new-four-year-contract.html collective agreement news release] covering the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2014. The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution. The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004. The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007. The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister, Mark Parent, appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement.\n\nAcademics\n\nProfile\n\nAs a primarily undergraduate institution, the university places significant importance on teaching and instruction.\n\nRankings\n\nAcadia University is consistently ranked among the top universities in Canada for undergraduate studies in the Maclean's comprehensive Canadian Universities rankings, coming second in Canada for the 2014 academic year and among the top five for the past decade. This has been attributed to Acadia's small class size and close relationships between the faculty and the students.\n\nFaculties\n\nAcadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure & Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology. Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research.\n\nResearch\n\nThe Division of Research & Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.\n\nAcadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness. Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, the Acadia Institute for Data Analytics, and the Beaubassin Field Station. Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies.\n\nInnovation\n\nThe Acadia Advantage\n\nIn 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.\n\nThis academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.\n\nBecause of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History. It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.\n\nIn addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing. In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual Maclean's University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.\n\nIn October 2006, Dr. Dinter-Gottlieb established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception. The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere. The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.\n\nSome of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model. The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.\n\nThe University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.  In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.\n\nAthletics\n\nAcadia's sports teams are called the Axemen and Axewomen. They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of U Sports.\n\nSchool spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport. Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.\n\nExpansion and modernization of Raymond Field was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the National Football League for its main playing field. The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province. War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.\n\nIn September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club  and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus. On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.\n\nFight song\n\nNotable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: Stand Up and Cheer, the Acadia University fight song. According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater - Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.'\n\nSymbols\n\nIn 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England. The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield. The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour. The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.  \"In pulvere vinces\" (In dust you conquer) is the motto.[http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/research/fta/oct297.html Acadia University's Coat of Arms] \n\nThe University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615184810/http://www.acadiau.ca/chaplain/window.htm Description of stained glass windows in Manning Memorial Chapel. The seal is described in the third lancet, fourth panel.]\n\nThe University also uses a stylized \"A\" as a logo for its sports teams.\n\nNotable among a number of fight songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: the Acadia University alma mater set to the tune of \"Annie Lisle\". The lyrics are:\n\nFar above the dykes of Fundy\nAnd its basin blue\nStands our noble alma mater\nGlorious to view\n\nLift the chorus\nSpeed it onward\nSing it loud and free\nHail to thee our alma mater\nAcadia, hail to thee\n\nFar above the busy highway\nAnd the sleepy town\nRaised against the arch of heaven\nLooks she proudly down\n\nHistoric buildings at Acadia University\n\nSeminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a Second Empire style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university.  It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 as Canada's oldest facility associated with the higher education of women.\n\nCarnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building.  It was designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1989 as its construction in 1909 signified Acadia's evolution from classical college to liberal university.\n\nThe War Memorial House (more generally known as Barrax), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium   are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University. The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead.  The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War. \n\nStudent life\n\nAt Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations. The building also houses The Axe Lounge, a convenience store, an information desk and two food outlets. The university press, The Athenaeum, is a member of CUP.\n\nStudent government\n\nAll students are represented by the Acadia Students' Union. \nThe Union Executive for the 2017-2018 academic year: President - Grace Hamilton-Burge, Vice President Student Life - Emily Murray, Vice President Academic & External - Samantha Nixon, Vice President Finance - Liam Schreiter, Vice President Events & Promotions - Malcolm Anderson.[http://theasu.ca/who-we-are/executive-leadership-team/ Acadia Students' Union - Executive Leadership Team] The student newspaper is The Athenaeum.\n\nResidences\n\nApproximately 1500 students live on-campushttp://parents.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/parents/PDF/December%20%202012%20Newsletter.pdf in 12 residences:http://residencelife.acadiau.ca/residences2.html\n* Chase Court\n* Cutten House\n* Roy Jodrey Hall\n* Eaton House\n* Christofor Hall\n* Chipman House\n* Dennis House - First floor houses student health services\n* Whitman Hall (Tully) - All female residence\n* Seminary House - Also houses the School of Education in lower level\n* War Memorial (Barrax) House\n* Raymond House\n* Crowell Tower (13 Story High-rise)\n* Willett House (former residence)[https://archive.is/20070629073846/http://admin.acadiau.ca/studentaffairs/residencelife/newsletter0907.html Residence Life Newsletter: September 2007]\n\nPeople\n\nList of Presidents and Vice Chancellors\n\n* John Pryor, 1846–1850\n* John Cramp, 1851–1853 (and 1856–1869)\n* Edmund Crawley, 1853–1856\n* John Cramp, 1856–1869\n* Artemas Wyman Sawyer, 1869–1896\n* Thomas Trotter, 1897–1906\n* W.B.

War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.\n\nIn September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club  and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus. On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.\n\nFight song\n\nNotable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: Stand Up and Cheer, the Acadia University fight song. According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater - Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.'\n\nSymbols\n\nIn 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England. The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield. The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour. The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.  \"In pulvere vinces\" (In dust you conquer) is the motto.[http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/research/fta/oct297.html Acadia University's Coat of Arms] \n\nThe University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615184810/http://www.acadiau.ca/chaplain/window.htm Description of stained glass windows in Manning Memorial Chapel. The seal is described in the third lancet, fourth panel.]\n\nThe University also uses a stylized \"A\" as a logo for its sports teams.\n\nNotable among a number of fight songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: the Acadia University alma mater set to the tune of \"Annie Lisle\". The lyrics are:\n\nFar above the dykes of Fundy\nAnd its basin blue\nStands our noble alma mater\nGlorious to view\n\nLift the chorus\nSpeed it onward\nSing it loud and free\nHail to thee our alma mater\nAcadia, hail to thee\n\nFar above the busy highway\nAnd the sleepy town\nRaised against the arch of heaven\nLooks she proudly down\n\nHistoric buildings at Acadia University\n\nSeminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a Second Empire style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university.  It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 as Canada's oldest facility associated with the higher education of women.\n\nCarnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building.  It was designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1989 as its construction in 1909 signified Acadia's evolution from classical college to liberal university.\n\nThe War Memorial House (more generally known as Barrax), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium   are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University. The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead.  The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War. \n\nStudent life\n\nAt Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations.
