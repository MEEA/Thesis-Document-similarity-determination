The site was excavated between 1897 and 1907 and again from 1976 to 1978.  Remains are no longer visible and are buried beneath cultivated farmland. The first coin credited to Commius that was found in an excavated context was found at the temple. This Commius was probably the son of the Commius mentioned by Julius Caesar in his writings although its possible the coin was issued by the original Commius.\n\nSalt production was an industry on the island from the 11th century (the Domesday Book records a saltpan on the island for this purpose) until the late 19th century.\n\nConstruction of Northwode Chapel by the monks of Jumièges, Normandy, began in about 1140; this became the present St Peter's Church and is now the oldest surviving church on the island. It has been claimed that St Peter's three bells, cast in about 1350, have one of the oldest peals in England. St Mary's Church is a standard design of the churches of its era, but upon close examination the walls have been constructed from a mortar of local shells and beach pebbles. The ancient yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be the oldest yew in the country, with a girth of some 9 m. Although estimates as to its age vary, they range from over a thousand to nearly two thousand years old.[http://www.hayling.co.uk/guides/historic/stmaryschurch.php St. Mary's Church] Hayling Council website.

No injuries were reported.\n\nGeography\n\nHayling Island is a true island, completely surrounded by sea.  Looking at its north to south orientation, it is shaped like an inverted T, about  long and  wide. A road bridge connects its northern end to the mainland of England at Langstone.  The Hayling Ferry is a small pedestrian ferry connecting to the Eastney area of the city of Portsmouth on the neighbouring Portsea Island. To the west is Langstone Harbour and to the east is Chichester Harbour.\n\nThe natural beach at Hayling was predominantly sandy, but in recent years it has been mechanically topped with shingle dredged from the bed of the Solent in an effort to reduce beach erosion and reduce the potential to flood low-lying land. At low tide, the East Winner sandbank is visible, extending a mile out to sea. The coastline in this area has substantially changed since Roman times: it is believed much land has been lost from the coasts of Hayling and Selsey by erosion and subsequent flooding.\n\nClimate\n\nAs with the rest of the British Isles and Southern England, Hayling Island experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Temperatures have never fallen into double figures below freezing, illustrating the relative warmth of the island – comparable to the far southwest of England and its neighbour, the Isle of Wight. Temperature extremes between 1960 and 2010 have ranged from  during January 1963,  up to  during June 1976.\n\nSport and leisure\n\nHayling Island has a non-League football club, Hayling United F.C., which plays at Hayling Park.\n\nAlthough largely residential, Hayling is also a holiday, windsurfing and sailing centre, the site where windsurfing was invented.\n\nIn summer 2010, the Hayling Island Sailing Club hosted the 2010 World Laser Standard Senior and Junior Championships (27 August-5 September). The Senior championship was won by Australian Tom Slingsby, whilst Dane Thorbjoern Schierup won the Junior competition.http://www.hisc.co.uk/news/news10/019_laser_worlds.htm Today it is a home to many different types of sailing, including a growing [http://www.hisc.co.uk/sailing-racing/hisc-classes/fireball/ Fireball] fleet.\n\nAs a consequence of the island's popularity for water activities, there are two lifeboat services: Hayling Island Lifeboat Station, run by the RNLI and Hayling Island Rescue Service, an independent service run by retired RNLI helmsman, Frank Dunster.\n\nThe island hosts one of the few active Real Tennis courts in the UK. Founded in 1911, Seacourt Tennis club is one of only a handful in the UK where it is possible to play every recognised racquet sport. The racquets court itself was opened by Sir Colin Cowdrey.\n\nSeacourt Tennis Club also hosts a weekly fencing club featuring all ages, levels and weapons.\n\nHayling Golf Club has been voted in the top 100 golf courses in the UK. A traditional links course, although relatively short by modern standards, the strong prevailing south-westerly winds, fast greens, gorse bushes and traditional deep links bunkers make this a stern test for any golfer.\n\nFunland, an amusement park situated at Beachlands, is open year-round, as is the East Hayling Light Railway which runs from the funfair to Eastoke corner.\n\nThe 5 mi Hayling Billy Trail is a former light rail right-of-way  which has been converted to one of many footpaths on the island.[http://www.hayling.co.uk/guides/historic/billytrail.php Coastal Path - Billy Trail].
