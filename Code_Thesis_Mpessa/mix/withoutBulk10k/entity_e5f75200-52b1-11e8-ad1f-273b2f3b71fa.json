The following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists.\n\nSeparable first-order ordinary differential equations \n\nEquations in the form \\frac {dy}{dx} f(x)g(y) are called separable and solved by \\frac {dy}{g(y)} \n f(x)dx and thus \n\\int\\frac {dy}{g(y)} = \\int f(x)dx. Prior to dividing by g(y), one needs to check if there are stationary (also called equilibrium)\nsolutions yconst satisfying g(y)\n0.\n\nSeparable (homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations\n\nA separable linear ordinary differential equation of the first order \nmust be homogeneous and has the general form\n\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = 0\n\nwhere f(t) is some known function.  We may solve this by separation of variables (moving the y terms to one side and the t terms to the other side),\n\n\\frac{dy}{y} = -f(t)\\, dt\n\nSince the separation of variables in this case involves dividing by y, we must check if the constant function y0 is a solution of the original equation. Trivially, if y\n0 then y'0, so y\n0 is actually a solution of the original equation. We note that y=0 is not allowed in the transformed equation.\n\nWe solve the transformed equation with the variables already separated by Integrating,\n\n\\ln |y| = \\left(-\\int f(t)\\,dt\\right) + C\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant. Then, by exponentiation, we obtain\n\ny \\pm e^{\\left(-\\int f(t)\\,dt\\right) + C} \n \\pm e^{C} e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt}.\n\nHere, e^{C}>0, so \\pm e^{C}\\neq 0. But we have independently checked that y=0 is also a solution of the original equation, thus \ny = A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt}.\nwith an arbitrary constant A, which covers all the cases. It is easy to confirm that this is a solution by plugging it into the original differential equation:\n\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y -f(t) \\cdot A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt} + f(t) \\cdot A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt} \n 0\n\nSome elaboration is needed because ƒ(t)  might not even be integrable. One must also assume something about the domains of the functions involved before the equation is fully defined. The solution above assumes the real case.\n\nIf f(t)\\alpha is a constant, the solution is particularly simple, y \n A e^{-\\alpha t} and describes, e.g., if \\alpha>0, the exponential decay of radioactive material at the macroscopic level. If the value of \\alpha is not known a priori, it can be determined from two measurements of the solution. For example,\n\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\alpha y 0, y(1)\n2, y(2)=1\n\ngives \\alpha ln(2) and y \n 4 e^{-ln(2) t}= 2^{2-t}.\n\nNon-separable (non-homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations\n\nFirst-order linear non-homogeneous ODEs (ordinary differential equations) are not separable. They can be solved by the following approach, known as an integrating factor method. Consider first-order linear ODEs of the general form:\n\n\\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)\n\nThe method for solving this equation relies on a special integrating factor, μ:\n\n\\mu = e^{\\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\\, dt}\n\nWe choose this integrating factor because it has the special property that its derivative is itself times the function we are integrating, that is:\n\n\\frac{d{\\mu}}{dx} e^{\\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\\, dt} \\cdot p(x) \n \\mu p(x)\n\nMultiply both sides of the original differential equation by μ to get:\n\n\\mu{\\frac{dy}{dx}} + \\mu{p(x)y}  = \\mu{q(x)}\n\nBecause of the special μ we picked, we may substitute dμ/dx for μ p(x), simplifying the equation to:\n\n\\mu{\\frac{dy}{dx}} + y{\\frac{d{\\mu}}{dx}} = \\mu{q(x)}\n\nUsing the product rule in reverse, we get:\n\n\\frac{d}{dx}{(\\mu{y})} = \\mu{q(x)}\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n\\mu{y} = \\left(\\int\\mu q(x)\\, dx\\right) + C\n\nFinally, to solve for y we divide both sides by \\mu:\n\ny = \\frac{\\left(\\int\\mu q(x)\\, dx\\right) + C}{\\mu}\n\nSince μ is a function of x, we cannot simplify any further directly.\n\nSecond-order linear ordinary differential equations\n\nA simple example\n\nSuppose a mass is attached to a spring which exerts an attractive force on the mass proportional to the extension/compression of the spring. For now, we may ignore any other forces (gravity, friction, etc.).  We shall write the extension of the spring at a time t as x(t).  Now, using Newton's second law we can write (using convenient units):\n\nm\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +kx=0,\n\nwhere m is the mass and k is the spring constant that represents a measure of spring stiffness. For simplicity's sake, let us take m=k as an example.\n\nIf we look for solutions that have the form Ce^{\\lambda t}, where C is a constant, we discover the relationship \\lambda^2+1=0, and thus \\lambda must be one of the complex numbers i or -i.  Thus, using Euler's theorem we can say that the solution must be of the form:\n\nx(t) = A \\cos t + B \\sin t\n\nSee a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x solution] by WolframAlpha.\n\nTo determine the unknown constants A and B,  we need initial conditions, i.e. equalities that specify the state of the system at a given time (usually t = 0).\n\nFor example, if we suppose at t  0 the extension is a unit distance (x \n 1), and the particle is not moving (dx/dt = 0). We have\n\nx(0) A \\cos 0 + B \\sin 0 \n A = 1, \n\nand so A = 1.\n\nx'(0) -A \\sin 0 + B \\cos 0 \n B = 0, \n\nand so B = 0.\n\nTherefore x(t) = cos t.  This is an example of simple harmonic motion.\n\nSee a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x%2Cx%280%29%3D1%2Cx%27%280%29%3D0 solution] by Wolfram Alpha.\n\nA more complicated model\n\nThe above model of an oscillating mass on a spring is plausible but not very realistic: in practice, friction will tend to decelerate the mass and have magnitude proportional to its velocity (i.e. dx/dt).  Our new differential equation, expressing the balancing of the acceleration and the forces, is\n\nm\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c \\frac{dx}{dt} + kx=0,\n\nwhere c is the damping coefficient representing  friction.  Again looking for solutions of the form Ce^{\\lambda t}, we find that\n\nm\\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0. \n\nThis is a quadratic equation which we can solve.  If c^2 there are two complex conjugate  roots a ± ib, and the solution (with the above boundary conditions) will look like this:\n\nx(t) = e^{at} \\left(\\cos bt - \\frac{a}{b} \\sin bt \\right) \n\nLet us for simplicity take m1, then 0 and k=a^2+b^2.\n\nThe equation can be also solved in MATLAB symbolic toolbox as\n\nx dsolve('D2x+c*Dx+k*x\n0','x(0)1','Dx(0)\n0')\n\nalthough the solution looks rather ugly,\n\nx = (c + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)) - \n    (c - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))\n\nThis is a model of damped oscillator. The plot of displacement against time would look like this:\n\nwhich resembles how one would expect a vibrating spring to behave as friction removes energy from the system.\n\nLinear systems of ODEs\n\nThe following example of a first order linear systems of ODEs\n y_1'=y_1+2y_2+t\n y_2'=2y_1-2y_2+\\sin(t)\n\ncan be easily symbolically \n[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%27+%3D+%2C.y%2B+{t%2C+sin%28t%29} solved]\nin WolframAlpha.",
