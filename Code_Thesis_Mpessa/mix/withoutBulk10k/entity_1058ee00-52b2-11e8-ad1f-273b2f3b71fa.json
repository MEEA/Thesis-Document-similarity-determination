  "textBody" : "William Heath Robinson (31 May 1872 – 13 September 1944) was an English cartoonist and illustrator best known for drawings of ridiculously complicated machines for achieving simple objectives.Bryant, Mark. World War I in Cartoons. London: Grub Street Pub, 2006, page 17, \n\nIn the UK, the term \"Heath Robinson\" entered the  popular language during the 1914–1918 First World War as a description of any unnecessarily complex and implausible contrivance, much as \"Rube Goldberg machines\" came to be used in the United States from the 1920s onwards as a term for similar efforts. \"Heath Robinson contraption\" is perhaps more often used in relation to temporary fixes using ingenuity and whatever is to hand, often string and tape, or unlikely cannibalisations. Its continuing popularity was undoubtedly linked to Britain's shortages and the need to \"make do and mend\" during the Second World War.\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliam Heath Robinson was born at 25 Ennis Road on 31 May 1872 into a family of artists in an area of London known as Stroud Green, Finsbury Park, north London. His father Thomas Robinson (1838–1902) and brothers Thomas Heath Robinson (1869–1954)  and Charles Robinson (1870–1937) all worked as illustrators.\n\nCareer \n\nHis early career involved illustrating books – among others: Hans Christian Andersen's Danish Fairy Tales and Legends (1897), The Arabian Nights (1899), Tales from Shakespeare (1902), Gargantua and Pantagruel (1904),The Works of Mr. Francis Rabelais published by Grant Richards, London, 1904. Reprinted by The Navarre Society, London, 1921 Twelfth Night (1908), Andersen's Fairy Tales (1913), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1914), Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies (1915) and Walter de la Mare's Peacock Pie (1916).\n\nIn the course of his work, Robinson also wrote and illustrated three children's books, The Adventures of Uncle Lubin (1902), Bill the Minder (1912) and Peter Quip in Search of a Friend (1922). Uncle Lubin is regarded as the start of his career in the depiction of unlikely machines.\n\nDuring the First World War, he drew large numbers of cartoons, depicting ever-more-unlikely secret weapons being used by the combatants.  He also depicted the American Expeditionary Force in France.Bryant, Mark. World War I in Cartoons. London: Grub Street Pub, 2006, pages 9 and 17, \n\nHe also produced a steady stream of humorous drawings for magazines and advertisements. In 1934 he published a collection of his favourites as Absurdities, such as:\n\n*\"The Wart Chair. A simple apparatus for removing a wart from the top of the head\"\n*\"Resuscitating stale railway scones for redistribution at the station buffets\"\n*\"The multimovement tabby silencer\", which automatically threw water at serenading cats\n\nMost of his cartoons have since been reprinted many times in multiple collections.\n\nThe machines he drew were frequently powered by steam boilers or kettles, heated by candles or a spirit lamp and usually kept running by balding, bespectacled men in overalls. There would be complex pulley arrangements, threaded by lengths of knotted string. Robinson's cartoons were so popular that in Britain the term \"Heath Robinson\" is used to refer to an improbable, rickety machine barely kept going by incessant tinkering. (The corresponding term in the U.S. is Rube Goldberg, after the American cartoonist born just over a decade later, with an equal devotion to odd machinery. Similar \"inventions\" have been drawn by cartoonists in many countries, with the Danish Storm Petersen being on par with Robinson and Goldberg.)\n\nOne of his most famous series of illustrations was that which accompanied the first Professor Branestawm book written by Norman Hunter. The stories told of the eponymous professor who was brilliant, eccentric and forgetful and provided a perfect backdrop for Robinson's drawings.\n\nThe last project Robinson worked on shortly before he died was illustrations for Lilian M. Clopet's short story collection Once Upon a Time, which was published in 1944.https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22713/lot/165/\n\nOne of the automatic analysis machines built for Bletchley Park during the Second World War to assist in the decryption of German message traffic was named \"Heath Robinson\" in his honour. It was a direct predecessor to the Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.\n\nPersonal life \n\nIn 1903 he married Josephine Latey, the daughter of newspaper editor John Latey.[http://www.brinsmead.net/HeathRob.htm The Heath Robinson Connection] at www.brinsmead.net Heath Robinson moved to Pinner, Middlesex, in 1908. His house in Moss Lane is commemorated by a blue plaque.\n\nDeath and legacy \n\nHe died in September 1944 during the Second World War and is buried in East Finchley Cemetery.\n\nThe Heath Robinson Museum opened in October 2016 to house a collection of nearly 1,000 original artworks owned by The William Heath Robinson Trust. The museum is in Memorial Park, Pinner, close to where the artist lived and worked. A nearby branch of the PizzaExpress restaurants features designs inspired by the artist's work.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe name \"Heath Robinson\" became part of common parlance in the UK for complex inventions that achieved absurdly simple results following its use as services slang during the 1914–1918 First World War.[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hea4.htm World Wide Words: Heath Robinson]\n\nIn the Wallace and Gromit movies, Wallace often invents Heath Robinson-like machines, with some inventions being direct references.\n\nDuring the Falklands War (1982), British Harrier aircraft lacked their conventional \"chaff\"-dispensing mechanism.\n\nTherefore, Royal Navy engineers designed an impromptu delivery system of welding rods, split pins and string which allowed six packets of chaff to be stored in the speedbrake well and deployed in flight. Due to its improvised and ramshackle nature it was often referred to as the \"Heath Robinson chaff modification\".\n\nPublications\n\n*Robinson, W.
