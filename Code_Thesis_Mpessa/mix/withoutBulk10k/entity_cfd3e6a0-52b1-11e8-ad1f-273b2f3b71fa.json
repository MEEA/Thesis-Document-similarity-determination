  "textBody" : "In elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.  According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial  into a sum involving terms of the form , where the exponents  and  are nonnegative integers with , and the coefficient  of each term is a specific positive integer depending on  and .  For example,\n\n(x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4 x^3y + 6 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^3 + y^4.\n\nThe coefficient  in the term of  is known as the binomial coefficient \\tbinom nb or \\tbinom nc (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying  and  can be arranged to form Pascal's triangle. These numbers also arise in combinatorics, where \\tbinom nb gives the number of different combinations of  elements that can be chosen from an -element set.\n\nHistory\n\nSpecial cases of the binomial theorem were known since at least the 4th century B.C. when Greek mathematician Euclid mentioned the special case of the binomial theorem for exponent 2.  There is evidence that the binomial theorem for cubes was known by the 6th century in India.\n\nBinomial coefficients, as combinatorial quantities expressing the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n without replacement, were of interest to the ancient Hindus.  The earliest known reference to this combinatorial problem is the Chandaḥśāstra by the Hindu lyricist Pingala (c. 200 B.C.), which contains a method for its solution.  The commentator Halayudha from the 10th century A.D. explains this method using what is now known as Pascal's triangle.  By the 6th century A.D., the Hindu mathematicians probably knew how to express this as a quotient \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}, and a clear statement of this rule can be found in the 12th century text Lilavati by Bhaskara.\n\nThe binomial theorem as such can be found in the work of 11th-century Persian mathematician Al-Karaji, who described the triangular pattern of the binomial coefficients.  He also provided a mathematical proof of both the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, using an early form of mathematical induction.   The Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam was probably familiar with the formula to higher orders, although many of his mathematical works are lost.  The binomial expansions of small degrees were known in the 13th century mathematical works of Yang Hui and also Chu Shih-Chieh.  Yang Hui attributes the method to a much earlier 11th century text of Jia Xian, although those writings are now also lost.\n\nIn 1544, Michael Stifel introduced the term \"binomial coefficient\" and showed how to use them to express (1+a)^n in terms of (1+a)^{n-1}, via \"Pascal's triangle\".  Blaise Pascal studied the eponymous triangle comprehensively in the treatise Traité du triangle arithmétique (1653). However, the pattern of numbers was already known to the European mathematicians of the late Renaissance,  including Stifel, Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, and Simon Stevin.\n\nIsaac Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent.\n\nTheorem statement \n\nAccording to the theorem, it is possible\nto expand any power of x + y into a sum of the form\n(x+y)^n = {n \\choose 0}x^n y^0 + {n \\choose 1}x^{n-1}y^1 + {n \\choose 2}x^{n-2}y^2 + \\cdots + {n \\choose n-1}x^1 y^{n-1} + {n \\choose n}x^0 y^n,\n\nwhere each  \\tbinom nk  is a specific positive integer known as a binomial coefficient. (When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term.  Hence one often sees the right side written as \\binom{n}{0} x^n + \\ldots.) This formula is also referred to as the binomial formula or the binomial identity. Using summation notation, it can be written as\n(x+y)^n \\sum_{k\n0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k \\sum_{k\n0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}.\n\nThe final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of x and y in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.\nA simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by substituting 1 for y, so that it involves only a single variable. In this form, the formula reads\n(1+x)^n = {n \\choose 0}x^0 + {n \\choose 1}x^1 + {n \\choose 2}x^2 + \\cdots + {n \\choose {n-1}}x^{n-1} + {n \\choose n}x^n,\nor equivalently\n(1+x)^n \\sum_{k\n0}^n {n \\choose k}x^k.\n\nExamples \n\nThe most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the square of :\n\n(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\n\nThe binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the second row of Pascal's triangle.  (Note that the top \"1\" of the triangle is considered to be row 0, by convention.) The coefficients of higher powers of  correspond to lower rows of the triangle:\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 & = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^4 & = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^5 & = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^6 & = x^6 + 6x^5y + 15x^4y^2 + 20x^3y^3 + 15x^2y^4 + 6xy^5 + y^6, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^7 & = x^7 + 7x^6y + 21x^5y^2 + 35x^4y^3 + 35x^3y^4 + 21x^2y^5 + 7xy^6 + y^7.\n\\end{align}\n\nSeveral patterns can be observed from these examples. In general, for the expansion :\n# the powers of  start at  and decrease by 1 in each term until they reach 0 (with , often unwritten);\n# the powers of  start at 0 and increase by 1 until they reach ; \n# the th row of Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial when the terms are arranged in this way;\n# the number of terms in the expansion before like terms are combined is the sum of the coefficients and is equal to ; and\n# there will be  terms in the expression after combining like terms in the expansion.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+2)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2)^2 + 2^3 \\\\\n&= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8.\\end{align}\n\nFor a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form . This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:\n(x-y)^3 (x+(-y))^3 \n x^3 + 3x^2(-y) + 3x(-y)^2 + (-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 -y^3.\n\nGeometric explanation \n\nFor positive values of a and b, the binomial theorem with n  2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side  can be cut into a square of side a, a square of side b, and two rectangles with sides a and b. With n \n 3, the theorem states that a cube of side  can be cut into a cube of side a, a cube of side b, three a×a×b rectangular boxes, and three a×b×b rectangular boxes.\n\nIn calculus, this picture also gives a geometric proof of the derivative (x^n)'nx^{n-1}: if one sets ax and b\n\\Delta x, interpreting b as an infinitesimal change in a, then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube, (x+\\Delta x)^n, where the coefficient of the linear term (in \\Delta x) is nx^{n-1}, the area of the n faces, each of dimension (n-1):\n(x+\\Delta x)^n = x^n + nx^{n-1}\\Delta x + \\tbinom{n}{2}x^{n-2}(\\Delta x)^2 + \\cdots.\nSubstituting this into the definition of the derivative via a difference quotient and taking limits means that the higher order terms, (\\Delta x)^2 and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula (x^n)'=nx^{n-1}, interpreted as\n\"the infinitesimal rate of change in volume of an n-cube as side length varies is the area of n of its (n-1)-dimensional faces\".\nIf one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains Cavalieri's quadrature formula, the integral \\textstyle{\\int x^{n-1}\\,dx \\tfrac{1}{n} x^n} – see proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula for details.\n\nBinomial coefficients \n\nThe coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called binomial coefficients. These are usually written  \\tbinom nk , and pronounced “n choose k”.\n\nFormulae \n\nThe coefficient of xn−kyk is given by the formula\n\n{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}\n\nwhich is defined in terms of the factorial function n!. Equivalently, this formula can be written\n\n{n \\choose k} \\frac{n (n-1) \\cdots (n-k+1)}{k (k-1) \\cdots 1} \n \\prod_{\\ell1}^k \\frac{n-\\ell+1}{\\ell} \n \\prod_{\\ell=0}^{k-1} \\frac{n-\\ell}{k - \\ell}\n\nwith k factors in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient  \\tbinom nk  is actually an integer.\n\nCombinatorial interpretation \n\nThe binomial coefficient  \\tbinom nk  can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose k elements from an n-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write (x + y)n as a product\n(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\\cdots(x+y),\nthen, according to the distributive law, there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either x or y from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term xn, corresponding to choosing x from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form xn−2y2, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a y. Therefore, after combining like terms, the coefficient of xn−2y2 will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an n-element set.\n\nProofs \n\nCombinatorial proof \n\nExample \n\nThe coefficient of xy2 in\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 &= (x+y)(x+y)(x+y) \\\\\n&= xxx + xxy + xyx + \\underline{xyy} + yxx + \\underline{yxy} + \\underline{yyx} + yyy \\\\\n&= x^3 + 3x^2y + \\underline{3xy^2} + y^3.\n\\end{align}\n\nequals \\tbinom{3}{2}=3 because there are three x,y strings of length 3 with exactly two ys, namely,\n\nxyy, \\; yxy, \\; yyx,\n\ncorresponding to the three 2-element subsets of { 1, 2, 3 }, namely,\n\n\\{2,3\\},\\;\\{1,3\\},\\;\\{1,2\\}, \n\nwhere each subset specifies the positions of the y in a corresponding string.\n\nGeneral case \n\nExpanding (x + y)n yields the sum of the 2 n products of the form e1e2 ... e n where each e i is x or y. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals xn−kyk for some k between 0 and n. For a given k, the following are proved equal in succession:\n* the number of copies of xn − kyk in the expansion\n* the number of n-character x,y strings having y in exactly k positions\n* the number of k-element subsets of { 1, 2, ..., n}\n* {n \\choose k} (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining {n \\choose k} as \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}).\nThis proves the binomial theorem.\n\nInductive proof \n\nInduction yields another proof of the binomial theorem. When n  0, both sides equal 1, since x0 \n 1 and \\tbinom{0}{0}=1.\nNow suppose that the equality holds for a given n; we will prove it for n + 1.\nFor j, k ≥ 0, let [ƒ(x, y)] j,k denote the coefficient of xjyk in the polynomial ƒ(x, y).\nBy the inductive hypothesis, (x + y)n is a polynomial in x and y such that [(x + y)n] j,k is \\tbinom{n}{k} if j + k = n, and 0 otherwise.\nThe identity\n\n (x+y)^{n+1} = x(x+y)^n + y(x+y)^n\n\nshows that (x + y)n + 1 also is a polynomial in x and y, and\n\n [(x+y)^{n+1}]_{j,k} = [(x+y)^n]_{j-1,k} + [(x+y)^n]_{j,k-1},\n\nsince if j + k  n + 1, then (j − 1) + k \n n and j + (k − 1) = n. Now, the right hand side is\n\n \\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n+1}{k},\n\nby Pascal's identity.[http://proofs.wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial theorem] – inductive proofs  On the other hand, if j +k ≠ n + 1, then (j – 1) + k ≠ n and j +(k – 1) ≠ n, so we get 0 + 0 = 0. Thus\n\n(x+y)^{n+1} \\sum_{k\n0}^{n+1} \\tbinom{n+1}{k} x^{n+1-k} y^k,\n\nwhich is the inductive hypothesis with n + 1 substituted for n and so completes the inductive step.\n\nGeneralizations \n\nNewton's generalized binomial theorem \n\nAround 1665, Isaac Newton generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. (The same generalization also applies to complex exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an infinite series. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials.  However, for an arbitrary number r, one can define\n\n{r \\choose k}\\frac{r\\,(r-1) \\cdots (r-k+1)}{k!} \n\\frac{(r)_k}{k!},\n\nwhere (\\cdot)_k is the Pochhammer symbol, here standing for a falling factorial.  This agrees with the usual definitions when r is a nonnegative integer.  Then, if x and y are real numbers with |x| > |y|,This is to guarantee convergence. Depending on r, the series may also converge sometimes when |x| = |y|. and r is any complex number, one has\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^r & \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {r \\choose k} x^{r-k} y^k \\\\\n& = x^r + r x^{r-1} y + \\frac{r(r-1)}{2!} x^{r-2} y^2 + \\frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{3!} x^{r-3} y^3 + \\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n\nWhen r is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for k > r are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most  r + 1 nonzero terms. For other values of r, the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.\n\nFor example, with r = 1/2 gives the following series for the square root:\n\\sqrt{1+x} = \\textstyle 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x^3 - \\frac{5}{128}x^4 + \\frac{7}{256}x^5 - \\cdots\n\nTaking r=-1, the generalized binomial series gives the geometric series formula, valid for |x| :\n\n(1+x)^{-1} \\frac{1}{1+x} \n 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\cdots\n\nMore generally, with r = −s:\n\n\\frac{1}{(1-x)^s} \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose k} x^k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose s-1} x^k.\n\nSo, for instance, when s=1/2,\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x}} = \\textstyle 1 -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{8}x^2 - \\frac{5}{16}x^3 + \\frac{35}{128}x^4 - \\frac{63}{256}x^5 + \\cdots\n\nFurther generalizations \n\nThe generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where x and y are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |x| > |y| and define the powers of x + y and x using a holomorphic branch of log defined on an open disk of radius |x| centered at x.\n\nThe generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements x and y of a Banach algebra as long as xy = yx, x is invertible, and ||y/x|| (x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m)^n\n \\sum_{k_1+k_2+\\cdots +k_m \n n} {n \\choose k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m}\n x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \\cdots x_m^{k_m}. \n\nwhere the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices k1 through km such that the sum of all ki is n. (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to n). The coefficients  \\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m}  are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula\n\n {n \\choose k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m}\n = \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdots k_m!}.\n\nCombinatorially, the multinomial coefficient \\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m} counts the number of different ways to partition an n-element set into disjoint subsets of sizes k1, ..., km.\n\n Multi-binomial theorem \n\nIt is often useful when working in more dimensions, to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to\n\n (x_{1}+y_{1})^{n_{1}}\\dotsm(x_{d}+y_{d})^{n_{d}} \\sum_{k_{1}\n0}^{n_{1}}\\dotsm\\sum_{k_{d}=0}^{n_{d}} \\binom{n_{1}}{k_{1}}\\, x_{1}^{k_{1}}y_{1}^{n_{1}-k_{1}}\\;\\dotsc\\;\\binom{n_{d}}{k_{d}}\\, x_{d}^{k_{d}}y_{d}^{n_{d}-k_{d}}. \n\nThis may be written more concisely, by multi-index notation, as\n\n (x+y)^\\alpha = \\sum_{\\nu \\le \\alpha} \\binom{\\alpha}{\\nu} x^\\nu y^{\\alpha - \\nu}.\n\nApplications \n\nMultiple-angle identities \n\nFor the complex numbers the binomial theorem can be combined with De Moivre's formula to yield multiple-angle formulas for the sine and cosine. According to De Moivre's formula,\n\\cos\\left(nx\\right)+i\\sin\\left(nx\\right) = \\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^n.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(nx) and sin(nx). For example, since\n\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^2 = \\cos^2 x + 2i \\cos x \\sin x - \\sin^2 x,\nDe Moivre's formula tells us that\n\\cos(2x) \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\sin(2x) \n 2 \\cos x \\sin x,\nwhich are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since\n\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^3 = \\cos^3 x + 3i \\cos^2 x \\sin x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x - i \\sin^3 x,\nDe Moivre's formula yields\n\\cos(3x) \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin(3x) \n 3\\cos^2 x \\sin x - \\sin^3 x.\nIn general,\n\\cos(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ even}} (-1)^{k/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x\nand\n\\sin(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ odd}} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x.\n\nSeries for e \n\nThe number e is often defined by the formula\n\ne = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n.\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual infinite series for e. In particular:\n\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = 1 + {n \\choose 1}\\frac{1}{n} + {n \\choose 2}\\frac{1}{n^2} + {n \\choose 3}\\frac{1}{n^3} + \\cdots + {n \\choose n}\\frac{1}{n^n}.\n\nThe kth term of this sum is\n\n{n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}\\cdot\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots (n-k+1)}{n^k}\n\nAs n → ∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore\n\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} {n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}.\n\nThis indicates that e can be written as a series:\n\ne\\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k!}=\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots.\n\nIndeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an increasing function of n, it follows from the monotone convergence theorem for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to e.\n\nDerivative of the power function \n\nIn finding the derivative of the power function f(x) = xn for integer n using the definition of derivative, one can expand the binomial (x + h)n.\n\nNth derivative of a product \n\nTo indicate the formula for the derivative of order n of the product of two functions, the formula of the binomial theorem is used symbolically.\n\nProbability \n\nThe binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials \\{X_t\\}_{t\\in S} with probability of success p\\in [0,1] all not happening is   P\\left(\\bigcap_{t\\in S} X_t^C\\right) \n (1-p)^ \\sum_{n\n0}^",

In general, for the expansion :\n# the powers of  start at  and decrease by 1 in each term until they reach 0 (with , often unwritten);\n# the powers of  start at 0 and increase by 1 until they reach ; \n# the th row of Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial when the terms are arranged in this way;\n# the number of terms in the expansion before like terms are combined is the sum of the coefficients and is equal to ; and\n# there will be  terms in the expression after combining like terms in the expansion.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+2)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2)^2 + 2^3 \\\\\n&= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8.\\end{align}\n\nFor a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form . This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:\n(x-y)^3 (x+(-y))^3 \n x^3 + 3x^2(-y) + 3x(-y)^2 + (-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 -y^3.\n\nGeometric explanation \n\nFor positive values of a and b, the binomial theorem with n  2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side  can be cut into a square of side a, a square of side b, and two rectangles with sides a and b. With n \n 3, the theorem states that a cube of side  can be cut into a cube of side a, a cube of side b, three a×a×b rectangular boxes, and three a×b×b rectangular boxes.\n\nIn calculus, this picture also gives a geometric proof of the derivative (x^n)'nx^{n-1}: if one sets ax and b\n\\Delta x, interpreting b as an infinitesimal change in a, then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube, (x+\\Delta x)^n, where the coefficient of the linear term (in \\Delta x) is nx^{n-1}, the area of the n faces, each of dimension (n-1):\n(x+\\Delta x)^n = x^n + nx^{n-1}\\Delta x + \\tbinom{n}{2}x^{n-2}(\\Delta x)^2 + \\cdots.\nSubstituting this into the definition of the derivative via a difference quotient and taking limits means that the higher order terms, (\\Delta x)^2 and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula (x^n)'=nx^{n-1}, interpreted as\n\"the infinitesimal rate of change in volume of an n-cube as side length varies is the area of n of its (n-1)-dimensional faces\".\nIf one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains Cavalieri's quadrature formula, the integral \\textstyle{\\int x^{n-1}\\,dx \\tfrac{1}{n} x^n} – see proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula for details.\n\nBinomial coefficients \n\nThe coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called binomial coefficients. These are usually written  \\tbinom nk , and pronounced “n choose k”.\n\nFormulae \n\nThe coefficient of xn−kyk is given by the formula\n\n{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}\n\nwhich is defined in terms of the factorial function n!. Equivalently, this formula can be written\n\n{n \\choose k} \\frac{n (n-1) \\cdots (n-k+1)}{k (k-1) \\cdots 1} \n \\prod_{\\ell1}^k \\frac{n-\\ell+1}{\\ell} \n \\prod_{\\ell=0}^{k-1} \\frac{n-\\ell}{k - \\ell}\n\nwith k factors in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient  \\tbinom nk  is actually an integer.\n\nCombinatorial interpretation \n\nThe binomial coefficient  \\tbinom nk  can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose k elements from an n-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write (x + y)n as a product\n(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\\cdots(x+y),\nthen, according to the distributive law, there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either x or y from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term xn, corresponding to choosing x from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form xn−2y2, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a y. Therefore, after combining like terms, the coefficient of xn−2y2 will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an n-element set.\n\nProofs \n\nCombinatorial proof \n\nExample \n\nThe coefficient of xy2 in\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 &= (x+y)(x+y)(x+y) \\\\\n&= xxx + xxy + xyx + \\underline{xyy} + yxx + \\underline{yxy} + \\underline{yyx} + yyy \\\\\n&= x^3 + 3x^2y + \\underline{3xy^2} + y^3.\n\\end{align}\n\nequals \\tbinom{3}{2}=3 because there are three x,y strings of length 3 with exactly two ys, namely,\n\nxyy, \\; yxy, \\; yyx,\n\ncorresponding to the three 2-element subsets of { 1, 2, 3 }, namely,\n\n\\{2,3\\},\\;\\{1,3\\},\\;\\{1,2\\}, \n\nwhere each subset specifies the positions of the y in a corresponding string.\n\nGeneral case \n\nExpanding (x + y)n yields the sum of the 2 n products of the form e1e2 ... e n where each e i is x or y. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals xn−kyk for some k between 0 and n. For a given k, the following are proved equal in succession:\n* the number of copies of xn − kyk in the expansion\n* the number of n-character x,y strings having y in exactly k positions\n* the number of k-element subsets of { 1, 2, ..., n}\n* {n \\choose k} (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining {n \\choose k} as \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}).\nThis proves the binomial theorem.\n\nInductive proof \n\nInduction yields another proof of the binomial theorem. When n  0, both sides equal 1, since x0 \n 1 and \\tbinom{0}{0}=1.\nNow suppose that the equality holds for a given n; we will prove it for n + 1.\nFor j, k ≥ 0, let [ƒ(x, y)] j,k denote the coefficient of xjyk in the polynomial ƒ(x, y).\nBy the inductive hypothesis, (x + y)n is a polynomial in x and y such that [(x + y)n] j,k is \\tbinom{n}{k} if j + k = n, and 0 otherwise.\nThe identity\n\n (x+y)^{n+1} = x(x+y)^n + y(x+y)^n\n\nshows that (x + y)n + 1 also is a polynomial in x and y, and\n\n [(x+y)^{n+1}]_{j,k} = [(x+y)^n]_{j-1,k} + [(x+y)^n]_{j,k-1},\n\nsince if j + k  n + 1, then (j − 1) + k \n n and j + (k − 1) = n. Now, the right hand side is\n\n \\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n+1}{k},\n\nby Pascal's identity.[http://proofs.wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial theorem] – inductive proofs  On the other hand, if j +k ≠ n + 1, then (j – 1) + k ≠ n and j +(k – 1) ≠ n, so we get 0 + 0 = 0. Thus\n\n(x+y)^{n+1} \\sum_{k\n0}^{n+1} \\tbinom{n+1}{k} x^{n+1-k} y^k,\n\nwhich is the inductive hypothesis with n + 1 substituted for n and so completes the inductive step.\n\nGeneralizations \n\nNewton's generalized binomial theorem \n\nAround 1665, Isaac Newton generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. (The same generalization also applies to complex exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an infinite series. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials.  However, for an arbitrary number r, one can define\n\n{r \\choose k}\\frac{r\\,(r-1) \\cdots (r-k+1)}{k!} \n\\frac{(r)_k}{k!},\n\nwhere (\\cdot)_k is the Pochhammer symbol, here standing for a falling factorial.  This agrees with the usual definitions when r is a nonnegative integer.  Then, if x and y are real numbers with |x| > |y|,This is to guarantee convergence. Depending on r, the series may also converge sometimes when |x| = |y|. and r is any complex number, one has\n\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^r & \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {r \\choose k} x^{r-k} y^k \\\\\n& = x^r + r x^{r-1} y + \\frac{r(r-1)}{2!} x^{r-2} y^2 + \\frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{3!} x^{r-3} y^3 + \\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n\nWhen r is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for k > r are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most  r + 1 nonzero terms. For other values of r, the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.\n\nFor example, with r = 1/2 gives the following series for the square root:\n\\sqrt{1+x} = \\textstyle 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x^3 - \\frac{5}{128}x^4 + \\frac{7}{256}x^5 - \\cdots\n\nTaking r=-1, the generalized binomial series gives the geometric series formula, valid for |x| :\n\n(1+x)^{-1} \\frac{1}{1+x} \n 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\cdots\n\nMore generally, with r = −s:\n\n\\frac{1}{(1-x)^s} \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose k} x^k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose s-1} x^k.\n\nSo, for instance, when s=1/2,\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x}} = \\textstyle 1 -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{8}x^2 - \\frac{5}{16}x^3 + \\frac{35}{128}x^4 - \\frac{63}{256}x^5 + \\cdots\n\nFurther generalizations \n\nThe generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where x and y are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |x| > |y| and define the powers of x + y and x using a holomorphic branch of log defined on an open disk of radius |x| centered at x.\n\nThe generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements x and y of a Banach algebra as long as xy = yx, x is invertible, and ||y/x|| (x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m)^n\n \\sum_{k_1+k_2+\\cdots +k_m \n n} {n \\choose k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m}\n x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \\cdots x_m^{k_m}. \n\nwhere the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices k1 through km such that the sum of all ki is n. (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to n). The coefficients  \\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m}  are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula\n\n {n \\choose k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m}\n = \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdots k_m!}.\n\nCombinatorially, the multinomial coefficient \\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m} counts the number of different ways to partition an n-element set into disjoint subsets of sizes k1, ..., km.\n\n Multi-binomial theorem \n\nIt is often useful when working in more dimensions, to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to\n\n (x_{1}+y_{1})^{n_{1}}\\dotsm(x_{d}+y_{d})^{n_{d}} \\sum_{k_{1}\n0}^{n_{1}}\\dotsm\\sum_{k_{d}=0}^{n_{d}} \\binom{n_{1}}{k_{1}}\\, x_{1}^{k_{1}}y_{1}^{n_{1}-k_{1}}\\;\\dotsc\\;\\binom{n_{d}}{k_{d}}\\, x_{d}^{k_{d}}y_{d}^{n_{d}-k_{d}}. \n\nThis may be written more concisely, by multi-index notation, as\n\n (x+y)^\\alpha = \\sum_{\\nu \\le \\alpha} \\binom{\\alpha}{\\nu} x^\\nu y^{\\alpha - \\nu}.\n\nApplications \n\nMultiple-angle identities \n\nFor the complex numbers the binomial theorem can be combined with De Moivre's formula to yield multiple-angle formulas for the sine and cosine. According to De Moivre's formula,\n\\cos\\left(nx\\right)+i\\sin\\left(nx\\right) = \\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^n.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(nx) and sin(nx). For example, since\n\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^2 = \\cos^2 x + 2i \\cos x \\sin x - \\sin^2 x,\nDe Moivre's formula tells us that\n\\cos(2x) \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\sin(2x) \n 2 \\cos x \\sin x,\nwhich are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since\n\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^3 = \\cos^3 x + 3i \\cos^2 x \\sin x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x - i \\sin^3 x,\nDe Moivre's formula yields\n\\cos(3x) \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin(3x) \n 3\\cos^2 x \\sin x - \\sin^3 x.\nIn general,\n\\cos(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ even}} (-1)^{k/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x\nand\n\\sin(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ odd}} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x.\n\nSeries for e \n\nThe number e is often defined by the formula\n\ne = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n.\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual infinite series for e. In particular:\n\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = 1 + {n \\choose 1}\\frac{1}{n} + {n \\choose 2}\\frac{1}{n^2} + {n \\choose 3}\\frac{1}{n^3} + \\cdots + {n \\choose n}\\frac{1}{n^n}.\n\nThe kth term of this sum is\n\n{n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}\\cdot\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots (n-k+1)}{n^k}\n\nAs n → ∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore\n\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} {n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}.\n\nThis indicates that e can be written as a series:\n\ne\\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k!}=\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots.\n\nIndeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an increasing function of n, it follows from the monotone convergence theorem for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to e.\n\nDerivative of the power function \n\nIn finding the derivative of the power function f(x) = xn for integer n using the definition of derivative, one can expand the binomial (x + h)n.\n\nNth derivative of a product \n\nTo indicate the formula for the derivative of order n of the product of two functions, the formula of the binomial theorem is used symbolically.\n\nProbability \n\nThe binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials \\{X_t\\}_{t\\in S} with probability of success p\\in [0,1] all not happening is   P\\left(\\bigcap_{t\\in S} X_t^C\\right) \n (1-p)^ \\sum_{n\n0}^.
