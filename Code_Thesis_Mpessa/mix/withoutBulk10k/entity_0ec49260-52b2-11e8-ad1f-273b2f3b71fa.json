  "textBody" : "“Heart of Oak” is the official march of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. It is also the official march of several Commonwealth navies including the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy. Royal Canadian Sea Cadets march to \"Heart of Oak\" during their parades. (It was also the official march of the Royal Australian Navy, but has now been replaced by the new march, \"Royal Australian Navy.\")\n\nThe music of “Heart of Oak” was composed by William Boyce, and the words were written by the 18th-century English actor David Garrick. \"Heart of Oak\" was originally written as part of an opera. It was first played publicly on New Year's Eve of 1760, sung by Samuel Thomas Champnes, one of Handel's soloists, as part of Garrick's pantomime Harlequin's Invasion, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nThe \"wonderful year\" referenced in the first verse was 1759, an “Annus mirabilis” during which British forces were victorious in several significant battles: the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, the Battle of Lagos on 19 August 1759, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (outside Quebec City) on 13 September 1759, and the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. (This battle foiled a French invasion project planned by the Duc de Choiseul to defeat Britain during the Seven Years' War, hence the reference in the song to 'flat-bottom' invasion barges.) These victories were followed a few months later by the Battle of Wandiwash in India on 22 January 1760. Britain's continued success in the war boosted the song's popularity.\n\nThe oak in the song's title refers to the wood from which British warships were generally made during the age of sail. The \"Heart of oak\" is the strongest central wood of the tree. The phrase \"hearts of oak\" appears in English translations of the Aeneid.\n\nThe reference to \"freemen not slaves\" echoes the refrain (\"Britons never will be slaves!\") of Rule, Britannia!, written and composed two decades earlier.\n\nLyrics\n\nCome, cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,\nTo add something more to this wonderful year;\nTo honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,\nFor who are so free as the sons of the waves?\n\nChorus:\nHeart of Oak are our ships, \nJolly Tars are our men, \nWe always are ready: Steady, boys, Steady! \nWe'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.\n\nWe ne'er see our foes but we wish them to stay,\nThey never see us but they wish us away;\nIf they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,\nFor if they won't fight us, what can we do more?\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThey say they'll invade us these terrible foe,\nThey frighten our women, our children, our beaus,\nBut if should their flat-bottoms, in darkness set oar,\nStill Britons they'll find to receive them on shore.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWe still make them fear and we still make them flee,\nAnd drub them ashore as we drub them at sea,\nThen cheer up me lads with one heart let us sing,\nOur soldiers and sailors, our statesmen and king.\n\n(Chorus X2)\n\nAlternative first verse:\nCome, cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,\nWith heads carried high, we will banish all fear;\nTo honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,\nFor who are so free as the sons of the waves?\n\nAlternative last verse:\nBritannia triumphant her ships rule the seas,\nHer watch word is 'Justice' her password is 'Free',\nSo come cheer up my lads, with one heart let us sing,\nOur soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen, our king[queen].\n\nNew lyrics\n\nA new version was presented on 16 April 1809 and published in the Spirit of the public Journals, vol.
