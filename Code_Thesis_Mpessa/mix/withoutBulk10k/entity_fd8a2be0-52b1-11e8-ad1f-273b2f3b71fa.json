He contributed to both of the first science fiction fanzines, The Time Traveller, and the Science Fiction Magazine, published and edited by Shuster and Siegel of Superman fame, in 1932, and by 1933 had 127 correspondents around the world. His name was used for the character of the reporter in the original Superman story \"The Reign of the Superman\" in issue 3 of Science Fiction magazine. He was one of the early members of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society and remained active in it for many decades.\n\nHe attended the 1st World Science Fiction Convention in 1939, where he wore the first \"futuristicostume\" (designed and created by Myrtle R. Douglas) and sparked fan costuming, the latest incarnation of which is cosplay.  He attended every Worldcon but two thereafter during his lifetime. Ackerman invited Ray Bradbury to attend the Los Angeles Chapter of the Science Fiction League, then meeting weekly at Clifton's Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles.  The club changed its name to the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society during the period it was meeting at the restaurant.  (There never was a \"Clifton’s Cafeteria Science Fiction Club.\")  Among the writers frequenting the club were Robert A. Heinlein, Emil Petaja, Fredric Brown, Henry Kuttner, Leigh Brackett and Jack Williamson. Bradbury often attended meetings with his friend Ray Harryhausen; the two Rays had been introduced to each other by Ackerman.  With $90 from Ackerman, Bradbury launched a fanzine, Futuria Fantasia, in 1939.\n\nAckerman was an early member of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Science Fiction League and became so active in and important to the club that in essence he ran it, including after the name change the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, a prominent regional organization, as well as the National Fantasy Fan Federation (N3F).\n\nAckerman amassed an extremely large and complete collection of science fiction, fantasy and horror film memorabilia, which, until 2002, he maintained in a remarkable 18-room home and museum known as the \"Son of Ackermansion.\"  (The original Ackermansion where he lived from the early 1950s until the mid-1970s was at 915 S. Sherbourne Drive in Los Angeles; the site is now an apartment building.)  This second house, in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, contained some 300,000 books and pieces of movie and science-fiction memorabilia. From 1951 to 2002, Ackerman entertained some 50,000 fans at open houses - including, on one such evening, a group of 186 fans and professionals, including astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Ackerman was a board member of the Seattle Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, where many items of his collection are now displayed.\n\nHe knew most of the writers of science fiction in the first half of the twentieth century. As a literary agent, he represented some 200 writers, and he served as agent of record for many long-lost authors, thereby allowing their work to be reprinted in anthologies. He was Ed Wood's \"illiterary\" agent.[http://www.dragoncon.org/people/ackermf.html]   Ackerman was credited with nurturing and even inspiring the careers of several early contemporaries Retrieved August 18, 2006. like Ray Bradbury, Ray Harryhausen, Charles Beaumont, Marion Zimmer Bradley and L. Ron Hubbard. He kept all of the stories submitted to his magazine, even the ones he rejected; Stephen King has stated that Ackerman showed up to a King book signing with a copy of a story King had submitted for publication when he was 11.King, Stephen. On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. Scribner 2000  pg. 35\n\nAckerman had 50 stories published, including collaborations with A. E. van Vogt, Francis Flagg, Robert A. W. Lowndes, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Donald Wollheim and Catherine Moore and the world's shortest – one letter of the alphabet. His stories have been translated into six languages. Ackerman named the sexy comic-book character Vampirella and wrote the origin story for the comic.\n\nHe also authored several lesbian stories under the name \"Laurajean Ermayne\" for Vice Versa and provided publishing assistance in the early days of the Daughters of Bilitis. He was dubbed an \"honorary lesbian\" at a DOB party.Matthesen, Elise. \"Vampires and Aliens.\" Lavender Lifestyles, November 24, 1995. [http://www.tc.umn.edu/~d-lena/Vampires%20and%20Aliens.html Online copy]\n\nThrough his magazine, Famous Monsters of Filmland (1958–1983), Ackerman introduced the history of the science fiction, fantasy and horror film genres to a generation of young readers. At a time when most movie-related publications glorified the stars in front of the camera, \"Uncle Forry\", as he was referred to by many of his fans, promoted the behind-the-scenes artists involved in the magic of movies. In this way, Ackerman provided inspiration to many who would later become successful artists, including Joe Dante, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, Stephen King, Donald F. Glut, Penn & Teller, Billy Bob Thornton, Gene Simmons (of the band Kiss), Rick Baker, George Lucas, Danny Elfman, Frank Darabont, John Landis and countless other writers, directors, artists and craftsmen.\n\nHe also contributed to film magazines from all around the world, including the Spanish-language La Cosa: Cine Fantástico magazine from Argentina, where he had a monthly column for over four years.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ackerman organized the publication of an English translation in the U.S. of the German science fiction series Perry Rhodan, the longest science fiction series in history. These were published by Ace Books from 1969 through 1977.  Ackerman's German-speaking wife Wendayne (\"Wendy\") did most of the translation. The American books were issued with varying frequency from one to as many as four per month. Ackerman also used the paperback series to promote science fiction short stories, including his own on occasion.  These \"magabooks\" or \"bookazines\" also included a film review section, known as \"Scientifilm World\", and letters from readers. The American series came to an end when the management of Ace changed and the new management decided that the series was too juvenile for their taste. The last Ace issue was #118, which corresponded to German issue #126 as some of the Ace editions contained two of the German issues, and three of the German issues had been skipped. Ackerman later published translations of German issues #127 through #145 on his own under the Master Publications imprint. (The original German series continues today and passed issue #2800 in 2015.)\n\nAppearances in film, television and music\n\nA lifelong fan of science fiction \"B-movies\", Ackerman appeared in more than 210 films, including parts in many monster movies and science fiction films (Dracula vs. Frankenstein, The Howling, The Aftermath, Scalps, Return of the Living Dead Part II, Innocent Blood), more traditional \"imagi-movies\" (The Time Travelers, Future War), spoofs and comedies (Amazon Women on the Moon, The Wizard of Speed and Time, Curse of the Queerwolf, Transylvania Twist, Hard to Die, Nudist Colony of the Dead, Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold) and at least one major music video (Michael Jackson's Thriller). His Bacon number is 2.\n\nIn 1961, Ackerman narrated the record Music for Robots created by Frank Allison Coe. The cover featured Ackerman's face superimposed on the robot from the movie Tobor the Great. The record was reissued on CD in 2005.\n\nAckerman (as himself) appears as a character in The Vampire Affair by David McDaniel (a novel in the Man from U.N.C.L.E. series), and Philip José Farmer's novel The Image Of The Beast, first published as the short story \"Blown\" in Screw Magazine by Al Goldstein.\n\nA character based on Ackerman and an analogue to the Ackermansion appears in the collaborative novel 'Fallen Angels' written jointly by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Michael F. Flynn.\n\n\"Eccar the Man\" is mentioned in The Flying Sorcerers, a novel jointly written by Niven and David Gerrold, which features a number of characters based on notables from the science fiction community.\n\nHe appeared on the intro track of Ohio horror punk music group Manimals' 1999 album Horrorcore.\n\nIn 2001 Ackerman played the part of an old wax museum caretaker in the camp comedy film The Double-D Avenger directed by William Winckler and starring Russ Meyer stars Kitten Natividad, Haji, and Raven De La Croix. Ackerman played a crazy old man who was in love with Kitten Natividad's character, The Double-D Avenger, and he also talked to the Frankenstein figure and other wax monsters in the museum's chamber of horrors.\n\nAckerman appeared extensively on-screen discussing his life and the history of science fiction fandom in the 2006 documentary film Finding the Future.[http://www.findingthefuture.com]   \n\nIn 2007, Roadhouse Films of Canada released a documentary, Famous Monster: Forrest J Ackerman. The documentary, available on DVD only in the UK, airs regularly on the BRAVO channel.\n\nIn the 2012 action film Premium Rush, the character of the corrupt policeman Bobby Monday (played by Michael Shannon) repeatedly uses the alias \"Forrest J Ackerman\".\n\nIn 2013 the science fiction author Jason V Brock released a feature-length documentary about Ackerman called The Ackermonster Chronicles!.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAckerman had one sibling, a younger brother, Alden Lorraine Ackerman, who was killed at the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAckerman was married to a German-born teacher and translator, Mathilda Wahrman (1912–1990), whom he met in the early 1950s while she was working in a book store he happened to visit.  He eventually dubbed her \"Wendayne\" or, less formally, \"Wendy\", by which name she became most generally known within SF and film fandoms, after the character in Peter Pan, his favorite fantasy.  Although they went through a period of separation during the late 1950s and early 1960s, they remained officially married until her death: she suffered serious internal injuries when she was violently mugged while visiting Italy in 1990 and irreparable damage to her kidneys led to her death.  They had no children of their own by choice, but Wahrman did have a son by an earlier marriage, Michael Porges, who did not get along with Ackerman and would not live in Ackerman's home.\n\nAckerman was fluent in the international language Esperanto, and claimed to have walked down Hollywood Boulevard arm-in-arm with Leo G. Carroll singing La Espero, the hymn of Esperanto.\n\nAckerman was an atheist, but did not emphasize that fact in his public life and welcomed people of all faiths as well as no faith into his home and personal circle equally.http://www.unknowncountry.com/insight/ackerman-enigma-strange-case-forrest-j-ackerman-paul-davids\nHis first public stance on any political issue was in opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 2003, Ackerman said, \"I aim at hitting 100 and becoming the George Burns of science fiction\". His health, however, had been failing. He was susceptible to infection in his later life and, after one final trip to the hospital in October 2008, informed his best friend and caregiver Joe Moe that he did not want to go on. Honoring his wishes, his friends brought him home to hospice care. However, it turned out that in order to get Ackerman home, the hospital had cured his infection with antibiotics. So Ackerman went on for a few more weeks holding what he delighted in calling \"a living funeral\". In his final days he saw everyone he wanted to say good-bye to. Fans were encouraged to send messages of farewell by mail.\n\nWhile there were several premature reports of his death in the month prior,These reports originated from a news article on the British Fantasy Society website; a correction was subsequently made. [http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/news British Fantasy Society website] Ackerman died a minute before midnight on December 4, 2008, at the age of 92.\"Forry Ackerman: A Loyal and Staunch Friend\".

On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. Scribner 2000  pg. 35\n\nAckerman had 50 stories published, including collaborations with A. E. van Vogt, Francis Flagg, Robert A. W. Lowndes, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Donald Wollheim and Catherine Moore and the world's shortest – one letter of the alphabet. His stories have been translated into six languages. Ackerman named the sexy comic-book character Vampirella and wrote the origin story for the comic.\n\nHe also authored several lesbian stories under the name \"Laurajean Ermayne\" for Vice Versa and provided publishing assistance in the early days of the Daughters of Bilitis. He was dubbed an \"honorary lesbian\" at a DOB party.Matthesen, Elise. \"Vampires and Aliens.\" Lavender Lifestyles, November 24, 1995. [http://www.tc.umn.edu/~d-lena/Vampires%20and%20Aliens.html Online copy]\n\nThrough his magazine, Famous Monsters of Filmland (1958–1983), Ackerman introduced the history of the science fiction, fantasy and horror film genres to a generation of young readers. At a time when most movie-related publications glorified the stars in front of the camera, \"Uncle Forry\", as he was referred to by many of his fans, promoted the behind-the-scenes artists involved in the magic of movies. In this way, Ackerman provided inspiration to many who would later become successful artists, including Joe Dante, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, Stephen King, Donald F. Glut, Penn & Teller, Billy Bob Thornton, Gene Simmons (of the band Kiss), Rick Baker, George Lucas, Danny Elfman, Frank Darabont, John Landis and countless other writers, directors, artists and craftsmen.\n\nHe also contributed to film magazines from all around the world, including the Spanish-language La Cosa: Cine Fantástico magazine from Argentina, where he had a monthly column for over four years.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ackerman organized the publication of an English translation in the U.S. of the German science fiction series Perry Rhodan, the longest science fiction series in history. These were published by Ace Books from 1969 through 1977.  Ackerman's German-speaking wife Wendayne (\"Wendy\") did most of the translation. The American books were issued with varying frequency from one to as many as four per month. Ackerman also used the paperback series to promote science fiction short stories, including his own on occasion.  These \"magabooks\" or \"bookazines\" also included a film review section, known as \"Scientifilm World\", and letters from readers. The American series came to an end when the management of Ace changed and the new management decided that the series was too juvenile for their taste. The last Ace issue was #118, which corresponded to German issue #126 as some of the Ace editions contained two of the German issues, and three of the German issues had been skipped. Ackerman later published translations of German issues #127 through #145 on his own under the Master Publications imprint. (The original German series continues today and passed issue #2800 in 2015.)\n\nAppearances in film, television and music\n\nA lifelong fan of science fiction \"B-movies\", Ackerman appeared in more than 210 films, including parts in many monster movies and science fiction films (Dracula vs. Frankenstein, The Howling, The Aftermath, Scalps, Return of the Living Dead Part II, Innocent Blood), more traditional \"imagi-movies\" (The Time Travelers, Future War), spoofs and comedies (Amazon Women on the Moon, The Wizard of Speed and Time, Curse of the Queerwolf, Transylvania Twist, Hard to Die, Nudist Colony of the Dead, Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold) and at least one major music video (Michael Jackson's Thriller). His Bacon number is 2.\n\nIn 1961, Ackerman narrated the record Music for Robots created by Frank Allison Coe. The cover featured Ackerman's face superimposed on the robot from the movie Tobor the Great. The record was reissued on CD in 2005.\n\nAckerman (as himself) appears as a character in The Vampire Affair by David McDaniel (a novel in the Man from U.N.C.L.E. series), and Philip José Farmer's novel The Image Of The Beast, first published as the short story \"Blown\" in Screw Magazine by Al Goldstein.\n\nA character based on Ackerman and an analogue to the Ackermansion appears in the collaborative novel 'Fallen Angels' written jointly by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Michael F. Flynn.\n\n\"Eccar the Man\" is mentioned in The Flying Sorcerers, a novel jointly written by Niven and David Gerrold, which features a number of characters based on notables from the science fiction community.\n\nHe appeared on the intro track of Ohio horror punk music group Manimals' 1999 album Horrorcore.\n\nIn 2001 Ackerman played the part of an old wax museum caretaker in the camp comedy film The Double-D Avenger directed by William Winckler and starring Russ Meyer stars Kitten Natividad, Haji, and Raven De La Croix. Ackerman played a crazy old man who was in love with Kitten Natividad's character, The Double-D Avenger, and he also talked to the Frankenstein figure and other wax monsters in the museum's chamber of horrors.\n\nAckerman appeared extensively on-screen discussing his life and the history of science fiction fandom in the 2006 documentary film Finding the Future.[http://www.findingthefuture.com]   \n\nIn 2007, Roadhouse Films of Canada released a documentary, Famous Monster: Forrest J Ackerman. The documentary, available on DVD only in the UK, airs regularly on the BRAVO channel.\n\nIn the 2012 action film Premium Rush, the character of the corrupt policeman Bobby Monday (played by Michael Shannon) repeatedly uses the alias \"Forrest J Ackerman\".\n\nIn 2013 the science fiction author Jason V Brock released a feature-length documentary about Ackerman called The Ackermonster Chronicles!.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAckerman had one sibling, a younger brother, Alden Lorraine Ackerman, who was killed at the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAckerman was married to a German-born teacher and translator, Mathilda Wahrman (1912–1990), whom he met in the early 1950s while she was working in a book store he happened to visit.  He eventually dubbed her \"Wendayne\" or, less formally, \"Wendy\", by which name she became most generally known within SF and film fandoms, after the character in Peter Pan, his favorite fantasy.  Although they went through a period of separation during the late 1950s and early 1960s, they remained officially married until her death: she suffered serious internal injuries when she was violently mugged while visiting Italy in 1990 and irreparable damage to her kidneys led to her death.  They had no children of their own by choice, but Wahrman did have a son by an earlier marriage, Michael Porges, who did not get along with Ackerman and would not live in Ackerman's home.\n\nAckerman was fluent in the international language Esperanto, and claimed to have walked down Hollywood Boulevard arm-in-arm with Leo G. Carroll singing La Espero, the hymn of Esperanto.\n\nAckerman was an atheist, but did not emphasize that fact in his public life and welcomed people of all faiths as well as no faith into his home and personal circle equally.http://www.unknowncountry.com/insight/ackerman-enigma-strange-case-forrest-j-ackerman-paul-davids\nHis first public stance on any political issue was in opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 2003, Ackerman said, \"I aim at hitting 100 and becoming the George Burns of science fiction\". His health, however, had been failing. He was susceptible to infection in his later life and, after one final trip to the hospital in October 2008, informed his best friend and caregiver Joe Moe that he did not want to go on. Honoring his wishes, his friends brought him home to hospice care. However, it turned out that in order to get Ackerman home, the hospital had cured his infection with antibiotics. So Ackerman went on for a few more weeks holding what he delighted in calling \"a living funeral\". In his final days he saw everyone he wanted to say good-bye to. Fans were encouraged to send messages of farewell by mail.\n\nWhile there were several premature reports of his death in the month prior,These reports originated from a news article on the British Fantasy Society website; a correction was subsequently made. [http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/news British Fantasy Society website] Ackerman died a minute before midnight on December 4, 2008, at the age of 92.\"Forry Ackerman: A Loyal and Staunch Friend\".
