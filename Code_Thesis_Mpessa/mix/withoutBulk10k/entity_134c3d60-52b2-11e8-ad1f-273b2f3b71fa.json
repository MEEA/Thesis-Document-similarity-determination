She further stated that \"Part of Hefner's business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable.\"\n\nWriting for The Independent, in the same vein, English writer Julie Bindel stated that Hefner \"caused immeasurable damage by turning porn – and therefore the buying and selling of women’s bodies – into a legitimate business.\"\nWriting for Christianity Today, Missiologist Ed Stetzer wrote that during his lifetime, when Christie Hefner visited the Playboy Mansion, he would have the residence systematically cleaned in order \"to keep the realities from his own daughter\". Stezer further lamented the consequences of Hefner's role as a \"general\" of the sexual revolution:\n\nHefner's former girlfriend, Holly Madison, said that while she lived in the Playboy Mansion, Hefner \"would encourage competition—and body image issues—between his multiple live-in girlfriends. His legacy is full of evidence of the exploitation of women for professional gain.\"\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nOn October 3, 2017, it was announced that Academy Award winner actor Jared Leto would play Hugh Hefner in a biopic directed by Brett Ratner with the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson but the biopic was put indefinitely on hold and was confirmed that Leto would not portray the Playboy founder following an emergence of sexual harassment allegations against Ratner on November 2, 2017.",

In 1971, he acknowledged that he experimented in bisexuality. Also in 1971, Hefner established a second residence in Los Angeles with the acquisition of Playboy Mansion West and, in 1975, moved there permanently from Chicago.\n\nIn 1985, Hefner had a minor stroke at age 59. After re-evaluating his lifestyle, he made several changes. The wild, all-night parties were toned down significantly and in 1988, daughter Christie took over the operation of the Playboy empire. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad; they were 36 years apart in age. The couple had two sons: Marston Glenn (born 1990) and Cooper Hefner (born 1991).[http://www.tv.com/cooper-hefner/person/545473/summary.html Cooper Hefner]. TV.com The E!

Madison, Wilkinson and Marquardt appeared on The Girls Next Door depicting their lives at the Playboy Mansion.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218213431/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-girls-next-door/a-new-boy-for-former-girl-next-26275.aspx A New Boy for Former 'Girl Next Door']. BuddyTV.com. February 10, 2009 In October 2008, all three girls decided to leave the mansion. After an 11-year separation, Hefner filed for divorce from Conrad, citing irreconcilable differences. Hefner has stated that he only remained nominally married to her for the sake of his children, and his youngest child had just turned 18.\n\nIn January 2009, Hefner began a relationship with Crystal Harris; she joined the Shannon Twins after his previous \"number one girlfriend\", Holly Madison, had ended their seven-year relationship. On December 24, 2010, he became engaged to Harris, to become his third wife. Harris broke off their engagement on June 14, 2011, five days before their planned wedding. In anticipation of the wedding, the July issue of Playboy, which reached store shelves and customer's homes within days of the wedding date, featured Harris on the cover and in a photo spread as well. The headline on the cover read \"Introducing America's Princess, Mrs. Crystal Hefner\". Hefner and Harris subsequently reconciled and married on December 31, 2012.\n\nHefner's brother Keith died at the age of 87 on April 8, 2016, one day before Hefner's 90th birthday.\n\nPlayboy Mansion\n\nIn January 2016, the Playboy Mansion was put on the market for $200 million, on condition that Hugh Hefner would continue to work and live in the mansion. Later that year it was sold to Daren Metropoulos, a principal at private equity firm Metropoulos & Company, for $100 million. Metropoulos planned to reconnect the Playboy Mansion property with a neighboring estate that he purchased in 2009, combining the two for a 7.3 acre (3-hectare) compound as his own private residence.\n\nIn May 2017, Eugena Washington was the last Playmate of the Year to be announced by Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.\n\nPolitics and philanthropy\n\nThe Hugh M.

NewsMeat.com. In 2011, he referred to himself as an independent due to disillusionment with both the Democratic and Republican parties. However, in 2012, he supported Barack Obama's reelection campaign.\n\nIn 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the Hollywood Sign. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.\n\nHefner donated $100,000 to the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts to create a course called \"Censorship in Cinema\", and $2 million to endow a chair for the study of American film.[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-11-15-hefner-USC_N.htm Hefner Gives $2M to USC Film School] Associated Press, November 16, 2007.\n\nBoth through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributed to charities outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue as well as Generation Rescue, a controversial anti-vaccinationist campaign organization supported by Jenny McCarthy.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, Children of the Night founder and president Dr. Lois Lee presented Hefner with the organization's first-ever Founder's Hero of the Heart Award in appreciation for his unwavering dedication, commitment and generosity. On April 26, 2010, Hefner donated the last $900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to stop the development of the famed vista of the Hollywood Sign. Sylvilagus palustris hefneri, an endangered subspecies of marsh rabbit, is named after him in honor of financial support that he provided.\n\nHefner supported legalizing same-sex marriage, and he stated that a fight for gay marriage was \"a fight for all our rights. Without it, we will turn back the sexual revolution and return to an earlier, puritanical time.\"\n\nDeath\n\nHefner died at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, on September 27, 2017, at the age of 91. The causes were cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, sepsis and an E. coli infection.\n\nHe is interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles, in the $75,000 crypt beside Marilyn Monroe. \"Spending eternity next to Marilyn is an opportunity too sweet to pass up,\" Hefner had told the Los Angeles Times in 2009.\n\nCriticism\n\nIn The Guardian, journalist Suzanne Moore wrote that Hefner threatened to file a lawsuit against her for calling him a \"pimp\". Defending her position, Moore argued that \"he was a man who bought and sold women to other men\". She further stated that \"Part of Hefner's business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable.\"\n\nWriting for The Independent, in the same vein, English writer Julie Bindel stated that Hefner \"caused immeasurable damage by turning porn – and therefore the buying and selling of women’s bodies – into a legitimate business.\"\nWriting for Christianity Today, Missiologist Ed Stetzer wrote that during his lifetime, when Christie Hefner visited the Playboy Mansion, he would have the residence systematically cleaned in order \"to keep the realities from his own daughter\". Stezer further lamented the consequences of Hefner's role as a \"general\" of the sexual revolution:\n\nHefner's former girlfriend, Holly Madison, said that while she lived in the Playboy Mansion, Hefner \"would encourage competition—and body image issues—between his multiple live-in girlfriends. His legacy is full of evidence of the exploitation of women for professional gain.\"\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nOn October 3, 2017, it was announced that Academy Award winner actor Jared Leto would play Hugh Hefner in a biopic directed by Brett Ratner with the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson but the biopic was put indefinitely on hold and was confirmed that Leto would not portray the Playboy founder following an emergence of sexual harassment allegations against Ratner on November 2, 2017.
