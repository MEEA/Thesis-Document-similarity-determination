  "textBody" : "A goitre or goiter is a swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland. The term is also used to describe an enlarged thyroid. A goitre is associated with a thyroid that is not functioning properly.\n\nWorldwide, over 90% of goitre cases are caused by iodine deficiency.R. Hörmann: Schilddrüsenkrankheiten. ABW-Wissenschaftsverlag, 4. Auflage 2005, Seite 15–37.  The term is from the Latin gutteria. Most goitres are of a benign nature.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nA goitre, associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, may be present with symptoms of the underlying disorder. For hyperthyroidism, the most common symptoms are associated with adrenergic stimulation: tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, tremor, increased blood pressure and heat intolerance. Clinical manifestations are often related to hypermetabolism, (increased metabolism), excessive thyroid hormone, an increase in oxygen consumption, metabolic changes in protein metabolism, immunologic stimulation of diffuse goitre, and ocular changes (exophthalmos).Porth, C. M., Gaspard, K. J., & Noble, K. A. (2011). Essentials of pathophysiology: Concepts of altered health states (3rd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Hypothyroid individuals may have weight gain despite poor appetite, cold intolerance, constipation and lethargy. However, these symptoms are often non-specific and make diagnosis difficult.\n\nMorphology\n\nRegarding morphology, goitres may be classified either as the growth pattern or as the size of the growth :\n\n;Growth pattern:\n*Uninodular goitre: one thyroid nodule; can be either an inactive or a toxic nodule. \n*Multinodular goitre: multiple nodules;  can likewise be inactive or toxic, the latter is called toxic multinodular goitre and associated with hyperthyroidism; thyroid cancer is identified in 13.7% of the patients operated for multinodular goitre. These nodules grow up at varying rates and secrete thyroid hormone autonomously, thereby suppressing TSH-dependent growth and function in the rest of gland.\n*Diffuse goitre: the whole thyroid appearing to be enlarged due to hyperplasia.\n\n;Size:\n* Class I (palpation goitre): in normal posture of the head, it cannot be seen; it is only found by palpation.\n* Class II: the goitre is palpable and can be easily seen.\n* Class III: the goitre is very large and is retrosternal; pressure results in compression marks.\n\nFile:Struma 001.jpg|Goitre (Class II)\nFile:Struma 004.jpg|Goitre with autonomous adenoma\nFile:Kone med stor struma.jpg|Goitre Class III\nFile:Goiter Kocher 1874.jpg|Goitre Class III\n\nCauses\n\nWorldwide, the most common cause for goitre is iodine deficiency, usually seen in countries that do not use iodized salt. Selenium deficiency is also considered a contributing factor. In countries that use iodized salt, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause.  Goitre can also result from cyanide poisoning; this is particularly common in tropical countries where people eat the cyanide-rich cassava root as the staple food.\n\n* Sarcoidosis\n* Amyloidosis\n* Hydatidiform mole\n* Cysts\n* Acromegaly\n* Pendred syndrome\n\nTreatment\n\nGoitre is treated according to the cause. If the thyroid gland is producing too much T3 and T4, radioactive iodine is given to the patient to shrink the gland. If goitre is caused by iodine deficiency, small doses of iodide in the form of Lugol's Iodine or KI solution are given. If the goitre is associated with an underactive thyroid, thyroid supplements are used as treatment. In extreme cases, a partial or complete thyroidectomy is required.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nGoitre is more common among women, but this includes the many types of goitre caused by autoimmune problems, and not only those caused by simple lack of iodine.\n\nHistory\n\nChinese physicians of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) were the first to successfully treat patients with goitre by using the iodine-rich thyroid gland of animals such as sheep and pigs—in raw, pill, or powdered form.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a foreword by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. . Pages 133–134. This was outlined in Zhen Quan's (d. 643 AD) book, as well as several others.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a foreword by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. . Page 134. One Chinese book, The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman, asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goitre patients by the 1st century BC, but this book was written much later.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a foreword by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. . Pages 134–135\n\nIn the 12th century, Zayn al-Din al-Jurjani, a Persian physician, provided the first description of Graves' disease after noting the association of goitre and a displacement of the eye known as exophthalmos in his Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm, the major medical dictionary of its time. – the history and naming of the disease Al-Jurjani also established an association between goitre and palpitation. The disease was later named after Irish doctor Robert James Graves, who described a case of goitre with exophthalmos in 1835. The German Karl Adolph von Basedow also independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in 1840, while earlier reports of the disease were also published by the Italians Giuseppe Flajani and Antonio Giuseppe Testa, in 1802 and 1810 respectively, and by the English physician Caleb Hillier Parry (a friend of Edward Jenner) in the late 18th century.\n\nParacelsus (1493–1541) was the first person to propose a relationship between goitre and minerals (particularly lead) in drinking water.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/442424/Paracelsus/5505/Assessment \"Paracelsus\"] Britannica Iodine was later discovered by Bernard Courtois in 1811 from seaweed ash.\n\nGoitre was previously common in many areas that were deficient in iodine in the soil. For example, in the English Midlands, the condition was known as Derbyshire Neck. In the United States, goitre was found in the Great Lakes, Midwest, and Intermountain regions. The condition now is practically absent in affluent nations, where table salt is supplemented with iodine. However, it is still prevalent in India, China,[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html \"In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt\"], article by Donald G. McNeil, Jr., December 16, 2006, New York Times Central Asia, and Central Africa.\n\nGoitre had been prevalent in the alpine countries for a long time. Switzerland reduced the condition by introducing iodised salt in 1922. The Bavarian tracht in  the Miesbach and Salzburg regions, which appeared in the 19th century, includes a choker, dubbed Kropfband (struma band) which was used to hide either the goitre or the remnants of goitre surgery.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nIn the 1920s wearing bottles of iodine around the neck was believed to prevent goitre.\n\nNotable cases\n\n* Former US President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara Bush were both diagnosed with Graves' disease and goitres, within two years of each other. The disease caused hyperthyroidism and cardiac dysrhythmia.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res9D0CE6DB1439F937A2575AC0A967958260 Lawrence K. Altman, M.D. \"Doctors Say Bush Is in Good Health\"]. The New York Times. September 14, 1991.
