The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions, written in Aramaic while the surrounding text is in Hebrew (1:2-4, 4:8-16, 4:17-22, 5:7-17, 6:3-5, 6:6-12, 7:12-26) \n\n;Chapters 1–6 (documents included in the text in italics)\n*1. Decree of Cyrus, first version: Cyrus, inspired by God, returns the Temple vessels to Sheshbazzar, \"prince of Judah\", and directs the Israelites to return to Jerusalem with him and rebuild the Temple.\n*2. 42,360 exiles, with men servants, women servants and \"singing men and women\", return from Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Jeshua the High Priest.\n*3. Jeshua the High Priest and Zerubbabel build the altar and celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. In the second year the foundations of the Temple are laid and the dedication takes place with great rejoicing.\n*4. Letter of the Samaritans to Artaxerxes, and reply of Artaxerxes: The \"enemies of Judah and Benjamin\" offer to help with the rebuilding, but are rebuffed; they then work to frustrate the builders \"down to the reign of Darius.\" The officials of Samaria write to king Artaxerxes warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt, and the king orders the work to stop. \"Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.\"\n*5. Tattenai's letter to Darius: Through the exhortations of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, Zerubbabel and Joshua recommence the building of the Temple. Tattenai, satrap over both Judah and Samaria, writes to Darius warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt and advising that the archives be searched to discover the decree of Cyrus.\n*6. Decree of Cyrus, second version, and decree of Darius: Darius finds the decree, directs Tattenai not to disturb the Jews in their work, and exempts them from tribute and supplies everything necessary for the offerings. The Temple is finished in the month of Adar in the sixth year of Darius, and the Israelites assemble to celebrate its completion.\n\n;Chapters 7–10\n*7. Letter of Artaxerxes to Ezra (Artaxerxes' rescript): King Artaxerxes is moved by God to commission Ezra \"to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God\" and to \"appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God.\" Artaxerxes gives Ezra much gold and directs all Persian officials to aid him.\n*8. Ezra gathers a large body of returnees and much gold and silver and precious vessels for the Temple and camps by a canal outside Babylon. There he discovers he has no Levites, and so sends messengers to gather some. The exiles then return to Jerusalem, where they distribute the gold and silver and offer sacrifices to God.\n*9. Ezra is informed that some of the Jews already in Jerusalem have married non-Jewish women. Ezra is appalled at this proof of sin, and prays to God: \"O God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.\"\n*10. Despite the opposition of some of their number, the Israelites assemble and send away their foreign wives and children.\n\nHistorical background \n\nIn the early 6th century BC, the Kingdom of Judah rebelled against the Neo-Babylonian Empire and was destroyed. As a result, the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes were taken into captivity in the city of Babylon. There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of great power, and in 539 BC Cyrus II, the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon.[https://books.google.com/books?idIfxMeDl6BZgC&dq\nThe+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&printsecfrontcover&source\nbn&hlen&ei\n6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n4&ved0CCEQ6AEwAw#v\nonepage&q&f=false Fensham, F.

It was not until the Middle Ages that the two became separated in Jewish Bibles.\n\nFirst Esdras\n\n1 Esdras, also known as \"Esdras α\", is an alternate Greek-language version of Ezra.

Although the content is substantially the same, the verses are numbered differently from Ezra.\n\nStructure, composition and date \n\nStructure\n\nThe contents of Ezra–Nehemiah are structured in a theological rather than chronological order: \"The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law.\"R.J.

The question of when the core of the book originated depends in the first place on the dates assigned to Ezra himself.\n\nKores of Ezra 1:1 is called \"king of Persia\", which title was introduced  not by Cyrus the Great but by his grandson and probable namesake Xerxes (486–465 BC).Roman Ghirshman, Iran (1954), Penguin Books, p 191.\n\nScholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra 7:8 says that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes, while Nehemiah 2:1–9 has Nehemiah arriving in Artaxerxes' twentieth year. If this was Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), then Ezra arrived in 458 and Nehemiah in 445 BC. Nehemiah 8–9, in which the two (possibly by editorial error) appear together, supports this scenario.M. Patrick Graham, The \"Chronicler's History\": Ezra-Nehemiah, 1–2 Chronicles in [https://books.google.com/books?id\nowwhpmIVgSAC&printsecfrontcover&dq\nThe+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&sourcebl&ots\nfUEuF-W9Ul&sigYcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&hl\nen&eiAOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum2&ved\n0CBsQ6AEwAQ#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., \"The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues\" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)], pp. 204–05\n\nIt was proposed that Ezra's Artaxerxes was Artaxerxes II (404–359 BC), and that the sequence should be reversed, with Nehemiah arriving in 445 and Ezra in 398 BC.\n \nThe argument has some persuasive evidence; for example:\n\n*The Elephantine papyri mention the high priest Johanan as a contemporary of Darius II (423–404 BC) at the 17th year of his reign (407 BC).Pritchard, James B. ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton University Press, third edition with supplement 1969, p. 492Bezalel Porten (Author), J. J. Farber (Author), C. J. F. Martin (Author), G. Vittmann (Author), The Elephantine Papyri in English (Documenta Et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui, book 22), Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 1996, p 125-153. Furthermore in the book of Ezra, Artaxerxes follows king Darius (Ezra 6:1), while Johanan (Ezra 10:6) is mentioned as (grand)son (Nehemiah 12:22) of the high priest at the time of Nehemiah, Eliashib (Nehemiah 3:1).\n\n* Nehemiah's mission is to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and Ezra 9:9 notes that Ezra found the walls in place when he arrived, and while Nehemiah lists the returnees who came back with Zerubbabel he seems to know nothing about the 5,000 or so who accompanied Ezra.\n\nIn Ezra 4:8 the text changes from Hebrew to Aramaic, therefore the king's name in Ezra 4:7, also used in the following letter, possibly is the Aramaic version of the king's name AhaSuerus mentioned in Ezra 4:6.\n\nThe above suggests the following identifications:\n\n*Kores in Ezra 1:1 = Xerxes I ((486)/5–465 BC)\n*Artachsasta (Aramaic) in Nehemia 2:1 - 13:6 = Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC)\n*Darius in Ezra 4:24 = Darius II (423–404 BC)\n*Ahasuerus (Hebrew) in Ezra 4:6 and Artachsasta in Ezra 4:7 - 8.1 = Artaxerxes II (404–358 BC)\n\nPersian documents \n\nSeven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra. Their authenticity has been contentious; while some scholars accept them in their current form, most accept only part of them as genuine, while still others reject them entirely. L.L. Grabbe surveys six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concludes that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them.[https://books.google.com/books?idVK2fEzruIn0C&printsec\nfrontcover&dqA+history+of+the+Jews+and+Judaism+in+the+Second+Temple+Period,+Volume+1++Lester+L.+Grabbe&source\ngbs_similarbooks_s&cad1#v\nonepage&qA%20history%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20the%20Second%20Temple%20Period%2C%20Volume%201%20%20Lester%20L.%20Grabbe&f\nfalse Grabbe, L.L., \"A history of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period, Volume 1\" (T&T Clark, 2004)] p.78",

Although the content is substantially the same, the verses are numbered differently from Ezra.\n\nStructure, composition and date \n\nStructure\n\nThe contents of Ezra–Nehemiah are structured in a theological rather than chronological order: \"The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law.\"R.J.

The question of when the core of the book originated depends in the first place on the dates assigned to Ezra himself.\n\nKores of Ezra 1:1 is called \"king of Persia\", which title was introduced  not by Cyrus the Great but by his grandson and probable namesake Xerxes (486–465 BC).Roman Ghirshman, Iran (1954), Penguin Books, p 191.\n\nScholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra 7:8 says that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes, while Nehemiah 2:1–9 has Nehemiah arriving in Artaxerxes' twentieth year. If this was Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), then Ezra arrived in 458 and Nehemiah in 445 BC. Nehemiah 8–9, in which the two (possibly by editorial error) appear together, supports this scenario.M. Patrick Graham, The \"Chronicler's History\": Ezra-Nehemiah, 1–2 Chronicles in [https://books.google.com/books?id\nowwhpmIVgSAC&printsecfrontcover&dq\nThe+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&sourcebl&ots\nfUEuF-W9Ul&sigYcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&hl\nen&eiAOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum2&ved\n0CBsQ6AEwAQ#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., \"The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues\" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)], pp. 204–05\n\nIt was proposed that Ezra's Artaxerxes was Artaxerxes II (404–359 BC), and that the sequence should be reversed, with Nehemiah arriving in 445 and Ezra in 398 BC.\n \nThe argument has some persuasive evidence; for example:\n\n*The Elephantine papyri mention the high priest Johanan as a contemporary of Darius II (423–404 BC) at the 17th year of his reign (407 BC).Pritchard, James B. ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton University Press, third edition with supplement 1969, p. 492Bezalel Porten (Author), J. J. Farber (Author), C. J. F. Martin (Author), G. Vittmann (Author), The Elephantine Papyri in English (Documenta Et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui, book 22), Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 1996, p 125-153. Furthermore in the book of Ezra, Artaxerxes follows king Darius (Ezra 6:1), while Johanan (Ezra 10:6) is mentioned as (grand)son (Nehemiah 12:22) of the high priest at the time of Nehemiah, Eliashib (Nehemiah 3:1).\n\n* Nehemiah's mission is to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and Ezra 9:9 notes that Ezra found the walls in place when he arrived, and while Nehemiah lists the returnees who came back with Zerubbabel he seems to know nothing about the 5,000 or so who accompanied Ezra.\n\nIn Ezra 4:8 the text changes from Hebrew to Aramaic, therefore the king's name in Ezra 4:7, also used in the following letter, possibly is the Aramaic version of the king's name AhaSuerus mentioned in Ezra 4:6.\n\nThe above suggests the following identifications:\n\n*Kores in Ezra 1:1 = Xerxes I ((486)/5–465 BC)\n*Artachsasta (Aramaic) in Nehemia 2:1 - 13:6 = Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC)\n*Darius in Ezra 4:24 = Darius II (423–404 BC)\n*Ahasuerus (Hebrew) in Ezra 4:6 and Artachsasta in Ezra 4:7 - 8.1 = Artaxerxes II (404–358 BC)\n\nPersian documents \n\nSeven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra. Their authenticity has been contentious; while some scholars accept them in their current form, most accept only part of them as genuine, while still others reject them entirely. L.L. Grabbe surveys six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concludes that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them.[https://books.google.com/books?idVK2fEzruIn0C&printsec\nfrontcover&dqA+history+of+the+Jews+and+Judaism+in+the+Second+Temple+Period,+Volume+1++Lester+L.+Grabbe&source\ngbs_similarbooks_s&cad1#v\nonepage&qA%20history%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20the%20Second%20Temple%20Period%2C%20Volume%201%20%20Lester%20L.%20Grabbe&f\nfalse Grabbe, L.L., \"A history of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period, Volume 1\" (T&T Clark, 2004)] p.78.
