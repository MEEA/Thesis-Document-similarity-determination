  "textBody" : "Couscous ( ' ;  ') is a Maghrebi dish of small (about 3mm diameter) steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina, usually served with a stew spooned on top. Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Libya, Egypt, and to a lesser extent in Sicily.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe original name may be derived from the Arabic word Kaskasa, meaning \"to pound small\" or the Berber Seksu, meaning \"well rolled\", \"well formed\", or \"rounded\".\n\nNumerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is sometimes pronounced kuskusi () in Arabic, while it is known in Morocco as seksu ; kesksu or ( ; in Algeria as kosksi  ' (, literally meaning \"food\") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), Sicily cuscusu and keskes in Tuareg.\n\nOrigin and history\n\nThe origin of couscous appears to be in the region from eastern to northern Africa where Berbers used it as early as the 7th century. Recognized as a traditional North African delicacy, it is a common cuisine component among Maghreb countries.\n\nIbn Battuta (b. Morocco, 1304-1368? AD) stated in his Rihlah (Travels), indicating what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in West Africa from the early 1350s:\n\nPreparation\n\nCouscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous.  In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women came together to make large batches over several days, which were then dried in the sun and used for several months. In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold in markets around the world.\n\nIn the Sahelian countries of West Africa, such as Mali and Senegal, pearl millet is pounded or milled to the size and consistency necessary for the couscous.Sivak MN. Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology. Academic Press, 1998, , p. 132\n\nProperly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called aTaseksut in Berber, a  kiskas in Arabic or a couscoussier in French). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth. There is little archaeological evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original couscoussier was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.\n\nIn some regions couscous is made from Farina or coarsely ground barley or pearl millet. In Brazil, the traditional couscous is made from cornmeal.\n\nInstant couscous\n\nThe couscous that is sold in most Western supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous then leaving covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice).\n\nLocal serving variations\n\nIn Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, couscous is generally served with vegetables (carrots, potatoes, turnips, etc.) cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, and some meat (generally, chicken, lamb or mutton).\n\nIn Algeria and Morocco it is also served, sometimes at the end of a meal or just by itself, as a delicacy called \"sfouff\". The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is very fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with almonds, cinnamon and sugar. Traditionally, this dessert is served with milk perfumed with orange flower water, or it can be served plain with buttermilk in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper.\n\nIn Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with harissa sauce and served with almost everything, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef and sometimes in southern regions, camel. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus, squid or other seafood in hot, red, spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served in some regions (mostly during Ramadan), sweetened as a dessert called masfouf.\n\nIn Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically mostly lamb, but also camel, and very rarely beef, in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as \"maghrood\".\n\nIsraelis typically serve it on occasions and holidays. It was brought by Maghrebi migrants from Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya to Israel. The Israeli foodstuff called ptitim or \"Israeli couscous\" is a toasted pasta with several shape variations, including the more common pearled \"couscous\", and the original rice-grain shape, which was nicknamed \"Ben-Gurion rice\".\nUnlike other large types of couscous, which are rolled and coated, ptitim is actually an extruded paste that is molded and baked or toasted, giving the product a chewy texture and a unique nutty flavor. Its appearance resembles large couscous, and the product was named \"couscous\" by Osem, its original producer in Israel, and \"Israeli couscous\" in the US and worldwide.\n\nIn Egypt, couscous is eaten more as a dessert. It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream.\n\nCouscous is also very popular in France, where it is now considered a traditional dish, and has also become common in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish. Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006, for the magazine Notre Temps based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of  people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality. Couscous is served in many Maghrebi restaurants all over the world. In France, Spain and Italy, the word \"couscous\" (cuscús in Spanish and Italian; cuscuz in Portuguese) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish and Italian grocery stores and supermarkets. In France, it is generally served with harissa sauce, a style inherited from the Tunisian cuisine. Indeed, couscous was voted as the third-favourite dish of French people in 2011 in a study by TNS Sofres for magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand, and the first in the east of France.[http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx Les plats préférés des Français] , enquête réalisée en août 2011 pour le magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand auprès d'un échantillon national de  personnes représentatif de l'ensemble de la population âgée de 18 ans et plus, interrogées en face à face. Méthode des quotas (sexe, âge, profession du chef de ménage PCS) et stratification par région et catégorie d’agglomération.\n\nIn North America, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, couscous is available most commonly either plain or pre-flavoured in quick-preparation boxes. In the United States, it is widely available, normally found in the ethnic or health-food section of larger grocery stores.\n\nThere are related recipes in Latin America, where a corn meal mix is boiled and moulded into a timbale with other ingredients. Among them, cuscuz, a popular recipe usually associated with Northeastern Brazil and its diaspora, a steamed cake of corn meal served with sugar and milk, varied meats, cheese and eggs or other ingredients.\n\nIn Palestine, maftoul is considered as a special type of couscous but made from different ingredients and a different shape. It is larger than North African couscous, but is similarly steamed and often served on special occasions in a chicken broth with garbanzo beans and tender pieces of chicken taken off the bone. Maftoul is an Arabic word derived from the root \"fa-ta-la\", which means to roll or to twist, which is exactly describing the method used to make maftoul by hand rolling bulgur with wheat flour. Maftoul is a special dish in Palestinian cuisine and not every cook knows how to prepare it. In fact, there is an annual Maftoul Festival which involves a competition held in Bir Zeit every year.\n\nCouscous with fish soup is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily.\n\nNutrition\n\nCouscous has 3.6 g of protein for every 100 grams.  Furthermore, couscous contains a 1% fat-to-calorie ratio.\n\nSimilar foods\n\nCouscous is distinct from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, in that it is made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed. Burghul or bulgur is a kind of parboiled dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.\n* Attiéké is a variety of couscous that is a staple food in Ivory Coast and is also known to surrounding regions of West Africa, made from grated cassava.\n* Berkoukes are pasta bullets made by the same process but are larger than the grains of couscous.\n* In Brazilian cuisine, the \"cuscuz marroquino\" is a version, usually eaten cold, of the \"couscous\". Brazilian cuscuz is usually made out of cornmeal rather than semolina wheat. Another festive moulded couscous dish containing chicken, vegetables, spices, steamed in a mould and decorated with orange slices is called \"Cuscuz de Galinha\".\n* Kouskousaki (Κουσκουσάκι in Greek or kuskus in Turkish), a pasta from Greece and Turkey, that is boiled and served with cheese and walnuts.\n* In Lebanese cuisine, Jordanian cuisine and Palestinian cuisine, a similar but larger product is known as maftoul or moghrabieh.\n* Ptitim, also known as \"Israeli couscous\", is a larger baked pasta product, which looks - and is often used - just like traditional large-grain couscous.\n* Upma, eaten in South India, Western India, and Sri Lanka is a thick porridge made with dry roasted semolina.
