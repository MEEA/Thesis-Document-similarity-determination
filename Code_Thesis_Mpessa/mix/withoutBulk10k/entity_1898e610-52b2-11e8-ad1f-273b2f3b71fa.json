  "textBody" : "is a Japanese guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki. Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, Hoshino Gakki were one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant foothold in import guitar sales in the United States and Europe, as well as the first brand of guitars to mass-produce the seven-string guitar and eight-string guitar. Ibanez manufactures effects, accessories, amps, and instruments in Japan, China, Indonesia and in the United States (at a Los Angeles-based custom shop). Currently, there are nearly 165 models of bass guitar, 130 acoustic guitars, and more than 300 electric guitars.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hoshino Gakki company began in 1908 as the musical instrument sales division of the Hoshino Shoten, a bookstore chain. The Ibanez brand name dates back to 1929 when Hoshino Gakki began importing Salvador Ibáñez guitars from Spain. After Telésforo Julve bought the company in 1933, Hoshino Gakki decided in 1935 to make Spanish-style acoustic guitars, at first using the \"Ibanez Salvador\" brand name, and later simply \"Ibanez.\"\n\nThe modern era of Ibanez guitars began in 1957, and the late 1950s and 1960s Ibanez catalogues show guitars with some wild looking designs,\n\n manufactured by Kiso Suzuki Violin,\n. Note: the wide variety sorts of musical instruments seen on this catalog reflect their full-time exporter business at that era. Especially, the arched-top guitars and violin-family instruments suggest the involvements of Suzuki Violin in Nagoya and its brother factory, Kiso Suzuki Violin in Kiso. Additionally, their third brother in Matsumoto, Shin'ichi Suzuki is known as a founder of the Suzuki Method, and their cultural activities significantly influenced on the establishment of FujiGen in Matsumoto, according to a co-founder of FujiGen, [http://www.geocities.jp/guitarofworld/MatsumotoGuitars5.html Yuichiro Yokouchi].\n Guyatone,\n (Models: EG 80, EG 80-B, EG 80-H, EG 90)\n\n (Models: No.1830 (2pu), No.1850 (3pu), No.1860 (2pu with tremolo), No.1880 (3pu with tremolo), No.1950 (bass))\n and their own Tama factory established in 1962.\n\n    After Tama factory stopped guitar manufacturing in 1966, Hoshino Gakki used the Teisco and FujiGen Gakki guitar factories to manufacture Ibanez guitars, and after the Teisco guitar factory (Teisco String Instrument, Company) once closed down in 1969/1970, Hoshino Gakki used the FujiGen Gakki guitar factory to make most Ibanez guitars.\n\nIn the 1960s, Japanese guitar makers started to mainly copy American guitar designs, and Ibanez-branded copies of Gibson, Fender and Rickenbacker models started to appear. This resulted in the so-called lawsuit period. During this period, Ibanez produced guitars under the Mann name to avoid authorities in the United States and Canada. \n\nHoshino Gakki introduced Ibanez models that were definitely not copies of the Gibson or Fender designs, such as the Iceman and the Roadstar series. The company has produced its own guitar designs ever since. The late 1980s and early 1990s were an important period for the Ibanez brand. Hoshino Gakki's relationship with guitarist Steve Vai resulted in the introduction of the Ibanez JEM and the Ibanez Universe models; after the earlier successes of the Roadstar and Iceman models in the late 1970s/early 1980s, Hoshino Gakki entered the superstrat market with the RG series, a lower-priced version of their JEM series.\n\nHoshino Gakki also had semi-acoustic, nylon- and steel-stringed acoustic guitars manufactured under the Ibanez name. Most Ibanez guitars were made by the FujiGen guitar factory in Japan up until the mid- to late 1980s, and from then on Ibanez guitars have also been made in other Asian countries such as Korea, China, and Indonesia. During the early 1980s, the FujiGen guitar factory also produced most of the Roland guitar synthesizers, including the Stratocaster-style Roland G-505, the twin-humbucker Roland G-202 (endorsed by Adrian Belew, Eric Clapton, Dean Brown, Jeff Baxter, Yannis Spathas, Christoforos Krokidis, Steve Howe, Mike Rutherford, Andy Summers, Neal Schon and Steve Hackett) and the Ibanez X-ING IMG-2010.\n\nCimar and Starfield were guitar and bass brands owned by Hoshino Gakki. In the 1970s, Hoshino Gakki and Kanda Shokai shared some guitar designs, and so some Ibanez and Greco guitars have the same features. The Greco versions were sold in Japan and the Ibanez versions were sold outside Japan. From 1982, Ibanez guitars have also been sold in Japan as well.\n (based on [http://stratomaniac.com/fujigen-gakki-japan-gitarren/daeschler-fachblatt-musikmagazin Germany version on stratomaniac.com]); Originally published as \n\nGuitar brands such as Antoria and Mann shared some Ibanez guitar designs. The Antoria guitar brand was managed by JT Coppock Leeds Ltd England. CSL was a brand name managed by Charles Summerfield Ltd England. Maurice Summerfield of the Charles Summerfield Ltd company contributed some design ideas to Hoshino Gakki and also imported Ibanez and CSL guitars into the UK from 1964 to 1987. The Maxxas brand name came about because Hoshino Gakki thought that the guitar did not fit in with the Ibanez model range and was therefore named Maxxas by Rich Lasner from Hoshino USA.\n\nThe \"lawsuit\" guitars\n\nHarry Rosenbloom, founder of the (now-closed) Medley Music of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, was manufacturing handmade guitars under the name \"Elger.\" By 1965, Rosenbloom had decided to stop manufacturing guitars and chose to become the exclusive North American distributor for Ibanez guitars. In September 1972, Hoshino began a partnership with Elger Guitars to import guitars from Japan.  In September 1981, Elger was renamed \"Hoshino U.S.A.\", retaining the company headquarters in Bensalem, Pennsylvania as a distribution and quality-control center.\n\nOn  June 28, 1977, in the Philadelphia Federal District Court, a lawsuit was filed by the Norlin Corporation, the parent company of Gibson Guitars, against Elger/Hoshino U.S.A.'s use of the Gibson headstock design and logo. Hoshino settled out of court in early 1978 and the case was officially closed on February 2, 1978.\n\nAfter the lawsuit, Hoshino Gakki abandoned the strategy of copying \"classic\" electric guitar designs, having already introduced a plethora of original designs. Hoshino was producing their original Artist models from 1974, introducing a set-neck model in 1975. In 1977, they upgraded and extended their Artist range and introduced a number of other top-quality original designs made to match or surpass famous American brands: the Performer and short-lived Concert ranges which competed with the Les Paul; through-neck Musicians; Studios in fixed- and through-neck construction; the radically shaped Iceman; and the Roadster which morphed into the Roadstar range, precursor to the popular superstrat era in the mid-1980s. The newer Ibanez models began incorporating more modern elements into their design such as radical body shapes, slimmer necks, 2-octave fingerboards, slim pointed headstocks, higher-output electronics, humbucker/single-coil/humbucker (H/S/H) pickup configurations, locking tremolo bridges and different finishes.\n\nGuitars\n\nSub-brands\n\n;Ibanez J. Custom\nThe J. Custom series are the most exclusive and high-end custom shop guitars Ibanez offers. They are \"Envisioned to be the finest Japanese-made guitar in history\". Built by some of the most skilled luthiers Ibanez has to offer, they \"represent every advance in design and technology Ibanez has developed over the last 20 years\". They feature aftermarket pickups (Seymour Duncan Jazz & Custom 5 in the 6 string model and DiMarzio PAF-7 pickups in the 7 string model,) 5 piece maple/wenge necks with Titanium reinforcement rods, a rosewood fingerboard with a tree of life fret board inlay, and Edge Zero tremolo systems.\n\n;Ibanez Prestige\nThe Prestige guitars are Ibanez's top of the line models that are built in Japan. They feature higher quality materials, high craftsmanship, and higher quality bridges compared to other models.\n\n;Ibanez Premium\nThe Premium guitars are similar to other models but are built in Ibanez's Indonesian premium factory to premium quality standards.\n\n;Ibanez Gio\nThe Ibanez Gio are Ibanez' budget guitars, designed for high playability at low costs.

Since then, the RG series has introduced fixed bridge models, but Ibanez still produces the RGA series with an arched top to differentiate from the RG series. The arched top allows for added comfort while playing the guitar.\n\n;Ibanez RGD\nThe Ibanez RGD guitar was developed for heavy metal guitar players.\n The RGD features a 26.5\" scale which allows for lower than standard guitar tuning while retaining standard string tension without use of thicker gauge strings.

Ibanez currently makes two Ibanez RGD Prestige models.\n;Ibanez S\nThe Ibanez S (Saber\n) guitar has an extremely thin body made out of mahogany, and is available in 6, 7 and 8-string models. They may come with either 22 or 24 frets, depending on year of manufacture. The standard line currently have Wizard III necks that are slightly wider and thicker than the original Wizard. All S models have bodies that are thicker in the middle where the pickups are, and taper off towards the outer edges. The guitars use ZR (Zero Resistance), Lo-TRS, and variants of the Edge bridge system as well as fixed bridges. Ibanez currently makes 8 Prestige S-Series guitars.\n;Ibanez DN\nThe Ibanez DN guitar (DN stands for Darkstone) was developed for heavy metal guitar players. The main features of the DN are that it has a set-in neck for speed and playing comfort, medium frets, and coil tapped pickups. This guitar is currently discontinued.\n;Ibanez X\nThe Ibanez X guitars are Ibanez guitars that feature unconventional and unique body designs. An example would be the Ibanez Xiphos, which is stylized to look like the letter X.\n For all X guitars currently available and for more information, check the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140102173319/http://www.ibanez.co.jp/products/u_eg_top13.php?year2013&cat_id\n1 Ibanez Electric Guitar page in 2013].

The Maxxas brand name came about because Hoshino Gakki thought that the guitar did not fit in with the Ibanez model range and was therefore named Maxxas by Rich Lasner from Hoshino USA.\n\nThe \"lawsuit\" guitars\n\nHarry Rosenbloom, founder of the (now-closed) Medley Music of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, was manufacturing handmade guitars under the name \"Elger.\" By 1965, Rosenbloom had decided to stop manufacturing guitars and chose to become the exclusive North American distributor for Ibanez guitars. In September 1972, Hoshino began a partnership with Elger Guitars to import guitars from Japan.  In September 1981, Elger was renamed \"Hoshino U.S.A.\", retaining the company headquarters in Bensalem, Pennsylvania as a distribution and quality-control center.\n\nOn  June 28, 1977, in the Philadelphia Federal District Court, a lawsuit was filed by the Norlin Corporation, the parent company of Gibson Guitars, against Elger/Hoshino U.S.A.'s use of the Gibson headstock design and logo. Hoshino settled out of court in early 1978 and the case was officially closed on February 2, 1978.\n\nAfter the lawsuit, Hoshino Gakki abandoned the strategy of copying \"classic\" electric guitar designs, having already introduced a plethora of original designs. Hoshino was producing their original Artist models from 1974, introducing a set-neck model in 1975. In 1977, they upgraded and extended their Artist range and introduced a number of other top-quality original designs made to match or surpass famous American brands: the Performer and short-lived Concert ranges which competed with the Les Paul; through-neck Musicians; Studios in fixed- and through-neck construction; the radically shaped Iceman; and the Roadster which morphed into the Roadstar range, precursor to the popular superstrat era in the mid-1980s. The newer Ibanez models began incorporating more modern elements into their design such as radical body shapes, slimmer necks, 2-octave fingerboards, slim pointed headstocks, higher-output electronics, humbucker/single-coil/humbucker (H/S/H) pickup configurations, locking tremolo bridges and different finishes.\n\nGuitars\n\nSub-brands\n\n;Ibanez J.

Since then, the RG series has introduced fixed bridge models, but Ibanez still produces the RGA series with an arched top to differentiate from the RG series. The arched top allows for added comfort while playing the guitar.\n\n;Ibanez RGD\nThe Ibanez RGD guitar was developed for heavy metal guitar players.\n The RGD features a 26.5\" scale which allows for lower than standard guitar tuning while retaining standard string tension without use of thicker gauge strings.

Ibanez currently makes two Ibanez RGD Prestige models.\n;Ibanez S\nThe Ibanez S (Saber\n) guitar has an extremely thin body made out of mahogany, and is available in 6, 7 and 8-string models. They may come with either 22 or 24 frets, depending on year of manufacture. The standard line currently have Wizard III necks that are slightly wider and thicker than the original Wizard. All S models have bodies that are thicker in the middle where the pickups are, and taper off towards the outer edges. The guitars use ZR (Zero Resistance), Lo-TRS, and variants of the Edge bridge system as well as fixed bridges. Ibanez currently makes 8 Prestige S-Series guitars.\n;Ibanez DN\nThe Ibanez DN guitar (DN stands for Darkstone) was developed for heavy metal guitar players. The main features of the DN are that it has a set-in neck for speed and playing comfort, medium frets, and coil tapped pickups. This guitar is currently discontinued.\n;Ibanez X\nThe Ibanez X guitars are Ibanez guitars that feature unconventional and unique body designs. An example would be the Ibanez Xiphos, which is stylized to look like the letter X.\n For all X guitars currently available and for more information, check the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140102173319/http://www.ibanez.co.jp/products/u_eg_top13.php?year2013&cat_id\n1 Ibanez Electric Guitar page in 2013].
