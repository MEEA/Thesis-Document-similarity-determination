  "textBody" : "HMS Dunraven was a Q-Ship of the Royal Navy during World War I.\n\nOn 8 August 1917, 130 miles southwest of Ushant in the Bay of Biscay, disguised as the collier Boverton and commanded by Gordon Campbell, VC, Dunraven spotted , commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Reinhold Saltzwedel.  Saltzwedel believed the disguised ship was a merchant vessel.  The U-boat submerged and closed with Dunraven before surfacing astern at 11:43 am and opening fire at long range.  Dunraven made smoke and sent off a panic party (a small number of men who \"abandon ship\" during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant).\n\nShells began hitting Dunraven, detonating her depth charges and setting her stern afire.  Her crew remained hidden letting the fires burn.  Then a 4 inch (102 mm) gun and crew were blown away revealing Dunravens identity as a warship, and UC-71 submerged.  A second \"panic party\" abandoned ship.  Dunraven was hit by a torpedo.  A third \"panic party\" went over the side, leaving only two guns manned.  UC-71 surfaced, shelled Dunraven and again submerged.  Campbell replied with two torpedoes that missed, and around 3 pm, the undamaged U-boat left that area. Only one of Dunravens crew was killed, but the Q-Ship was sinking.\n\nThe British destroyer  picked up Dunravens survivors and took her in tow for Plymouth, but Dunraven sank at 1:30 am early on 10 August 1917 to the north of Ushant.\n\nIn recognition, two Victoria Crosses were awarded, one to the ship's First Lieutenant, Lt.
