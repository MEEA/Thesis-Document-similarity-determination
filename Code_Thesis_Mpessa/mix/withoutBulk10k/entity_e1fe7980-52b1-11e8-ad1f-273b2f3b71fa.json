She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name Four Bitchin' Babes.  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including her latest Just One Angel, 22 singer/songwriters singing Christmas/Hanukah/Solstice/New Year's songs including actor Jeff Daniels, Grammy-winners Janis Ian and Julie Gold, and the Guitar Man Of Central Park David Ippolito.\n\nShe is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances.
