  "textBody" : "An epitaph (from Greek  epitaphios \"a funeral oration\" from ἐπί epi \"at, over\" and τάφος taphos \"tomb\") is a short text honoring a deceased person. Strictly speaking, it refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone or plaque, but it may also be used in a figurative sense. Some epitaphs are specified by the person themselves before their death, while others are chosen by those responsible for the burial.  An epitaph may be written in prose or in poem verse; poets have been known to compose their own epitaphs prior to their death, as did William Shakespeare.Photograph of William Shakespear's grave, 3 June 2007\n\nMost epitaphs are brief records of the family, and perhaps the career, of the deceased, often with a common expression of love or respect—for example, \"beloved father of ...\"—but others are more ambitious.  From the Renaissance to the 19th century in Western culture, epitaphs for notable people became increasingly lengthy and pompous descriptions of their family origins, career, virtues and immediate family, often in Latin.  Notably, the Laudatio Turiae, the longest known Ancient Roman epitaph, exceeds almost all of these at 180 lines; it celebrates the virtues of an honored wife, probably of a consul.\n\nSome are quotes from holy texts, or aphorisms. One approach of many epitaphs is to 'speak' to the reader and warn them about their own mortality. A wry trick of others is to request the reader to get off their resting place, inasmuch as the reader would have to be standing on the ground above the coffin to read the inscription. Some record achievements (e.g., past politicians note the years of their terms of office). Nearly all (excepting those where this is impossible by definition, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier) note name, year or date of birth, and date of death. Many list family members and the relationship of the deceased to them (for example, \"Father / Mother / Son / Daughter of\").\n\nNotable examples \n\nHeroes and Kings your distance keep;\nIn peace let one poor poet sleep,\nWho never flattered folks like you;\nLet Horace blush and Virgil too.\n— Alexander Pope\n\nWe must know.

The South African poet Gert Vlok Nel wrote an (originally) untitled song, which appeared on his first music album 'Beaufort-Wes se Beautiful Woorde' as 'Epitaph', because his producer Eckard Potgieter told him that the song sounded like an epitaph.

The ashes were accompanied by a laser-engraved epitaph on a small piece of foil.
