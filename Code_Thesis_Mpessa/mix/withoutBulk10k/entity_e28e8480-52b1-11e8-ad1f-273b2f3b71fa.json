  "textBody" : "The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian code of law of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology).  It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a 2.25 metre (7.5 ft) stone stele and consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man or woman.Gabriele Bartz, Eberhard König, (Arts and Architecture), Könemann, Köln, (2005), . The laws were based with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye\" depending on social status.\n\nNearly one-half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently.[http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html Code of Hammurabi]  at commonlaw.com   A few provisions address issues related to military service.\n\nThe code was discovered by modern archaeologists in 1901, and its editio princeps translation published in 1902 by Jean-Vincent Scheil.

The code is inscribed in the Akkadian language, using cuneiform script carved into the stele.

In the preface to the law, he states, \"Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like Shamash, and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind.\" On the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws.

The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups, so that all who read the laws would know what was required of them.\"The Code of Hammurabi: Introduction,\" [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/hamcode.asp], Ancient History Sourcebook, March 1998, retrieved on 2 November 2011. Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (c. 2050 BC), the Laws of Eshnunna (c. 1930 BC) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c. 1870 BC), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law.Barton, G.A: Archaeology and the Bible. University of Michigan Library, 2009, (originally published in 1916 by American Sunday-School Union) p.406.\nThese codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.Barton 2009, p.406. Barton, a scientist of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1931, stated that while there are similarities between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi, a study of the entirety of both laws \"convinces the student that the laws of the Old Testament are in no essential way dependent upon the Babylonian laws.\" He states that \"such resemblances\" arose from \"a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook\" between the two cultures, but that \"the striking differences show that there was no direct borrowing.\"\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.\"The Code of Hammurabi,\" [http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/hammurabi.html], The History Guide, 3 August 2009, Retrieved on 2 November 2011. The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government — i.e., a primitive constitution.What is a Constitution? William David Thomas, Gareth Stevens (2008) p. 8Flach, Jacques.  Le Code de Hammourabi et la constitution originaire de la propriete dans l'ancienne Chaldee. (Revue historique.  Paris, 1907. 8. v. 94, p. 272-289. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence.Victimology: Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103 The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.For this alternative interpretation see Jean Bottéro, \"The 'Code' of Hammurabi\" in Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods (University of Chicago, 1992), pp. 156–184.\n\nWhile the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves. Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status. For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required. Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.\n\nOther copies\n\nVarious copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated basalt stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscribed squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (currently dated to the early 18th century BC).Fant, Clyde E. and Mitchell G.
