Whether or not an ellipsis at the end of a sentence needs a fourth dot to finish the sentence is a matter of debate; for example, Chicago advises it, but the OxfordWords blog has suggested that a full stop is considered to be paradoxical to an ellipsis used to indicate an incomplete thought, so it is omitted.\n\nThe triple-dot punctuation mark is also called a suspension point, points of ellipsis, periods of ellipsis, or colloquially, \"dot-dot-dot\". According to Anne Toner it is difficult to establish when this verbal phrase was first used. There is an early instance, which is perhaps the first in a piece of fiction - in Virginia Woolf's short story 'An Unwritten Novel' (1920). See Anne TonerEllipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission (Cambridge University Press, 2015), 151. \n\nIn writing\n\nIn her book on the ellipsis, Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission (Cambridge University Press, 2015), Anne Toner suggests that the first use of the punctuation in the English language dates to a 1588 translation of Terence's Andria, by Maurice Kyffin. In this case, however, the ellipsis consists not of dots but of short dashes.[http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/dot-dot-dot-how-the-ellipsis-made-its-mark … dot, dot, dot: how the ellipsis made its mark], Research Impact, Cambridge University  \"Subpuncting\" of medieval manuscripts also denotes omitted meaning and may be related.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, an ellipsis was often used when a writer intentionally omitted a specific proper noun, such as a location: \"Jan was born on . . . Street in Warsaw.\"\n\nAs commonly used, this juxtaposition of characters is referred to as \"dots of ellipsis\" in the English language.\n\nOccasionally, it would be used in pulp fiction and other works of early 20th-century fiction to denote expletives that would otherwise have been censored.Raymond Chandler, Frank MacShane.

For example, when Sue says \"I never drink wine . . . \", the implication is that she does drink something elsesuch as vodka.\n\nIn reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an intentional silence.\n\nIn poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or line break at the caesura  or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader think about the last points in the poem.\n\nIn news reporting, often associated with brackets, it is used to indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or relevance.\n\nHerb Caen, Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, became famous for his \"three-dot journalism\".[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/492296/HERB-CAEN-WAY----HONORS-SF-COLUMNIST.html `HERB CAEN WAY . . .' HONORS S.F. COLUMNIST], in the Deseret News; published May 29, 1996; retrieved September 5, 2017\n\nIn different languages\n\nIn American English\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style suggests the use of an ellipsis for any omitted word, phrase, line, or paragraph from within but not at the end of a quoted passage. There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots: . . .) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots: . ...).\n\nThe Modern Language Association (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, square brackets must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [ . . . ]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.Fowler, H. Ramsey, Jane E. Aaron, Murray McArthur. The Little, Brown Handbook. Fourth Canadian Edition. Toronto: Pearson Longman. 2005. p. 440.\n\nThe MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis ( … ) should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (. . . . ) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. \"text […] text\").http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.Goldstein, Norm, editor. \"Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law\". 2005. pp.328–329.\n\nAccording to Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style, the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is \"another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide\"—he recommends using flush dots, or thin-spaced dots (up to one-fifth of an em), or the prefabricated ellipsis character (Unicode U+2026, Latin entity …). Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:\n\nIn legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the Bluebook citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three asterisks (*** or * * *) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.\n(...) is also used for awkward silence.\n\nIn British English\n\nThe Oxford Style Guide recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (…) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (. . .), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014.\n\nThe … fox jumped …\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. … And if they have not died, they are still alive today.\n\nContrary to The Oxford Style Guide, the University of Oxford Style Guide demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full stop.[https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide%20%28updated%20Hilary%20term%202016%29.pdf University of Oxford Style Guide: Hilary term 2016] (PDF).

Retrieved 18 May 2017.\n\nThe…fox jumped…\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog…And if they have not died, they are still alive today.\nIt is not cold… it is freezing cold.\n\nIn Polish\n\nWhen applied in Polish language syntax, the ellipsis is called , which means \"multidot\". The word wielokropek distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of mathematical notation, in which it is known as an .\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document PN-83/P-55366,  (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\nIn Russian\n\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?..\n\nIn Japanese\n\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called 3-ten rīdā (\"3-dot leaders\", ). 2-ten rīdā exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two 3-ten rīdā characters, ). Three dots (one 3-ten rīdā character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the baseline and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese Windows fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \"\", the dots are colloquially called \"\" (, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\").\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"pregnant pause\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions. As a device, the ten-ten-ten is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\nIn Chinese\n\nIn Chinese, the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. ……).省略号\n\nIn Spanish\n\nIn Spanish, ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of et cetera at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nOther use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipse is placed alone into a parenthesis (...) or—less often—between brackets […], which is what happens usually within a text transcription, it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipse does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\nIn French\n\nIn French, the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent et cetera. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: comme ça… pas comme ceci. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: Lui? … vaut rien, je crois… .\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be  indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example:  … à Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse […] .\n\nIn German\n\nIn German, the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German style: The first el...is stands for omitted letters, the second ... for an omitted word.\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.\n\nExample: I think that ...\n\nUsage in menus \n\nIn computer menu functions or buttons, an appended ellipsis means that on selection another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice.[https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/menus/menu-anatomy/ developer.apple.com: Menu and Menu Item Titles] If the ellipse is missing, the function is already executed on selection.\n* \"Save\" - the file will be overwritten without further input.\n* \"Save as ...\" - in the following dialog, you can, for example, select another location or file name or other file format.\n\nIn mathematical notation\n\nAn ellipsis is also often used in mathematics to mean \"and so forth\". In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:\n\n1,2,3,\\ldots,100\n\nor to mean an infinite list, as:\n\n1,2,3,\\ldots\n\nTo indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:\n\n1+2+3+\\cdots+100\n\n(though sometimes, for example, in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summationsМильчин А. Э. [http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/Издательский%20словарь/Многоточие%20в%20математических%20формулах/ Издательский словарь-справочник].— Изд. 3-е, испр. и доп., Электронное — М.: ОЛМА-Пресс, 2006. (in Russian)).\n\nThe latter formula means the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to 100. However, it is not a formally defined mathematical symbol. Repeated summations or products may similarly be denoted using capital sigma and capital pi notation, respectively:\n\n1+2+3+\\cdots+100\\ \\sum_{n\n1}^{100} n\n1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 100\\ \\prod_{n\n1}^{100} n = 100! (see factorial)\n\nNormally dots should be used only where the pattern to be followed is clear, the exception being to show the indefinite continuation of an irrational number such as:\n\n\\pi=3.14159265\\ldots\n\nSometimes, it is useful to display a formula compactly, for example:\n\n1+4+9+\\cdots+n^2+\\cdots+400\n\nAnother example is the set of zeros of the cosine function:\n\n\\left\\{\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pm\\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots \\right\\}\n\nThere are many related uses of the ellipsis in set notation.\n\nThe diagonal and vertical forms of the ellipsis are particularly useful for showing missing terms in matrices, such as the size-n identity matrix:\n\nI_n = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nThe use of ellipses in mathematical proofs is often discouraged because of the potential for ambiguity.  For this reason, and because the ellipsis supports no systematic rules for symbolic calculation, in recent years some authors have recommended avoiding its use in mathematics altogether.Roland Backhouse, Program Construction: Calculating Implementations from Specifications.  Wiley (2003), page 138\n\nProgramming languages \n\nA two- or three-dot ellipsis is used as an operator in some programming languages. The precise meaning varies by language, but it generally involves something dealing with multiple items. One of its most common uses is in defining ranges or sequences. This is used in many languages, including Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash shell and F#. It is also used to indicate so called variadic functions in the C, C++ and Java languages. See Ellipsis (programming operator).\n\nHTML and CSS\n\nThe CSS text-overflow property can be set to ellipsis, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.\n\nOn the Internet and in text messaging\n\nThe ellipsis is a non-verbal cue that is often used in computer-mediated interactions, in particular in synchronous genres, such as chat. The reason behind its popularity is the fact that it allows people to indicate in writing several  functions:\n* The sign of ellipsis can function as a floor holding device, and signal that more is to come, for instance when people break up longer turns in chat.\n* Dot-dot-dot can be used systematically to enact linguistic politeness, for instance indicating topic change or hesitation.\n* Suspension dots can be turn construction units to signal silence, for example when indicating disagreement, disapproval or confusion.\n\nAlthough an ellipsis is technically complete with three periods (...), its rise in popularity as a \"trailing-off\" or \"silence\" indicator, particularly in mid-20th-century comic strip and comic book prose writing, has led to expanded uses online. Today, extended ellipsis anywhere from two to dozens of periods have become common constructions in Internet chat rooms and text messages.  The extent of repetition in itself might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue, to \"extend the lexical meaning of the words, add character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation of the message\".\n\nComputer representations\n\nIn computing, several ellipsis characters have been codified, depending on the system used.\n\nIn the Unicode standard, there are the following characters:\n\nIn Windows, it can be inserted with .\n\nIn OS X, it can be inserted with  (on an English language keyboard).\n\nIn some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with , or alternatively    sequence can be used.\n\nIn Chinese and sometimes in Japanese, ellipsis characters are made by entering two consecutive horizontal ellipsis (U+2026). In vertical texts, the application should rotate the symbol accordingly.\n\nUnicode recognizes a series of three period characters (U+002E) as compatibility equivalent (though not canonical) to the horizontal ellipsis character.[http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt UnicodeData.txt]: 2026;HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS;Po;0;ON; 002E 002E 002E;;;;N;;;;;\n\nIn HTML, the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the entity reference … (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis character by the entity reference &vellip; (since HTML 5.0). Alternatively, in HTML, XML, and SGML, a numeric character reference such as … or … can be used.\n\nIn the TeX typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are available:\n\nIn LaTeX, note that the reverse orientation of \\ddots can be achieved with \\reflectbox provided by the graphicx package: \\reflectbox{\\ddots} yields .\n\nWith the amsmath package from AMS-LaTeX, more specific ellipses are provided for math mode.[ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf#page=16 User's Guide for the amsmath Package]. American Mathematical Society, 1999, p. 12.\n\nThe horizontal ellipsis character also appears in the following older character maps:\n* in Windows-1250—Windows-1258 and in IBM/MS-DOS Code page 874, at code 85 (hexadecimal)\n* in Mac-Roman, Mac-CentEuro and several other Macintosh encodings, at code C9 (hexadecimal)\n* in Ventura International encoding at code C1 (hexadecimal)\n\nNote that ISO/IEC 8859 encoding series provides no code point for ellipsis.\n\nAs with all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range, the author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is being used, resulting in mojibake.\n\nThe Chicago Style Q&A recommends to avoid the use of … (U+2026) character in manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (. . .) instead, so that an editor, publisher, or designer can replace them later.\n\nIn Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), the ellipsis is used as an extension marker to indicate the possibility of type extensions in future revisions of a protocol specification. In a type constraint expression like A ::INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511) an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form A ::\n INTEGER (0..127, ...) and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form A ::INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511) constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: B ::\n SEQUENCE { a INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }",

The word wielokropek distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of mathematical notation, in which it is known as an .\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document PN-83/P-55366,  (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\nIn Russian\n\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?..\n\nIn Japanese\n\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called 3-ten rīdā (\"3-dot leaders\", ). 2-ten rīdā exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two 3-ten rīdā characters, ). Three dots (one 3-ten rīdā character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the baseline and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese Windows fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \"\", the dots are colloquially called \"\" (, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\").\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"pregnant pause\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions. As a device, the ten-ten-ten is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\nIn Chinese\n\nIn Chinese, the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. ……).省略号\n\nIn Spanish\n\nIn Spanish, ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of et cetera at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nOther use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipse is placed alone into a parenthesis (...) or—less often—between brackets […], which is what happens usually within a text transcription, it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipse does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\nIn French\n\nIn French, the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent et cetera. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: comme ça… pas comme ceci. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: Lui? … vaut rien, je crois… .\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be  indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example:  … à Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse […] .\n\nIn German\n\nIn German, the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German style: The first el...is stands for omitted letters, the second ... for an omitted word.\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.\n\nExample: I think that ...\n\nUsage in menus \n\nIn computer menu functions or buttons, an appended ellipsis means that on selection another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice.[https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/menus/menu-anatomy/ developer.apple.com: Menu and Menu Item Titles] If the ellipse is missing, the function is already executed on selection.\n* \"Save\" - the file will be overwritten without further input.\n* \"Save as ...\" - in the following dialog, you can, for example, select another location or file name or other file format.\n\nIn mathematical notation\n\nAn ellipsis is also often used in mathematics to mean \"and so forth\". In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:\n\n1,2,3,\\ldots,100\n\nor to mean an infinite list, as:\n\n1,2,3,\\ldots\n\nTo indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:\n\n1+2+3+\\cdots+100\n\n(though sometimes, for example, in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summationsМильчин А. Э. [http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/Издательский%20словарь/Многоточие%20в%20математических%20формулах/ Издательский словарь-справочник].— Изд. 3-е, испр. и доп., Электронное — М.: ОЛМА-Пресс, 2006. (in Russian)).\n\nThe latter formula means the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to 100. However, it is not a formally defined mathematical symbol. Repeated summations or products may similarly be denoted using capital sigma and capital pi notation, respectively:\n\n1+2+3+\\cdots+100\\ \\sum_{n\n1}^{100} n\n1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 100\\ \\prod_{n\n1}^{100} n = 100! (see factorial)\n\nNormally dots should be used only where the pattern to be followed is clear, the exception being to show the indefinite continuation of an irrational number such as:\n\n\\pi=3.14159265\\ldots\n\nSometimes, it is useful to display a formula compactly, for example:\n\n1+4+9+\\cdots+n^2+\\cdots+400\n\nAnother example is the set of zeros of the cosine function:\n\n\\left\\{\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pm\\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots \\right\\}\n\nThere are many related uses of the ellipsis in set notation.\n\nThe diagonal and vertical forms of the ellipsis are particularly useful for showing missing terms in matrices, such as the size-n identity matrix:\n\nI_n = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nThe use of ellipses in mathematical proofs is often discouraged because of the potential for ambiguity.  For this reason, and because the ellipsis supports no systematic rules for symbolic calculation, in recent years some authors have recommended avoiding its use in mathematics altogether.Roland Backhouse, Program Construction: Calculating Implementations from Specifications.  Wiley (2003), page 138\n\nProgramming languages \n\nA two- or three-dot ellipsis is used as an operator in some programming languages. The precise meaning varies by language, but it generally involves something dealing with multiple items. One of its most common uses is in defining ranges or sequences. This is used in many languages, including Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash shell and F#. It is also used to indicate so called variadic functions in the C, C++ and Java languages. See Ellipsis (programming operator).\n\nHTML and CSS\n\nThe CSS text-overflow property can be set to ellipsis, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.\n\nOn the Internet and in text messaging\n\nThe ellipsis is a non-verbal cue that is often used in computer-mediated interactions, in particular in synchronous genres, such as chat. The reason behind its popularity is the fact that it allows people to indicate in writing several  functions:\n* The sign of ellipsis can function as a floor holding device, and signal that more is to come, for instance when people break up longer turns in chat.\n* Dot-dot-dot can be used systematically to enact linguistic politeness, for instance indicating topic change or hesitation.\n* Suspension dots can be turn construction units to signal silence, for example when indicating disagreement, disapproval or confusion.\n\nAlthough an ellipsis is technically complete with three periods (...), its rise in popularity as a \"trailing-off\" or \"silence\" indicator, particularly in mid-20th-century comic strip and comic book prose writing, has led to expanded uses online. Today, extended ellipsis anywhere from two to dozens of periods have become common constructions in Internet chat rooms and text messages.  The extent of repetition in itself might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue, to \"extend the lexical meaning of the words, add character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation of the message\".\n\nComputer representations\n\nIn computing, several ellipsis characters have been codified, depending on the system used.\n\nIn the Unicode standard, there are the following characters:\n\nIn Windows, it can be inserted with .\n\nIn OS X, it can be inserted with  (on an English language keyboard).\n\nIn some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with , or alternatively    sequence can be used.\n\nIn Chinese and sometimes in Japanese, ellipsis characters are made by entering two consecutive horizontal ellipsis (U+2026). In vertical texts, the application should rotate the symbol accordingly.\n\nUnicode recognizes a series of three period characters (U+002E) as compatibility equivalent (though not canonical) to the horizontal ellipsis character.[http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt UnicodeData.txt]: 2026;HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS;Po;0;ON; 002E 002E 002E;;;;N;;;;;\n\nIn HTML, the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the entity reference … (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis character by the entity reference &vellip; (since HTML 5.0). Alternatively, in HTML, XML, and SGML, a numeric character reference such as … or … can be used.\n\nIn the TeX typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are available:\n\nIn LaTeX, note that the reverse orientation of \\ddots can be achieved with \\reflectbox provided by the graphicx package: \\reflectbox{\\ddots} yields .\n\nWith the amsmath package from AMS-LaTeX, more specific ellipses are provided for math mode.[ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf#page=16 User's Guide for the amsmath Package]. American Mathematical Society, 1999, p. 12.\n\nThe horizontal ellipsis character also appears in the following older character maps:\n* in Windows-1250—Windows-1258 and in IBM/MS-DOS Code page 874, at code 85 (hexadecimal)\n* in Mac-Roman, Mac-CentEuro and several other Macintosh encodings, at code C9 (hexadecimal)\n* in Ventura International encoding at code C1 (hexadecimal)\n\nNote that ISO/IEC 8859 encoding series provides no code point for ellipsis.\n\nAs with all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range, the author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is being used, resulting in mojibake.\n\nThe Chicago Style Q&A recommends to avoid the use of … (U+2026) character in manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (. . .) instead, so that an editor, publisher, or designer can replace them later.\n\nIn Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), the ellipsis is used as an extension marker to indicate the possibility of type extensions in future revisions of a protocol specification. In a type constraint expression like A ::INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511) an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form A ::\n INTEGER (0..127, ...) and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form A ::INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511) constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: B ::\n SEQUENCE { a INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }. Ellipsis. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9596."
