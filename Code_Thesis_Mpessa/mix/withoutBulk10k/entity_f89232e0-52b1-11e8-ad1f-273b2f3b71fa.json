  "textBody" : "The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake, only a few kilometres south of central Melbourne. It is used annually as a racetrack for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix, Supercars Championship Melbourne 400 and associated support races. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 licence. In spite of being a circuit on public roads it has characteristics of a natural road course considering it being fast and flowing combined with extensive runoff in many corners.\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix has always been more of a promoter event than a profit-raiser in itself. The contract was prolonged until 2023, although tobacco advertising has been banned since 2007.\n\nDesign\n\nThe circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake, a small man-altered lake (originally a large lagoon formed as part of the ancient Yarra River course) just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne.  The road sections that are used were rebuilt prior to the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness.  As a result, compared to other circuits that are held on public roads, the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface. Before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the Formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track. Many of the new tracks, such as Valencia, Singapore and Abu Dhabi have imitated that feature.\n\nThe course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive, drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times.  However, the flat terrain around the lake, coupled with a track design that features few true straights, means that the track is not conducive to overtaking or easy spectating unless in possession of a grandstand seat.\n\nEach year, most of the trackside fencing, pedestrian overpasses, grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure are erected approximately two months prior to the Grand Prix weekend and removed within 6 weeks after the event.  Land around the circuit (including a large aquatic centre, a golf course, a Lakeside Stadium, some restaurants and rowing boathouses) has restricted access during the grand prix weekend.  Dissent is still prevalent among nearby local residents and users of those others facilities, and some still maintain a silent protest against the event.  Nevertheless, the event is reasonably popular in Melbourne and Australia (with a large European population and a general interest in motorsport). Middle Park, the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park.\n\nOn 4 July 2008, the official F1 site reported that more than 300,000 people attended the four-day Melbourne Grand Prix, though actual ticket sales were later disputed by the local media. The Grand Prix will continue until at least 2020 after securing a new contract with Formula One Management. There has never been a night race at Albert Park, however, 2009’s event started at 5.00 p.m.\n\nEveryday access\n\nDuring the nine months of the year when the track is not required for Grand Prix preparation or the race weekend, most of the track can be driven by ordinary street-registered vehicles either clockwise or anti-clockwise.\n\nOnly the sections between turns 3, 4 and 5, then 5 and 6, differ significantly from the race track configuration. Turn 4 is replaced by a car park access road running directly from turns 3 to 5. Between turns 5 and 6, the road is blocked. It is possible to drive from turn 5 on to Albert Road and back on to the track at turn 7 though two sets of lights control the flow of this option. The only set of lights on the actual track is halfway between turns 12 and 13, where drivers using Queens Road are catered for. The chicanes at turns 11 and 12 is considerably more open than that used in the grand prix, using the escape roads. Turn 9 is also a car park and traffic is directed down another escape road.\n\nThe speed limit is generally 50 km/h which is slower than an F1 car under pit lane speed restrictions. Some short sections have a speed limit of 40 km/h. The back of the track, turns 7 to 13 inclusive, is known as Lakeside Drive. Double lines separate the two-way traffic along most of Lakeside Drive with short road islands approximately every 50 metres. This means overtaking is illegal here.\n\nApproximately 50% of the track edge is lined with short parkland-style chain-linked fencing leaving normal drivers less room for error than F1 drivers have during race weekend. There is however substantial shoulder room between the outside of each lane and the fencing.\n\nSupport races 2018\n\nPorsche Carrera Cup\n\nA major milestone for the Carrera Cup racing was achieved in Australia with the 100th round of the Porsche series utilizing four generations of the 911 GT3 race cars. 50 drivers have stood on the Carrera Cup podium over the 13 seasons and 294 races. Alex Davison took first place in the final race and Cameron McConville came second.\n\nCAMS Australian GT Championship\n\nLargest field of Level 1 race cars in Australia, 35 GT3 high end exotic cars compete in the fastest car race other than Formula 1 at Albert Park. This CAMS Australian GT Championship season opener was live streamed for the first time on mobile devices, the streaming technology has been utilised in an attempt to increase the championship’s growth.\n\nCoates Hire Supercars Melbourne 400\n\nThe Supercars have been a highlight of the supporting categories in all Melbourne Grand Prix every year except 2007 since 1996. For the past few years the Australian Grand Prix Corporation has been working towards gaining championship status for the Supercars race, at the last moment the bid was dropped but the organisers have vowed to secure it in 2018. Chaz Mostert won the 2017 race with the Supercheap Auto FG X Falcon race car on Sunday 26 March.\nFerrari Challenge Asia-Pacific\n\nThe Asia-Pacific is the most recent of the Challenge series since the 2011 season, inaugurated in combination with the growing interest and sales for Ferrari in Asia. The season encompasses events in Japan, China, Malaysia and Singapore. The Asia-Pacific also features the Trofeo Pirelli and Coppa Shell class system. Grid is made up of 35 to 40 drivers for the 2012 season.\n\nMSS Security Ultimate Speed Comparison\n\nThis original event featured three different cars, the Minardi 2-seater F1 car driven by Will Davison, Peter Hackett in a Mercedes GT and Mick Doohan in a Mercedes road car compete in which car completes the lap with the greatest margin over the others. MSS Security one of Australia's largest security companies not only sponsors this race but they also provided the security personnel for the 2017 Melbourne Grand Prix.\n\nHistory\n\nAlbert Park Circuit (1953 to 1958)\n\nAlbert Park has the distinction of being the only venue to host the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats with an earlier configuration of the current circuit used for the race on two occasions during the 1950s. During this time racing was conducted in an anti-clockwise directionStuart Sykes, It was - and still is - a great place for a race, Racing into History, A look back at the 1953 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, 2013, page3 & 4 as opposed to the current circuit which runs clockwise.\n\nKnown as the Albert Park Circuit,Official Souvenir Programme, XVIIIth Australian Grand Prix, Albert Park Circuit, 21 November 1953, front cover the original 3.125 mile (5.03 kilometre) course hosted a total of six race meetings:1953, The official 50-race history of the Australian Grand Prix, 1986, pages 182 to 191\n\n* 21 November 1953 - Featuring the 1953 Australian Grand Prix, won by Doug Whiteford (Talbot-Lago T26C)\n* 26 & 27 March 1955Official Programme, Argus Moomba Motor Car Races, Albert Park Circuit, 26 & 27 March 1955, front cover - The first Moomba meeting, which involved an alliance with the Moomba festival and The Argus newspaper - featuring the Moomba TT, won by Doug Whiteford (Triumph TR2)Argus Moomba Motor Races, Australian Motor Sports, April 1955, pages 137 - 142 and the Argus Trophy, also won by Doug Whiteford (Talbot-Lago)Thrills for 250,000, The Argus, Monday, 28 March 1955, page 1\n* 11 March & 18 March 1956JR Horman, Albert Park, Australian Motor Sports, April 1956, pages 136 to 143 - The second Moomba meeting - featuring the 1956 Moomba TT, won by Tony Gaze (HWM Jaguar), and, on the second weekend, the 1956 Argus Trophy, won by Reg Hunt (Maserati 250F)\n* 25 November & 2 December 1956[http://www.progcovers.com/motor/melbourne.html Albert Park, www.progcovers.com] Retrieved on 10 July 2014 - featuring the 1956 Australian Tourist Trophy, won by Stirling Moss (Maserati 300S) and, on the second weekend, the 1956 Australian Grand Prix, also won by Stirling Moss (Maserati 250F)1956, The official 50-race history of the Australian Grand Prix, 1986, pages 218 to 226\n* 17Programme, Victorian Tourist Trophy, First Day: 17th March 1957 & 24 March 1957 - The third Moomba meeting - featuring the Victorian Tourist Trophy won by Doug Whiteford (Maserati 300S),AC Russell, Albert Park - Victorian Tourist Trophy Meeting, Australian Motors Sports, page 131 and the Victorian Trophy,Victorian Trophy, Australian Motor Sport, May 1957, pages 174 to 176 won by Lex Davison (Ferrari 500).John B Blanden, Historic Racing Cars in Australia, 1979, pages 146 & 147 The Victorian Trophy was retrospectively designated as the second round of the 1957 Australian Drivers' ChampionshipGraham Howard, Lex Davison – larger than life, page 117\n* 23 & 30 November 1958Official Programme, 1958 Melbourne Grand Prix / Victorian Tourist Trophy, Albert Park Circuit, page 3 - Featuring the 1958 Victorian Tourist Trophy, won by Doug Whiteford (Maserati 300S),David McKay, Quick money for Moss, Modern Motor, February 1959, pages 35, 36, 37 & 76 and, on the second weekend, the 1958 Melbourne Grand Prix, (a round of the 1958 Australian Drivers' Championship), won by Stirling Moss (Cooper Coventry Climax)\n\nLap records\n\nAs of 14 March 2015.",
