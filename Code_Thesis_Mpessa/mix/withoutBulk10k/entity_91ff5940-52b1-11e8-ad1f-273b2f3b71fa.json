  "textBody" : "The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also known as the American War of Independence,Modern British writers generally favor \"American War of Independence\", rather than \"American Rebellion\" or \"War of American Independence\".  was a global war that began as a conflict between Great Britain and its Thirteen Colonies which declared independence as the United States of America.\n\nAfter 1765, growing philosophical and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony. Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.The colony of Georgia joined later.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at Concord in April 1775 led to open combat. Militia forces then besieged Boston, forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army. Concurrently, an American attempt to invade Quebec and raise rebellion against the British failed decisively. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its declaration on July 4. Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive, capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at Trenton and Princeton restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an invasion from Quebec under John Burgoyne, intending to isolate the New England Colonies. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate campaign against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at Saratoga in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences; France formally allied with the Americans and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an ally of France but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the Kingdom of Mysore attacked the British in India, and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into open war. In North America, the British mounted a \"Southern strategy\" led by Charles Cornwallis which hinged upon a Loyalist uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at King's Mountain and Cowpens. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive French naval victory deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the Comte de Rochambeau and Washington then besieged Cornwallis' army and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n\nWhigs in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in North America, but the war continued in Europe and India. Britain remained under siege in Gibraltar but scored a major victory over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the Treaty of Paris in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive,Brooks, Richard (editor). Atlas of World Military History. HarperCollins, 2000, p. 101 \"Washington's success in keeping the army together deprived the British of victory, but French intervention won the war.\" but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some minor territorial gains but failed in its primary aim of recovering Gibraltar. The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede territory to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies concluded in 1784 without any territorial changes.\n\nBackground \n\nEarly seeds \n\nIn 1651, the Parliament of England sought to regulate trade in America by passing the Navigation Acts, ensuring that trade only enriched Britain.Pestana, Carla Gardina (2004). The English Atlantic in an Age of Revolution: 1640–1661. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: Harvard University Press. p. 120. The economic effects were minimal, but they triggered serious political friction.  The American colonists had fought King Philip's War without significant assistance from the Crown, and this contributed to a growing sense of American identity separate from that of Britain.Lepore (1998), The Name of War (1999) pp 5–7 Britain continued to assert control into the 1680s,Curtis P. Nettels, The Roots of American Civilization: A History of American Colonial Life (1938) p. 297. culminating in the abrogation of colonial charters, pp. 148–56, 155–57, 169–70 and the establishment of the Dominion of New England in 1686. Colonists, however, felt that the Dominion was undermining their democratic libertyLovejoy, pp. 180, 192–93, 197, pp. 169–70 and they overthrew it in 1689;, pp. 190–91, p. 201 the Crown made no attempt to restore it., p. 596, p. 430\n\nThe British government continued to pursue trade control, however, passing acts that taxed wool, hats,Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?idcrhJ5-mbDygC&pg\nPA93& Empires to Nations: Expansion in America, 1713–1824], p.93 (1974) and molasses.Draper pg. 100. The quote provided by Draper came from Leo Francis Stock’s Proceedings and Debates of the British Parliaments respecting North America (1937) vol. 4. pg. 182  The Molasses Act of 1733 was especially egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial trade relied on the product. The taxes severely damaged the local economy, and consequently they were rarely paid. Smuggling, bribery, piracy, and intimidation of customs officials became commonplace., pp. 95-e99\nColonial wars were also a contributing factor. The return of Louisbourg to France in 1748 following the War of the Austrian Succession caused considerable resentment in New England, the colonists having expended great effort in subduing the fortress only to have it returned to their erstwhile enemy.Guizot, M. A popular history of France, from the earliest times. Vol IV, University of Michigan, 2005, , p.166.\n\nTaxation disputes \n\nBritain triumphed over France and Spain in the Seven Years' War, but this led to a financial crisis, as the national debt had doubled to £130 million, and the annual cost of the British civil and military establishment in America had quintupled when compared to 1749.Debt & Taxes, John Makim & Norman Ornstein P.54 Smuggling had been tacitly accepted, but the practice decreased British revenue, so Whitehall decided to ensure that customs duties were unavoidableSpain & the Independence of the United States; An Intrinsic Gift. Thomas E, Chavez P.22 by passing the Stamp Act in 1765. Colonists condemned the tax because their rights as Englishmen protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had no elected representatives. Parliament argued that the colonies were \"represented virtually\", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire. Parliament did repeal the act in 1766; however, it also affirmed its right to pass laws that were binding on the colonies. From 1767, Parliament began passing legislation to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty while inadvertently increasing resentment among the colonists, and opposition soon became widespread.Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop Liberty in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to extradite colonists to face trial in England.Knollenberg, Growth, 69 Tensions rose after the murder of Christopher Seider by a customs official in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the Boston Massacre. In 1772, colonists in Rhode Island boarded and burned a customs schooner. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the Tea Act in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy East India Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the governor of Massachusetts permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor. So, the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests, an incident that later became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It closed Boston Harbor until the tea was paid for and revoked the Massachusetts Charter, taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/mass_gov_act.aspIan R. Christie and Benjamin W. Labaree, Empire or Independence, 1760–1776 (New York: Norton, 1976) p. 188. Further measures allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity., p. 9 Further laws allowed the governor to billet troops in private property without permission.Ammerman points out that the act only permitted soldiers to be quartered in unoccupied buildings—although they were still private property. (Ammerman, In the Common Cause, 10) The colonists referred to the measures as the \"Intolerable Acts\", and they argued that both their constitutional rights and their natural rights were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to all of America.Ammerman, In the Common Cause, 15. The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the Patriots and curtailing Loyalist sentiment.\n\nColonial response \n\nThe colonists responded by establishing the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve coloniesFerling, John. (2003). A Leap in the Dark. Oxford University Press. p. 112. convened the First Continental Congress to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal to create an American parliament to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed a compact declaring a trade boycott against Britain.Kramnick, Isaac (ed); Thomas Paine (1982). Common Sense. Penguin Classics. p. 21. The Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to trade regulations for the benefit of the empire,\"Resolved, 4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council: and as the English colonists are not represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed: But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament, as are bonfide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects, in America, without their consent.\" quoted from the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress] October 14, 1774. and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.\n\nParliament refused to yield. In 1775, it declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and enforced a blockade of the colony.Cogliano, Francis D. Revolutionary America, 1763–1815: A Political History. Routledge, 1999. pp. 47Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 47–48 It then passed legislation to limit colonial trade to the British West Indies and the British Isles. Colonial ships were barred from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a measure which pleased Canadiens but damaged New England's economy. These increasing tensions led to a mutual scramble for ordnance and pushed the colonies toward open war.Alan Axelrod, [https://books.google.com/books?idiBvtuSWgt_QC&pg\nPA83&redir_escy#v\nonepage&q&f=false The Real History of the American Revolution: A New Look at the Past], p. 83 Thomas Gage was the British Commander-in-Chief and military governor of Massachusetts, and he received orders on April 14, 1775 to disarm the local militias.Fischer, p. 76\n\nCourse of the war \n\nWar breaks out (1775–1776) \n\nOn April 18, 1775, 700 troops were sent to confiscate militia ordnance stored at Concord.Fischer, p. 85Chidsey, p. 6. This is the total size of Smith's force. Fighting broke out, forcing the regulars to conduct a fighting withdrawal to Boston. Overnight, the local militia converged on and laid siege to Boston.Ketchum, pp. 18,54 On March 25, 4,500 British reinforcements arrived with generals William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton.Ketchum, pp. 2–9 The British seized the Charlestown peninsula on June 17 after a costly frontal assault,Ketchum pp. 110–111Adams, Charles Francis, [https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric18951896jame#page/401/mode/1up \"The Battle of Bunker Hill\"], in American Historical Review (1895–1896), pp. 401–13. leading Howe to replace Gage.Higginbotham (1983), pp. 75–77. Many senior officers were dismayed at the attack, which had gained them little,Ketchum, p. 183, 198–209 while Gage wrote to London stressing the need for a large army to suppress the revolt. On July 3, George Washington took command of the Continental Army besieging Boston. Howe made no effort to attack, much to Washington's surprise.Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/449/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth CentuIry] (1882), pp. 449–50. A plan was rejected to assault the city,McCullough, p.53 and the Americans instead fortified Dorchester Heights in early March 1776 with heavy artillery captured from a raid on Fort Ticonderoga.Frothingham, pp. 100–101 The British were permitted to withdraw unmolested on March 17, and they sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Washington then moved his army to New York.\n\nMeanwhile, British officials in Quebec began lobbying Indian tribes to support them,Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 293 while the Americans urged them to maintain their neutrality.Glatthaar (2006), p. 91Glatthaar (2006), p. 93 In April 1775, Congress feared an Anglo-Indian attack from Canada and authorized an invasion of Quebec. Quebec had a largely Francophone population and had been under British rule for only 12 years, and the Americans expected that they would welcome being liberated from the British.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 242, p. 141Mark R. Anderson, The Battle for the Fourteenth Colony: America's War of Liberation in Canada, 1774–1776 (University Press of New England; 2013).

A failed counter-attack on June 8 ended American operations in Quebec.Stanley, pp. 127–128 However, the British could not conduct an aggressive pursuit because of American ships on Lake Champlain. On October 11, the British defeated the American squadron, forcing them to withdraw to Ticonderoga and ending the campaign. The invasion cost the Patriots their support in British public opinion,Watson (1960), p. 203. while aggressive anti-Loyalist policies diluted Canadien support.Arthur S. Lefkowitz, Benedict Arnold's Army: The 1775 American Invasion of Canada during the Revolutionary War (2007). The Patriots continued to view Quebec as a strategic aim, though no further attempts to invade were ever made.Smith (1907), volume 2, pp. 459–552\n\nIn Virginia, Royal governor Lord Dunmore had attempted to disarm the militia as tensions increased, although no fighting broke out.Selby and Higginbotham, p. 2 He issued a proclamation on November 7, 1775 promising freedom for slaves who fled their Patriot masters to fight for the Crown. Dunmore's troops were overwhelmed by Patriots at Great Bridge, and Dunmore fled to naval ships anchored off Norfolk. Subsequent negotiations broke down, so Dunmore ordered the ships to destroy the town.Russell, p. 73\n\nFighting broke out on November 19 in South Carolina between Loyalist and Patriot militias,McCrady, p. 89 and the Loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony., pp. 80–81 Loyalists were recruited in North Carolina to reassert colonial rule in the South, but they were decisively defeated and Loyalist sentiment was subdued., p. 33 A troop of British regulars set out to reconquer South Carolina and launched an attack on Charleston on June 28, 1776,Hibbert, C: Rebels and Redcoats, p.106 but it failed and effectively left the South in Patriot control until 1780.Kepner, F,  \"A British View of the Siege of Charleston, 1776\", The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 11, No. 1.

King George then issued a Proclamation of Rebellion on August 23, 1775, which only served to embolden the colonists in their determination to become independent.Ketchum, p.211 After a speech by the King, Parliament rejected coercive measures on the colonies by 170 votes.Maier, American Scripture, 25.

British Tories refused to compromise,Middlekauff, Glorious Cause, 168; Ferling, Leap in the Dark, 123–24. while Whigs argued that current policy would drive the colonists towards independence.Maier, American Scripture, 25 Despite opposition, the King himself began micromanaging the war effort.Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy,  The Men who Lost America: British Leadership, the American Revolution, and the Fate of the Empire (Yale UP, 2013). The Irish Parliament pledged to send troops to America, and Irish Catholics were allowed to enlist in the army for the first time. Irish Protestants favored the Americans, while Catholics favored the King.\n\nThe initial hostilities provided a sobering military lesson for the British, causing them to rethink their views on colonial military capability.Ketchum, pp. 208–209Frothingham (1903), p. 298 The weak British response gave the Patriots the advantage, and the British lost control over every colony. The army had been deliberately kept small in England since 1688 to prevent abuses of power by the King.Scheer, p. 64 Parliament secured treaties with small German states for additional troopshttp://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/hessiansotherge00lowe and sent an army of 32,000 men to America after a year, the largest that it had ever sent outside Europe at the time.\n\nIn the colonies, the success of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense had boosted public support for independence.Christie and Labaree, Empire or Independence, 270; Maier, American Scripture, 31–32.Maier, American Scripture, 33–34 On July 2, Congress voted in favor of independence with twelve affirmatives and one abstention,Boyd, Evolution, 19 issuing its declaration on July 4.Maier, American Scripture, 160–61 Washington read the declaration to his men and the citizens of New York on July 9,Fischer (2004), p. 29. invigorating the crowd to tear down a lead statue of the King and melting it to make bullets.Maier, American Scripture, 156–57 British Tories criticized the signatories for not extending the same standards of equality to slaves.\n\nPatriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived,Encyclopedia of the American Revolution Mark M.

Washington split his army to positions across the city due to poor intelligence,Fischer, pp. 89, 381 and an informal attempt to negotiate peace was rejected by the Americans.Ketchum (1973), p. 104 On August 27, Howe defeated Washington and forced him back to Brooklyn Heights. Howe restrained his subordinates from pursuit, opting to besiege Washington instead.Adams, Charles Francis, [https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric18951896jame#page/657/mode/1up \"Battle of Long Island\"], in American Historical Review (1895–1896), p. 657.\n\nWashington withdrew to Manhattan without any losses in men or ordnance.Fischer, pp. 88–102 Following the withdrawal, the Staten Island Peace Conference failed to negotiate peace, as the British delegates did not possess authorization to grant independence.Ketchum (1973), p. 117 Howe then seized control of New York on September 15, and unsuccessfully engaged the Americans the following day.Fischer, pp. 102–107 He attempted to encircle Washington, but the Americans successfully withdrew. On October 28, the British fought an indecisive action against Washington, in which Howe declined to attack Washington's army, instead concentrating his efforts upon a hill that was of no strategic value.Fischer (2004), pp. 102–11.Barnet Schecter, The battle for New York: The city at the heart of the American Revolution (2002).\n\nWashington's retreat left his forces isolated, and the British captured an American army on November 16, taking 3,000 prisoners and amounting to what one historian terms \"the most disastrous defeat of the entire war\".Ketchum p. 111, 130 Washington's army fell back four days later.Fischer, pp. 109–125 Henry Clinton then captured Newport, Rhode Island, an operation which he opposed, feeling that the 6,000 troops assigned to him could have been better employed in the pursuit of Washington., p. 2531Stedman, Charles, [https://books.google.com/books?idbmQFAAAAQAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_atb#v\nonepage&q%22Henry%20Clinton%20strongly%20urged%20that%20he%20might%22&f\nfalse The History of the Origin, Progress and Termination of the American War Volume I] (1794), p. 221.

Festivities took place in London, public support reached a peak,. and the King awarded the Order of the Bath to William Howe. The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year.Ketchum (1973), p. 191, 269 The American defeat revealed what one writer views as Washington's strategic deficiencies, such as dividing a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one, his inexperienced staff misreading the situation, and his troops fleeing in disorder when fighting began.Charles Francis Adams, \"The Battle of Long Island,\" American Historical Review Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul. 1896), pp. 650–670 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1833753 in JSTOR] In the meantime, the British entered winter quarters and were in a good place to resume campaigning.Schecter, pp. 259–263\n\nOn December 25, 1776, Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware River, and his army overwhelmed the Hessian garrison at Trenton, New Jersey the following morning, taking 900 prisoners.Fischer p. 254.

Burgoyne's plan was to establish control of the Champlain-George-Hudson route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England.Ketchum (1997), p. 84 Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance. Howe instead argued capturing Philadelphia and defeating Washington was a priority.Ketchum, Saratoga (1999), p. 81 Germain approved this plan, leaving Howe unable to assist Burgoyne.Martin, p. 11-15 Washington himself was baffled by Howe's choices.John E. Ferling, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington (2010) p. Alden argues Howe was influenced by the idea that, upon success, he would not receive credit, but Burgoyne.Alden, The American Revolution (1954) p. 118 Controversy persists over whether Germain approved Burgoyne's plan after reading Howe's, and whether he shared this information with his subordinates.Samuel B. Griffith, The War for American Independence: From 1760 to the Surrender at Yorktown in 1781 Howe was not given any explicit orders to assist Burgoyne; however, a copy Germain sent to Quebec explicitly stated Howe was to assist Burgoyne's efforts.Martin, p. 11Fisher, Sydney George.

Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, quickly capturing Ticonderoga on July 5. The hasty withdrawal of the Continental Army after little resistance outraged the American public.Pancake (1977), p.125 Burgoyne's pursuit ran into stiff resistance at Hubbardton and Fort Anne. Leaving 1,300 men behind as a garrison, Burgoyne continued the advance.Nickerson (1967), pp. 146–157, 438 Progress was slow; the Americans blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams and denuded the area of food.Ketchum (1997), p. 244-249 Meanwhile, Barry St. Ledger's diversionary column laid siege to Fort Stanwix. St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his Indian support abandoned him.Pancake (1977), p. 145Nickerson (1967), pp. 271–275 On August 16, a British foraging expedition was soundly defeated at Bennington, and more than 700 troops were captured. As a result of the defeat, the vast majority of Burgoyne's Indian support abandoned him.Ketchum (1997), pp. 285–323. Meanwhile, Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned, and would be unable to render aid.Ketchum (1997), p. 283\n\nHaving considered his options, Burgoyne decided to continue the advance.Nickerson (1967), pp. 296. On September 19, he attempted to flank the American position, and clashed at Freeman's Farm. The British won, but at the cost of 600 casualties. Burgoyne then dug in, but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters, and critical supplies were running low.Ketchum (1997), pp. 337–378. Henry Clinton did capture two key forts on October 6 to divert American resources, though he turned back ten days later.Nickerson (1967), pp. 343–405. Meanwhile, the American army was growing in size daily,Nickerson (1967), pp. 327. swelling to some 15,000 men. pp. 249. On October 7, a British reconnaissance in force against the American lines was repulsed with heavy losses. Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit, and by October 13, he was surrounded. With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17, and 6,222 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans.Ketchum (1997), pp. 403–425. The decisive success spurred France to enter the war as an ally of the United States, securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain, that of foreign assistance.Edmund Morgan, The Birth of the Republic: 1763–1789 (1956) pp 82–83Higginbotham (1983), pp. 188–98\n\nMeanwhile, Howe launched his campaign against Washington, though his initial efforts to bring him to battle in June 1777 failed.Stedman, Charles, [https://books.google.com/books?idbmQFAAAAQAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_atb#v\nonepage&q&ffalse The History of the Origin, Progress and Termination of the American War Volume I] (1794), pp. 287–89. Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via New Jersey, or by sea via the Delaware Bay, even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary. Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne. This decision was so difficult to understand, Howe's critics accused him of treason.Adams, Charles Francis.

On December 19, Washington's army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge. Poor conditions and supply problems resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 troops.Freedman, 2008, p. 1-30 Howe, only 20 miles (32 km) away, made no effort to attack, which critics observed could have ended the war.Noel Fairchild Busch, Winter Quarters: George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge (Liveright, 1974).[https://web.archive.org/web/20120619002020/http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/risch/chpt-14.htm \"A Concluding Commentary\"] Supplying Washington's Army (1981).[http://history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch04.htm \"The Winning of Independence, 1777–1783\"] American Military History Volume I (2005).\n\nThe Continental Army was put through a new training program, supervised by Baron von Steuben, introducing the most modern Prussian methods of drilling.Paul Douglas Lockhart, The Drillmaster of Valley Forge: The Baron de Steuben and the Making of the American Army (2008). Meanwhile, Howe resigned and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778. Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France's entry into the war. On June 18, the British departed Philadelphia, with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit.Text incorporated from [http://www.nps.gov/vafo Valley Forge National Historical Park] website, which is in the public domain. The two armies fought at Monmouth Court House on June 28, with the Americans holding the field, greatly boosting morale and confidence.Freedman, 2008, p. 70-83 By July, both armies were back in the same positions they had been two years prior.\n\nForeign intervention \n\nThe defeat at Saratoga caused considerable anxiety in Britain over foreign intervention. The North ministry sought reconciliation with the colonies by consenting to their original demands,Reid, Authority to Tax, 51. although Lord North refused to grant independence.Stockley (2001), p. 11-12 No positive reply was received from the Americans.\n\nFrench foreign minister the Comte de Vergennes was strongly anti-British, and he sought a casus belli to go to war with Britain following the conquest of Canada in 1763.Hoffman, Ronald, and Peter J. Albert, eds. Diplomacy and Revolution: The Franco-American Alliance of 1778 (United States Capitol Historical Society, 1981) The French had covertly supplied the Americans through neutral Dutch ports since the onset of the war, proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign.\"Journal of the American Revolution, The Gunpowder shortage (September 9, 2013).[http://allthingsliberty.com/2013/09/the-gunpowder-shortage/]James Brown Scott, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?iduc1.32106006332446;view\n1up;seq37 Historical Introduction], p.8–9 in Samuel Flagg Bemis, Ed. The American Secretaries of State and their diplomacy  V.1–2, 1963. The French public favored war, though Vergennes and King Louis XVI were hesitant, owing to the military and financial risk. The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile, but doing so also brought major concerns. The King was concerned that Britain's concessions would be accepted, and that she would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the Caribbean.Perkins, James Breck, [http://www.americanrevolution.org/frconfiles/fr12.html France In The Revolution] (1911).Corwin, Edward Samuel, [https://archive.org/stream/frenchpolicyamer00corwuoft#page/121/mode/1up French Policy and the American Alliance] (1916), pp. 121–48. To prevent this, France formally recognized the United States on February 6, 1778 and followed with a military alliance. France aimed to expel Britain from the Newfoundland fishery, end restrictions on Dunkirk sovereignty, regain free trade in India, recover Senegal and Dominica, and restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions pertaining to Anglo-French trade., p. 15, p. 290\n\nSpain was wary of provoking war with Britain before she was ready, so she covertly supplied the Patriots via her colonies in New Spain., p. 87, p. 99 Congress hoped to persuade Spain into an open alliance, so the first American Commission met with the Count of Aranda in 1776. Spain was still reluctant to make an early commitment, owing to a lack of direct French involvement, the threat against their treasure fleets, and the possibility of war with Portugal, Spain's neighbor and a close ally of Britain., p. 1:408 However, Spain affirmed its desire to support the Americans the following year, hoping to weaken Britain's empire., p. 4  In the Spanish-Portuguese War (1776-77), the Portuguese threat was neutralized. On 12 April 1779, Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez with France and went to war against Britain.Clarfield, Gerard. United States Diplomatic History: From Revolution to Empire. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1992. Spain sought to recover Gibraltar and Menorca in Europe, as well as Mobile and Pensacola in Florida, and also to expel the British from Central America., p. 19, p. 9\n\nMeanwhile, George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight. He did not welcome war with France, but he believed that Britain had made all necessary steps to avoid it and cited the British victories over France in the Seven Years' War as a reason to remain optimistic.Syrett (1998), p. 17 Britain tried in vain to find a powerful ally to engage France, leaving it isolated,, p. 264-72 preventing Britain from focusing the majority of her efforts in one theater,Cf., Richard Pares, (1936): 429–65, p. 18 and forcing a major diversion of military resources from America.Ketchum (1997), p. 405–448Higginbotham (1983), pp. 175–88 Despite this, the King determined never to recognize American independence and to ravage the colonies indefinitely, or until they pleaded to return to the yoke of the Crown.Trevelyan (1912), vol. 1, p. 4., p. 5. Mahan argues that Britain's attempt to fight in multiple theaters simultaneously without major allies was fundamentally flawed, citing impossible mutual support, exposing the forces to defeat in detail.Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783 (Boston:Little, Brown, 1890), p. 534\n\nSince the outbreak of the conflict, Britain had appealed to her ally, the neutral Dutch Republic, to loan her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America, but pro-American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request. Consequently, the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support, but the Republic still refused. Moreover, American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their West Indies colonies. French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports. The Republic maintained free trade with France following France's declaration of war on Britain, citing a prior concession by Britain on this issue. Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping, and even firing upon it. Consequently, the Republic joined the First League of Armed Neutrality to enforce their neutral status. The Republic had also given sanctuary to American privateers and had drafted a treaty of commerce with the Americans. Britain argued that these actions contravened the Republic's neutral stance and declared war in December 1780.\n\nInternational war breaks out (1778–1780) \n\nEurope \n\nSoon after France declared war, French and British fleets fought an indecisive action off Ushant on 27 July 1778., p. 412 Spain entered the war on 12 April 1779, with a primary goal of capturing Gibraltar,, p. 9 Spanish troops under the Duc de Crillon laid siege to the Rock on 24 June., p. 385-87 The naval  blockade, however, was relatively weak, and the British were able to resupply the garrison., p. 37 Meanwhile, a plan was formulated for a combined Franco-Spanish invasion of the British mainland, but the expedition failed due to a combination of poor planning, disease, logistical issues, and high financial expenditures.., p. 3 However, a diversionary Franco-American squadron did meet with some success on 23 September under John Paul Jones. On 16 January 1780, the Royal Navy under George Rodney scored a major victory over the Spanish, weakening the naval blockade of Gibraltar.\n\nA Franco-Spanish fleet commanded by Luis de Córdova intercepted and decisively defeated a large British convoy off the Azores led by John Moutray on 9 August which was bound for the West Indies.Volo, M.

In early 1780, he mounted an expedition to take Mobile, setting off with 750 troops on 11 January and joined by reinforcements from Havana. They commenced siege operations on March 1, and the town fell after a 14-day siege., p. 255 Gálvez had hoped to push on to Pensacola, the British capital of West Florida; however, a hurricane devastated his expedition, stalling it till 1781., p. 36\n\nIn Central America, the defense of Guatemala was a priority for Spain. The British intended to capture the key fortress of San Fernando de Omoa and drive the Spanish from the region., p. 151 After inadequate first attempts, 1,200 British troops led by William Dalrymple arrived on 16 October, and they captured the fort on 20 October.Chávez, p. 152 However, the British suffered terribly due to disease and were forced to abandon the fort on 29 November;Chávez, p. 153 Spanish troops subsequently reoccupied it.Chávez, p. 158 In 1780, Jamaica's governor John Dalling planned an expedition to cut New Spain in two by capturing Granada, which would subsequently allow them full control of the San Juan River., p. 9 A British expedition set out on 3 February 1780, led by John Polson and Horatio Nelson.Southey p.10 They reached Fort San Juan on 17 March and laid siege, capturing it on 29 April., p. 73 The British were ravaged by disease, p. 32 and were running low on food due to poor logistics. They withdrew on 8 November, the expedition having suffered a decisive defeat;, p. 307 some 2,500 troops had perished, making it the costliest British disaster of the war., p. 173\n\nIndia \n\nThe British East India Company moved quickly to capture French possessions in India when they learned about the hostilities with France, and they took Pondicherry on 19 October 1778 after a two-week siege., p. 23-25 The Company resolved to drive the French completely out of India,, p. 79 and they captured the Malabar port of Mahé in 1779 where French ordnance passed through.\n\nMahé was under the protection of Mysore's ruler Hyder Ali (the Tipu Sultan), and tensions were already inflamed because the British had supported Malabar rebels who had risen against him;, p.56 so the fall of Mahé precipitated war.Cust, Eduard. (1862). \"Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century, Compiled from the Most Authentic Histories of the Period\" Volume 3, University of Lausanne., p. 222 Hyder Ali invaded the Carnatic region in July 1780 and laid siege to Tellicherry and Arcot. A British relief force of 7,000 men under William Baille was intercepted and destroyed by the Tipu Sultan on 10 September, the worst defeat suffered by a European army in India at the time.Ramaswami, N.S. (1984). Political History of Carnatic under the Nawabs. New Delhi: Abhinav Publications. p. 225\n\nAli then renewed the siege at Arcot instead of pressing on for a decisive victory against a second British army at Madras, capturing it on 3 November. The delay allowed British forces to regroup for campaigning the following year.Barua, p. 80\n\nStalemate in the North (1778–1780) \n\nHenry Clinton withdrew from Philadelphia, consolidating his forces in New York following the British defeat at Saratoga and the entry of France into the war. French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to North America in April 1778 to assist Washington, and he arrived shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York.Morrissey, p. 77 The Franco-American forces felt that New York's defenses were too formidable for the French fleet,, pp.174–175 and they opted to attack Newport.Morrissey, p. 78 This effort was launched on August 29, but it failed when the French opted to withdraw, and this displeased the Americans., p.102-106 The war then ground down to a stalemate, with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes, such as those at Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor. In the summer of 1779, the Americans captured British posts at Stony Point and Paulus Hook.\n\nIn July, Clinton unsuccessfully attempted to coax Washington into a decisive engagement by making a major raid into Connecticut., p. 170 That month, a large American naval operation attempted to retake Maine, but it resulted in the worst American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941., p. 149 The high frequency of Iroquois raids on the locals compelled Washington to mount a punitive expedition which destroyed a large number of Iroquois settlements, but the effort ultimately failed to stop the raids. During the winter of 1779–80, the Continental Army suffered greater hardships than at Valley Forge.Tolson, Jay (July 7–14, 2008). How Washington's Savvy Won the Day. U.S. News & World Report. Morale was poor; public support was being eroded by the long war; the national currency was virtually worthless; the army was plagued with supply problems; desertion was common; and whole regiments mutinied over the conditions in early 1780.Ketchum, pp. 8,12\n\nIn 1780, Clinton launched an attempt to retake New Jersey. On June 7, 6,000 men invaded under Hessian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen, but they met stiff resistance from the local militia. The British held the field, but Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington's main army and withdrew., p. 174-175 Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt two weeks later which was soundly defeated at Springfield, effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey.Fleming, p. 232, 302 Meanwhile, American general Benedict Arnold had defected to the British, and he conspired to betray the key American fortress of West Point by surrendering it to the enemy. The plot was foiled when British spy master John André was captured, so Arnold fled to British lines in New York. He attempted to justify his betrayal by appealing to Loyalist public opinion, but the Patriots strongly condemned him as a coward and turncoat.Willard M. Wallace, Traitorous Hero: The Life and Fortunes of Benedict Arnold (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1954), p. 263, 270\n\nThe war to the west of the Appalachians was largely confined to skirmishing and raids. An expedition of militia was halted due to adverse weather in February 1778 which had set out to destroy British military supplies in settlements along the Cuyahoga River.Downes, Council Fires, 211; Nester, Frontier War, 194; Nelson, Man of Distinction, 101. Later in the year, a second campaign was undertaken to seize the Illinois Country from the British. The Americans captured Kaskaskia on July 4 and then secured Vincennes, although Vincennes was recaptured by Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit. In early 1779, the Americans counterattacked by undertaking a risky winter march, and they secured the surrender of the British at Vincennes, taking Hamilton prisoner.James, James Alton, ed. George Rogers Clark Papers. 2 vols. Originally published 1912–1926. Reprinted New York: AMS Press, 1972. , p. 144-48Lowell Hayes Harrison, George Rogers Clark and the War in the West (2001).\n\nOn May 25, 1780, the British launched an expedition into Kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the Gulf coast. The expedition met with only limited success, though hundreds of settlers were killed or captured.Grenier, John. The First Way of War: American War Making on the Frontier, 1607–1814. Cambridge University Press, 2005. ., p. 159. Grenier argues that \"The slaughter the Indians and rangers perpetrated was unprecedented.\" The Americans responded with a major offensive along the Mad River in August which met with some success, but it did little to abate the Indian raids on the frontier.Nelson, Larry L.

(hardcover). p. 118 French militia attempted to capture Detroit, but it ended in disaster when Miami Indians ambushed and defeated the gathered troops on November 5.

A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco-Spanish fleets.Henry Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).\n\nOn April 19, 1778, three row galleys of the Georgia Navy engaged, defeated, and captured a Royal Navy brigantine, an armed British East Florida provincial sloop, and an armed brig.\n\nOn December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from New York captured Savannah, and British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support., p. 46-47 There was a promising initial turnout in early 1779, but then a large Loyalist militia was defeated at Kettle Creek on February 14 and they had to recognize their dependence upon the British. The British, however, defeated Patriot militia at Brier Creek on March 3,Morrill (1993), p. 48-50 and then launched an abortive assault on Charleston, South Carolina. The operation became notorious for its high degree of looting by British troops, enraging both Loyalists and Patriot colonists., p. 112\n\nIn October, a combined Franco-American effort failed to recapture Savannah.Hibbert, C.; Rebels and Redcoats; p. 246 In 1780, Henry Clinton moved against Charleston, capturing it on May 12. With few losses of their own, the British took 5,266 prisoners,[http://www.carolana.com/SC/Revolution/revolution_siege_of_charleston.html], The American Revolution in South Carolina effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south.John W.

In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias who effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in Fairfield County,Shelton, Kenneth, All That Dare Oppose Them: The Whig Victory at Mobley's Meeting House, June 1780, (2005) Lincolnton, York County,Michael C.

Stonestreet IV, The Battle of Colson's Mill: Death Knell of the Carolina Tories, (Createspace Publishing, 2014) pp.67–70.  and Lancaster County.\n\nCongress appointed Horatio Gates, victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. He suffered a major defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.Hugh F. Rankin, North Carolina in the American Revolution (1996). The British attempted to subjugate the countryside, and Patriot militia continued to fight against them, so Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north., p. 202 This wing of Cornwallis' army was virtually destroyed on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas. Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina.Buchanan, p. 241 In the interim, Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate, Nathanael Greene.Buchanan, p. 275\n\nGreene was unable to confront the British directly, so he dispatched a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops.Buchanan, p. 292 Morgan then defeated the cream of the British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781 at Cowpens.Buchanan, p. 326 Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support,Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion; 1783 but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted war of attrition.\n\nBy March, Greene's army had increased in size enough that he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15; Greene was beaten, but Cornwallis' army suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining than the British had previously expected.Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000). Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement, leaving the Patriots in control of the interior of the Carolinas and Georgia.\n\nGreene then proceeded to reclaim the South.

A British force clashed with American troops at Eutaw Springs on September 8 in a final effort to stop Greene, but the British casualties were so high that they withdrew to Charleston., p. 221 Minor skirmishes continued in the Carolinas until the end of the war, and British troops were effectively confined to Charleston and Savannah for the remainder of the conflict.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats: The American Revolutionary War, London, 2003\n\nBritish defeat in America (1781) \n\nCornwallis had discovered that the majority of American supplies in the Carolinas were passing through Virginia, and he had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade. Cornwallis believed that a successful campaign there would cut supplies to Greene's army and precipitate a collapse of American resistance in the South. Clinton strongly opposed the plan, favoring a campaign farther north in the Chesapeake Bay region.Cornwallis; An Answer to Sir Henry Clinton's Narrative. Note: Cornwallis wrote this pamphlet shortly after the war in explanation of his actions. Lord Germain wrote to Cornwallis to approve his plan and neglected to include Clinton in the decision-making, even though Clinton was Cornwallis' superior officer,Cornwallis Correspondence, [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/default.htm Public Record Office] and Cornwallis then decided to move into Virginia without informing Clinton.Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy which followed the surrender at Yorktown.

Washington pushed for an attack on New York, while Rochambeau preferred a strike in Virginia where the British were less well-established and thus easier to defeat.Ketchum, p. 139 Franco-American movements around New York caused Clinton a great deal of anxiety, fearing an attack on the city. His instructions were vague to Cornwallis during this time, rarely forming explicit orders. However, Clinton did instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base and to transfer troops to the north to defend New York.Grainger, p. 43-44 Cornwallis dug in at Yorktown and awaited the Royal Navy.Michael Cecere, Great Things are Expected from the Virginians: Virginia in the American Revolution (2009).\n\nWashington still favored an assault on New York, but he acquiesced to the French when they opted to send their fleet to their preferred target of Yorktown. In August, the combined Franco-American army moved south to coordinate with de Grasse in defeating Cornwallis., p. 101 The British lacked sufficient naval resources to effectively counter the French, but they dispatched a fleet under Thomas Graves to assist Cornwallis and attempt to gain naval dominance. On September 5, the French fleet decisively defeated Graves, giving the French control of the seas around Yorktown and cutting off Cornwallis from reinforcements and relief., p. 110 Despite the continued urging of his subordinates,Ketchum, p. 205\n\nCornwallis made no attempt to break out and engage the Franco-American army before it had established siege works, expecting that reinforcements would arrive from New York,, p. 362 and the Franco-American army laid siege to Yorktown on September 28.Ketchum, p. 214 Cornwallis continued to think that relief was imminent from Clinton, and he abandoned his outer defenses which were immediately occupied by American troops—serving to hasten his subsequent defeat., p. 337 The British then failed in an attempt to break out of the siege across the river at Gloucester Point when a storm hit., p. 237 Cornwallis and his subordinates were under increasing bombardment and facing dwindling supplies; they agreed that their situation was untenable and negotiated a surrender on October 17, 1781,, p. 16 and 7,685 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans.Greene, pp. 307–308 The same day as the surrender, 6,000 troops under Clinton had departed New York, sailing to relieve Yorktown.Ketchum, p. 241Richard Ferrie, The World Turned Upside Down: George Washington and the Battle of Yorktown (1999).\n\nNorth Ministry collapses \n\nThe North government had gained support in Parliament after the British successes at Newport and Charleston,Rodger, N.A.M. Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815, (2007), p. 343 but the decision to allow Irish Catholics to enlist in the army was deeply unpopular and triggered a massive protest in London in 1780, culminating in widespread rioting. The riots were the most destructive in London's history, damaging the prestige of the government.http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-gordon-riots-of-1780-london-in-flames-a-nation-in-ruinsRogers p.152 On 25 November 1781, the situation worsened when news arrived in London of the surrender at Yorktown.

While peace negotiations were being undertaken, British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives. Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace, as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt, and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there. He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire, though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778. Negotiations soon began in Paris.\n\nThe Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as spoils of war,Rideau, Roger. A Brief History of Canada.

The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the area north of the Ohio River, below which an Indian barrier state would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" Northwest Ohio Quarterly 61#2–4 (1989): 46–63.\n\nThe Americans skirted their allies, recognizing that more favorable terms would be found in London. They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782–1783: Vision and Reality.\" International History Review 5#3 (1983): 322–345.

As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as smallpox claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a smallpox epidemic broke out throughout North America, killing 40 people in Boston alone. Historian Joseph Ellis suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops inoculated against the disease was one of his most important decisions.Ellis (2004), p. 87.\n\nBetween 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service.Howard H. Peckham, ed., The Toll of Independence: Engagements and Battle Casualties of the American Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974). Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the British, mostly in the prison ships in New York Harbor. If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the American Civil War. Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone. The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.American dead and wounded: Shy, pp. 249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p. 849.\n\nThe French suffered approximately 7,000 total dead throughout the conflict; of those, 2,112 were killed in combat in the American theaters of war.\n\nThe Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.\n\nBritish and allies \n\nBritish returns in 1783 listed 43,633 rank and file deaths across the British Armed Forces.[https://books.google.com/books?id\np7T9O3aNmVoC&pgPA199&dq\nAnnual+register+43,633&hlen&sa\nX&eiHmfKVOSMGKrIsATz14K4DQ&ved\n0CB8Q6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nAnnual%20register%2043%2C633&ffalse Annual Register, 1783] (1785), pp. 199–200.

Extrapolations based upon this list puts British Army losses in the area of at least 4,000 killed or died of wounds. Approximately 7,774 Germans died in British service in addition to 4,888 deserters; of the former, it is estimated 1,800 were killed in combat.\n\nAround 171,000 sailors served in the Royal Navy during the war; approximately a quarter of whom had been pressed into service.

The Mariner's Mirror. 94: 160–175. Around 42,000 sailors deserted during the war.Mackesy (1964), pp. 6, 176 (British seamen). The impact on merchant shipping was substantial; an estimated 3,386 merchant ships were seized by enemy forces during the war;Conway (1995) p. 191 of those, 2,283 were taken by American privateers alone.\n\nFinancial debts \n\nAt the start of the war, the economy of the colonies was flourishing,Marston, Daniel. The American Revolution 1774–1783. Osprey Publishing (2002) . p. 82 and the free white population enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world. The Royal Navy enforced a naval blockade during the war to financially cripple the colonies, however, this proved unsuccessful; 90% of the population worked in farming, not in coastal trade, and, as such, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade.Greene and Pole, eds., A Companion to the American Revolution (2004) chapters 42, 48\n\nCongress had immense difficulties throughout the conflict to efficiently finance the war effort.Curtis P. Nettels, The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815 (1962) pp 23–44 As the circulation of hard currency declined, the Americans had to rely on loans from American merchants and bankers, France, Spain and the Netherlands, saddling the young nation with crippling debts. Congress attempted to remedy this by printing vast amounts of paper money and bills of credit to raise revenue. The effect was disastrous; inflation skyrocketed, and the paper money became virtually worthless. The inflation spawned a popular phrase that anything of little value was \"not worth a continental\".\"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx Not worth a continental] \", \"Creating the United States\", Library of Congress. Retrieved 14 January 2012.\n\nBy 1791, the United States had accumulated a national debt of approximately $75.5 million.Trescott, Paul. \"Federal-State Financial Relations, 1790–1860\". 15: 227–45. The United States finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s, when Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton secured legislation by which the national government assumed all of the state debts, and, in addition, created a national bank and a funding system based on tariffs and bond issues that paid off the foreign debts.\n\nBritain spent around £80 million and ended with a national debt of £250 million, (£ in today's money), generating a yearly interest of £9.5 million annually. The debts piled upon that which it had already accumulated from the Seven Years' War. Due to wartime taxation upon the British populace, the tax for the average Briton amounted to approximately four shillings in every pound.Conway, Stephen. The War of American Independence 1775–1783. Publisher: E. Arnold (1995) . 280 pages.\n\nThe French spent approximately 1.3 billion livres on aiding the Americans, accumulating a national debt of 3.315.1 billion livres by 1783 on war costs.Conway (1995) p. 242 Unlike Britain, which had a very efficient taxation system,Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1987) p. 81, 119 the French tax system was highly unstable, eventually leading to a financial crisis in 1786.Marston (2002) p. 82 The debts contributed to a worsening fiscal crisis that ultimately begat the French Revolution at the end of the century.Tombs (2007) p. 179 The debt continued to spiral; on the eve of the French Revolution, the national debt had skyrocketed to 12 billion livres.\n\nSpain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million reales in 1778 to over 700 million in 1779.Lynch, John. Bourbon Spain 1700–1808. Publisher: Oxford (1989) . p. 326 Spain more easily disposed of her debts unlike her French ally, partially due to the massive increase in silver mining in her American colonies; production increased approximately 600% in Mexico, and by 250% in Peru and Bolivia.Castillero Calvo, Alfredo (2004). Las Rutas de la Plata: La Primera Globalización. Madrid: Ediciones San Marcos. ., p. 193\n\nAnalysis of combatants \n\nGreat Britain \n\nThe population of Great Britain and Ireland in 1780 was approximately 12.6 million,Mulhall, Michael G., [https://archive.org/stream/mulhallsdiction00unkngoog#page/n390/mode/1up Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistics] (1884), p. 357. while the Thirteen Colonies held a population of some 2.8 million, including some 500,000 slaves.[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/CT1970p2-13.pdf Colonial and Pre-Federal Statistics] U.S. Census Bureau. Theoretically, Britain had the advantage, however, many factors inhibited the procurement of a large army.\n\nArmed Forces \n\nRecruitment \n\nIn 1775, the standing British Army, exclusive of militia, comprised 45,123 men worldwide, made up of 38,254 infantry and 6,869 cavalry. The Army had approximately eighteen regiments of foot, some 8,500 men, stationed in North America.Clode, Charles Matthew (1869), \"The Military Forces of the Crown: Their Administration and Government\", London, J Murray, p. 268. Note: Figures include the 41st regiment of invalids, but not the 20 independent companies on garrison duty. Troops in India were under the control of the East India Company, and did not become part of the British Army until 1858. Standing armies had played a key role in the purge of the Long Parliament in 1648, the maintenance of a military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell, and the overthrow of James II,Rodger, N.A.M (2004). The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815. Penguin Group. , p. 137 and, as such, the Army had been deliberately kept small in peacetime to prevent abuses of power by the King. Despite this, eighteenth century armies were not easy guests, and were regarded with scorn and contempt by the press and public of the New and Old World alike, derided as enemies of liberty. An expression ran in the Navy; \"A messmate before a shipmate, a shipmate before a stranger, a stranger before a dog, a dog before a soldier\".Belcher, Henry (1911), \"The First American Civil War; First Period, 1775–1778, with chapters on the Continental or Revolutionary army and on the forces of the Crown\", Volume 1, London Macmillan, p. 250, 258\n\nParliament suffered chronic difficulties in obtaining sufficient manpower,War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:992–1008, passim and found it impossible to fill the quotas they had set.War Officer Papers, 4:275, Jenkinson to Clinton, 5 Dec. 1780 The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A Private infantryman was paid a wage of just 8d. per day,9th Report on Public Accounts (1783) in 39 House of Commons Journal, H.M. Stationery Office, 1803, pp. 325–344 the same pay as for a New Model Army infantryman, 130 years earlier.Plant, David, \"The New Model Army\", BCW Project, http://bcw-project.org/military/new-model-army, Retrieved 9 June 2017 The rate of pay in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits,Fortescue, Volume III, p. 41 as service was nominally for life.Owen, Captain Wheeler (1914), \"The War Office Past and Present\", Methuen & Co. London, p. 90\n\nTo entice people to enrol, Parliament offered a bounty of £1.10s for every recruit.War Office Papers, 3:5, Harvey to Elliot, 10 March 1775 As the war dragged on, Parliament became desperate for manpower; criminals were offered military service to escape legal penalties, and deserters were pardoned if they re-joined their units.Clode, Volume II, p.13-14 After the defeat at Saratoga, Parliament doubled the bounty to £3,Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition (London, 1763–1800), Volume XIII, p. 273-280 and increased it again the following year, to £3.3s, as well as expanding the age limit from 17–45 to 16–50 years of age.Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition, Volume XIII, p. 316-317\n\nImpressment, essentially conscription by the \"press gang\", was a favored recruiting method, though it was unpopular with the public, leading many to enlist in local militias to avoid regular service.War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to John Livesey and E. Brewer, 13 Apr. 1779 Attempts were made to draft such levies, much to the chagrin of the militia commanders.War Office Papers, 1:996, Sir William Codrington to Barrington, December 1778 Competition between naval and army press gangs, and even between rival ships or regiments, frequently resulted in brawls between the gangs in order to secure recruits for their unit.War Office Papers. 1:998, Lieutenant General Parker to Barrington, 19 June 1778. Men would maim themselves to avoid the press gangs,War Office Papers, 1:1005, Oughton to Jenkinson, 27 May 1779 while many deserted at the first opportunity.Andrews, Charles McLean (1912), \"Guide to the materials for American history, to 1783, in the Public record office of Great Britain\", Washington, D.C., Carnegie institution of Washington, Volume II, p. 32 Pressed men were militarily unreliable; regiments with large numbers of such men were deployed to garrisons such as Gibraltar or the West Indies, purely to increase the difficulty in successfully deserting.War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to Amherst, 26 Oct. 1779\n\nBy 1781, the Army numbered approximately 121,000 men globally, 48,000 of whom were stationed throughout the Americas. Of the 171,000 sailors who served in the Royal Navy throughout the conflict, around a quarter were pressed. Interestingly, this same proportion, approximately 42,000 men, deserted during the conflict.Mackesy (1964), pp. 6, 176 (British seamen) At its height, the Navy had 94 ships-of-the-line,Jonathan Dull, A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution (Yale University Press, 1985), p. 110. 104 frigatesWinfield, Rif, British Warships in the Age of Sail: 1714–1792 (Seaforth Publishing, 2007)  and 37 sloopsWinfield, Rif, British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714–1792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates (Seaforth Publishing, 2007) in service.\n\nLoyalists and Hessians \n\nIn 1775, Britain unsuccessfully attempted to secure 20,000 mercenaries from Russia,Colonial Office Papers. Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:92, Dartmouth to Howe, 5 Sept. 1775 and the use of the Scots Brigade from the Dutch Republic,Edler 2001, pp. 28–32 such was the shortage of manpower. Parliament managed to negotiate treaties with the princes of German states for large sums of money, in exchange for mercenary troops. In total, 29,875 troops were hired for British service from six German states; Brunswick (5,723), Hesse-Kassel (16,992), Hesse-Hannau (2,422), Ansbach-Bayreuth (2,353), Waldeck-Pyrmont (1,225) and Anhalt-Zerbst (1,160).Lowell, Edward J (1884), \"The Hessians and the other German Auxiliaries of Great Britain in the Revolutionary War\", Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, Chapter II King George III, who also ruled Hanover as a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire, was approached by Parliament to loan the government Hanoverian soldiers for service in the war. Hanover supplied 2,365 men in five battalions, however, the lease agreement permitted them to only be used in Europe.Knesebeck, Ernst von dem (1845), \"Geschichte de churhannoverschen Truppen in Gibraltar, Menorca und Ostindien\", Published by Im Verlage der Helwingschen Hof-Buchhandlung. Note: The strength of a Hanoverian battalion is listed as 473 men\n\nWithout any major allies, the manpower shortage became critical when France and Spain entered the war, forcing a major diversion of military resources from the Americas. Recruiting adequate numbers of Loyalist militia in America proved difficult due to high Patriot activity.Black (2001), p. 59. On militia see Boatner (1974), p. 707, and Weigley (1973), ch. 2. To bolster numbers, the British promised freedom and grants of land to slaves who fought for them. Approximately 25,000 Loyalists fought for the British throughout the war,Savas and Dameron (2006), p. xli and provided some of the best troops in the British service;Buchanan, 327 the British Legion, a mixed regiment of 250 dragoons and 200 infantryBabits, page 46, \"British Legion Infantry strength at Cowpens was between 200 and 271 enlisted men\". However, this statement is referenced to a note on pages 175–176, which says, \"The British Legion infantry at Cowpens is usually considered to have had about 200–250 men, but returns for the 25 December 1780 muster show only 175. Totals obtained by Cornwallis, dated 15 January, show that the whole legion had 451 men, but approximately 250 were dragoons\". There would therefore appear to be no evidence for putting the total strength of the five British Legion Light Infantry companies at more than 200. commanded by Banastre Tarleton, gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies, especially in the South.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23517100?loginSuccesstrue&seq\n1#page_scan_tab_contents Review by: Hugh F. Rankin; Reviewed Work: The Green Dragoon: The Lives of Banastre Tarleton and Mary Robinson by Robert D. Bass, The North Carolina Historical Review, Vol. 34, No. 4 (October, 1957), pp. 548–550]\n\nLeadership \n\nBritain had a difficult time appointing a determined senior military leadership in America. Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, due to unwillingness to take sides in the war.Ketchum (1997), p. 76 Admiral Augustus Keppel similarly opposed a command, stating; \"I cannot draw the sword in such a cause\". The Earl of Effingham resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.Ketchum (1997), p. 77\n\nAs was the case in many European armies, except the Prussian Army, officers in British service could purchase commissions to ascend the ranks.Duffy, Christopher. The Military Experience in the Age of Reason. p. 61. . Despite repeated attempts by Parliament to suppress it, the practise was common in the Army.Forteseue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 34 Values of commissions varied, but were usually in line with social and military prestige, for example, regiments such as the Guards commanded the highest prices. The lower ranks often regarded the treatment to high-ranking commissions by wealthier officers as \"plums for [their] consumption\".Belcher, Volume I, p. 270 Wealthy individuals lacking any formal military education, or practical experience, often found their way into positions of high responsibility, diluting the effectiveness of a regiment. Though Royal authority had forbade the practise since 1711, it was still permitted for infants to hold commissions. Young boys, often orphans of deceased wealthy officers, were taken from their schooling and placed in positions of responsibility within regiments.Duncan, Volume II, p. 15\n\nLogistics \n\nLogistical organization of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps existed in the modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire.Duncan, Francis (1879). \"History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery\", Volume 1. J. Murray, p. 131, 303, 309 No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who followed the army.Sergeant Lamb, \"Journal of the American War\", p. 75 Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.Duncan, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Volume 2, p. 15\n\nThe heavy personal equipment and wool uniform of the regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement.Burgoyne, State of the Expedition, p. 148 During the Battle of Monmouth in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°F (37.8°C) and is said to have claimed more lives through heat stroke than through actual combat. The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the Land Pattern Musket. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel.Lloyd, Ernest Marsh (1908), Review of the History of Infantry, p. 155 British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign.Howe, William, Orderly Book, p. 116 Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations,Howe, Orderly Book, 20 June 1777, p. 3. which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.Trevelyan, Volume III, p. 6; Volume IV, p. 158\n\nEvery battalion in America had organized its own rifle company by the end of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the Baker Rifle in 1801.Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 83. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the flash pan,Sawyer, Charles Winthrop (1910), \"Firearms in American History\", p. 99 while heavy rain could soak the paper cartridge, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire.Trevelyan, Volume IV, p. 224 Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: \"Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog\".Trevelyan, Volume IV, p.34\n\nProvisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain.Minute Book of a Board of General Officers of the British Army in New York, 1781. New York Historical Society Collections, 1916, p. 81. The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land.Black (2001), p. 14 Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed.Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 7, 52 After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. The food that could be bought in America was purchased at vastly inflated prices.Minute Book (1916), p. 81 Soldiers stationed in the West Indies perhaps suffered the worst; the garrison commander of Tobago, Barbados, and Antigua frequently complained of the near-total lack of regular supply from Britain, and the food that could be bought was so expensive that the pay of the troops was inadequate to cover the costs.War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:51, Graham to Jenkinson, 13 September and 23 November 1779; 1:51, Vaughan to Jenkinson, 2 November 1780\n\nFood supplies were frequently in terrible condition, infested with mould, weevils, worms, and maggots.Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:118, Chamier to Robinson, 9 Nov 1776 Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats,Treasury Papers, 64:103, Day to Robinson, 22 Aug. 1777 and their containers were too fragile to sustain a long ocean voyage or the rigors of campaigning.Treasury Papers, 64:200, Marsh to Navy Board, 17 Dec 1779 The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil.Treasury Papers, 64:120, Paumier to Robinson, 20 June & 7 August 1779 British troops stationed in America were often on the verge of starvation.Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:201, Wier to Robinson, 14 September 1780\n\nLife at sea was little better. Sailors and passengers were issued a daily food ration, largely consisting of hardtack and beer. The hardtack was often infested by weevils and was so tough that it earned the nicknames \"molar breakers\" and \"worm castles\", and it sometimes had to be broken up with cannon shot. Meat supplies often spoiled on long voyages.Lowell, Edward J and Andrews, Raymond J (June 15, 1997) \"The Hessians in the Revolutionary War\", Corner House Pub, , p. 56 The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables gave rise to scurvy, one of the biggest killers at sea. Rum was issued as part of a daily ration and was a popular drink among soldiers and sailors alike, often mixed with fresh water to make grog.Blue, Anthony Dias (2004). The Complete Book of Spirits : A Guide to Their History, Production, and Enjoyment. HarperCollins. , p. 77\n\nDiscipline \n\nDiscipline was harsh in the armed forces, and the lash was used to punish even trivial offences—and not used sparingly.Howe, (Sir) William, Orderly Book, edited by B. F. Stevens (London, 1890), pp. 263, 288 For instance, two redcoats received 1,000 lashes each for robbery during the Saratoga campaign,Burgoyne, John, Orderly Book, edited by E. B. O'Callaghan (Albany, 1860), p. 74. while another received 800 lashes for striking a superior officer.Howe, Orderly Book, pp 263, 288 Flogging was a common punishment in the Royal Navy and came to be associated with the stereotypical hardiness of sailors.\"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]\". National Maritime Museum.\n\nDespite the harsh discipline, a distinct lack of self-discipline pervaded all ranks of the British forces. Soldiers had an intense passion for gambling, reaching such excesses that troops would often wager their own uniforms.Lamb, Memoir, p. 74 Many drank heavily, and this was not exclusive to the lower ranks; William Howe was said to have seen many \"crapulous mornings\" while campaigning in New York. John Burgoyne drank heavily on a nightly basis towards the end of the Saratoga campaign. The two generals were also reported to have found solace with the wives of subordinate officers to ease the stressful burdens of command.Riedesel, Mrs. General, Letters and Journals, translated from the original German by W. L. Stone (Albany, 1867) p. 125 During the Philadelphia campaign, British officers deeply offended local Quakers by entertaining their mistresses in the houses where they had been quartered.Stedman, Charles, History of the American War (London, 1794), Volume I, p. 309 Some reports indicated that British troops were generally scrupulous in their treatment of non-combatants.Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 35 This is contrasted diaries of Hessian soldiers, who recorded their disapproval of British conduct towards the colonists, such as the destruction of property and the execution of prisoners.Steven Schwamenfeld. \"The Foundation of British Strength: National Identity and the Common British Soldier.\" Ph.D. diss., Florida State University 2007, p. 123-124\n\nThe presence of Hessian soldiers caused considerable anxiety among the colonists, both Patriot and Loyalist, who viewed them as brutal mercenaries.Schwamenfeld (2007), p.123-124 British soldiers were often contemptuous in their treatment of Hessian troops, despite orders from General Howe that \"the English should treat the Germans as brothers\". The order only began to have any real effect when the Hessians learned to speak a minimal degree of English, which was seen as a prerequisite for the British troops to accord them any respect.Schwamenfeld (2007), p. 123\n\nDuring peacetime, the Army's idleness led to it being riddled with corruption and inefficiency, resulting in many administrative difficulties once campaigning began.Clayton, Anthony (2007). The British Officer: Leading the Army from 1660 to the Present. Routledge. , p. 65\n\nStrategic deficiencies \n\nThe British leadership soon discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists, causing a sudden re-think in British planning. The ineffective initial response of British military and civil officials to the onset of the rebellion had allowed the advantage to shift to the colonists, as British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony. A microcosm of these shortcomings were evident at the Battle of Bunker Hill. It took ten hours for the British leadership to respond following the sighting of the Americans on the Charlestown Peninsula, giving the colonists ample time to reinforce their defenses.French, pp. 263–265 Rather than opt for a simple flanking attack that would have rapidly succeeded with minimal loss,Frothingham, p. 155 the British decided on repeated frontal attacks. The results were telling; the British suffered 1,054 casualties of a force of around 3,000 after repeated frontal assaults.Frothingham pp. 191, 194 The British leadership had nevertheless remained excessively optimistic, believing that just two regiments could suppress the rebellion in Massachusetts.Frothingham, p. 156Ferling, 2015, p. 127-129\n\nDebate persists over whether a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome. Ferling argues that the odds were so long, the defeat of Britain was nothing short of a miracle.John E. Ferling, Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence (2009), pp. 562–77. Ellis, however, considers that the odds always favored the Americans, and questions whether a British victory by any margin was realistic. Ellis argues that the British squandered their only opportunities for a decisive success in 1777, and that the strategic decisions undertaken by William Howe underestimated the challenges posed by the Americans. Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory \"would never come again\". Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.[http://history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch04.htm Richard W. Stewart, ed., American Military History Volume 1 The United States Army And The Forging Of A Nation, 1775–1917\" (2005)] ch 4  \"The Winning of Independence, 1777–1783\" (2005), p. 103.\n\nWilliam Howe \n\nHistorians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans. Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory. At Long Island, Howe failed to even attempt an encirclement of Washington,Adams, Charles Francis, [https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric18951896jame#page/668/mode/1up \"Battle of Long Island\"], in American Historical Review (1895–1896), pp. 668–669. and actively restrained his subordinates from mounting an aggressive pursuit of the defeated American army. At White Plains, he refused to engage Washington's vulnerable army, and instead concentrated his efforts upon a hill which offered the British no strategic advantage. After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army. Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats, Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. The decision left Burgoyne precariously isolated, and left the Americans confounded at the decision. Alden argues Howe may have been motivated by political opportunism; if Burgoyne was successful, he would receive the credit for a decisive victory, and not Howe. However, the confusion was further compounded by the lack of explicit and contradictory instructions from London., p. 126 When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so confused Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the Battle of Brandywine, and again after the Battle of Germantown. At the Battle of White Marsh, Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear, and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides. While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war. Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.Frothingham pp. 152–153Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005). Empire City: New York Through the Centuries. Columbia University Press. , p. 20 During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns.Colonial Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:93, Howe to Dartmouth, 1st December 1775  Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 7 June and 7 July 1776A View of the Evidence (London, 1783), p. 13\n\nDuring the winter of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the Battle of Trenton, and the concurrent Battle of Princeton.Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57 While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 30 Nov 1776 Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287\n\nClinton and Cornwallis \n\nIn 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at Camden, Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the Battle of Kings Mountain, and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the Battle of Cowpens. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support. Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000). As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive war of attrition.Trevelyan, Sir George Otto (1914). George the Third and Charles Fox: The Concluding Part of The American Revolution. New York and elsewhere: Longmans, Green and Co. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. ., p. 221\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North. London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction. Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown. Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,, p. 29 owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to sally out and engage before siege lines could be erected,Wickwire, Franklin and Mary (1970). Cornwallis: The American Adventure. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. . p. 362 despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers. Expecting relief to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. ., p. 337 These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. , p. 16\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778 That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778 Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779 By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780\n\nCampaign issues \n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306 The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict,Rossman, Vadim (2016), \"Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation\", Taylor & Francis, , p. 2 yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved 10 June 2017 Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was agrarian, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.\n\nThe need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in Scotland and Ireland.Black (2001), p. 14. For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.Wilson, David K (2005). The Southern Strategy: Britain's Conquest of South Carolina and Georgia, 1775–1780. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. . . p. 112 Neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Patriots when brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs across the Carolinas in the later stages of the war.Black (2001), pp. 14–16 (Harsh methods), pp. 35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p. 16 (neutrals into revolutionaries). Conversely, Loyalists were often emboldened when Patriots resorted to intimidating suspected Tories, such as destroying property or tarring and feathering.Leonard Woods Larabee, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) pp 164–65Calhoon, Robert M. The Loyalists in Revolutionary America, 1760–1781 (1973) The vastness of the American countryside and the limited manpower available meant that the British could never simultaneously defeat the Americans and occupy captured territory. One British statesman described the attempt as \"like trying to conquer a map\".Curtis, \"The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion\n\nWealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London and were successful in convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown.Lorenzo Sabine, [https://books.google.com/books?vid\nOCLC00425953&idQjUNAAAAIAAJ&printsec\ntitlepage#vonepage&q\n%22In%20nearly%20every%20loyalist%20letter%22&ffalse Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution], Vol. I (1864) p. 48; Sabine adds they were certainly wrong. Consequently, British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists, which never transpired on the scale required. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots)Greene and Pole (1999), p. 235 and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780. The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars,Black (2001), p. 12. which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances.Black (2001), p. 13–14. The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.\n\nUpon the entry of France and Spain into the conflict, the British were forced to severely limit the number of troops and warships that they sent to North America in order to defend other key territories and the British mainland. As a result, King George III abandoned any hope of subduing America militarily while he had a European war to contend with.Ferling (2007), p. 294 The small size of Britain's army left them unable to concentrate their resources primarily in one theater as they had done in the Seven Years' War, leaving them at a critical disadvantage. The British were compelled to disperse troops from the Americas to Europe and the East Indies, and these forces were unable to assist one other as a result, precariously exposing them to defeat. In North America, the immediate strategic focus of the French, Spanish, and British shifted to Jamaica,Dull, (1985) p. 244 whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the economy of the Thirteen Colonies combined.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Britain had lost some of her most populous colonies. However, the economic effects of the loss were negligible in the long-term, and she became a global superpower just 32 years after the end of the conflict.Tellier, L.-N. (2009). Urban World History: an Economic and Geographical Perspective. Quebec: PUQ. p. 463. .\n\nPatriots \n\nThe Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.Pole and Greene, eds.  Companion to the American Revolution, ch. 36–39.\n\nMotivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the Battle of Bennington, the Battles of Saratoga and even defeats such as the Battle of GermantownTrevelyan, p. 249. proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.Ketchum (1997), pp. 405–48.\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as George Washington, Horatio Gates, Charles Lee, Richard Montgomery and Francis Marion all had military experience with the British Army during the French and Indian War. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the Revolutionary War Drill Manual.Philander D. Chase. \"Steuben, Friedrich Wilhelm von\";\n[http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00855.html American National Biography Online (2000)].\nAccessed January 29, 2015. When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the Battle of Monmouth.Ferling, John (2007), pp. 294–95\"\n\nWhen the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.\n\nSeeking to coordinate military efforts, the Continental Congress established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.\n\nThree current branches of the United States Military trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the United States Army comes from the Continental Army, formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The United States Navy recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the Continental Navy.  And the United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the war, formed  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.Crocker (2006), p. 51. At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard privateers during the war. The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships. John Paul Jones became the first great American naval hero, capturing HMS Drake on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.Higginbotham (1983), pp. 331–46.\n\nArmies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable, on the American side, to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities; and, on the British side, to the difficulty of transporting troops across the Atlantic, as well as the dependence on local supplies, which the Patriots tried to cut off. The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,Boatner (1974), p. 264. and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.Duffy, Christopher (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id\nm1aRAgAAQBAJ&pgPA13 Military Experience in the Age of Reason]. London: Routledge. . p. 13. In the original 1987 edition, p. 17. By comparison, Duffy notes that in an era when European rulers were generally revising their forces downward, in favor of a size that could be most effectively controlled (the very different perspective of mass conscript armies came later, during the French Revolutionary and then the Napoleonic Wars), the largest army that Frederick the Great ever led into battle was 65,000 men (at Prague in 1757), and at other times he commanded between 23,000 and 50,000 men, considering the latter the most effective number.\n\nAfrican Americans \n\nAfrican Americans—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to Patriot masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord Dunmore's Proclamation. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from Saint-Domingue with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp. 64–69.\n\nTens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73 This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.Kolchin, p.73 Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.Cassadra Pybus, \"Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution\", William and Mary Quarterly (2005) 62#2 pp: 243–264. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491601 in JSTOR]\n\nAmerican Indians \n\nMost American Indians east of the Mississippi River were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the Iroquois tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.Greene and Pole (1999), p. 393; Boatner (1974), p. 545. The powerful Iroquois Confederacy was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga nations sided with the British. Members of the Mohawk nation fought on both sides. Many Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the Sullivan Expedition on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders Joseph Louis Cook and Joseph Brant sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.\n\nEarly in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.\n\nCreek and Seminole allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the Broad River in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined Thomas Brown's raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the Siege of Savannah. Many Indians were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, Chickasaws, and Choctaws fought in major battles such as the Battle of Fort Charlotte, the Battle of Mobile, and the Siege of Pensacola.\n\nRace and class \n\nPybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots. The British took some 12,000 at the end of the war; of these 8000 remained in slavery. Including those who left during the war, a total of about 8000 to 10,000 slaves gained freedom.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491601 Cassandra Pybus, \"Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution\"], William and Mary Quarterly 2005 62#2: 243–264. About 4000 freed slaves went to Nova Scotia and 1200 blacks remained slaves.John N. Grant, \"Black Immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776–1815.\" Journal of Negro History (1973): 253–270.

Walker, The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783–1870 (1992).\n\nBaller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" Journal of Family History (2006) 31(1): 28–44. . Fulltext: online in EBSCO.\n\nMcDonnell (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, the middling yeomen (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.Michael A. McDonnell, \"Class War: Class Struggles During the American Revolution in Virginia\", William and Mary Quarterly 2006 63(2): 305–344.  Fulltext: online at History Cooperative.",

    "aggregatedText" : "The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also known as the American War of Independence,Modern British writers generally favor \"American War of Independence\", rather than \"American Rebellion\" or \"War of American Independence\".  was a global war that began as a conflict between Great Britain and its Thirteen Colonies which declared independence as the United States of America.\n\nAfter 1765, growing philosophical and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony. Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.The colony of Georgia joined later.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at Concord in April 1775 led to open combat. Militia forces then besieged Boston, forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army. Concurrently, an American attempt to invade Quebec and raise rebellion against the British failed decisively. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its declaration on July 4. Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive, capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at Trenton and Princeton restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an invasion from Quebec under John Burgoyne, intending to isolate the New England Colonies. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate campaign against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at Saratoga in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences; France formally allied with the Americans and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an ally of France but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the Kingdom of Mysore attacked the British in India, and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into open war. In North America, the British mounted a \"Southern strategy\" led by Charles Cornwallis which hinged upon a Loyalist uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at King's Mountain and Cowpens. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive French naval victory deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the Comte de Rochambeau and Washington then besieged Cornwallis' army and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n\nWhigs in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in North America, but the war continued in Europe and India. Britain remained under siege in Gibraltar but scored a major victory over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the Treaty of Paris in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive,Brooks, Richard (editor). Atlas of World Military History. HarperCollins, 2000, p. 101 \"Washington's success in keeping the army together deprived the British of victory, but French intervention won the war.\" but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some minor territorial gains but failed in its primary aim of recovering Gibraltar. The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede territory to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies concluded in 1784 without any territorial changes.\n\nBackground \n\nEarly seeds \n\nIn 1651, the Parliament of England sought to regulate trade in America by passing the Navigation Acts, ensuring that trade only enriched Britain.Pestana, Carla Gardina (2004). The English Atlantic in an Age of Revolution: 1640–1661. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: Harvard University Press. p. 120. The economic effects were minimal, but they triggered serious political friction.  The American colonists had fought King Philip's War without significant assistance from the Crown, and this contributed to a growing sense of American identity separate from that of Britain.Lepore (1998), The Name of War (1999) pp 5–7 Britain continued to assert control into the 1680s,Curtis P. Nettels, The Roots of American Civilization: A History of American Colonial Life (1938) p. 297. culminating in the abrogation of colonial charters, pp. 148–56, 155–57, 169–70 and the establishment of the Dominion of New England in 1686. Colonists, however, felt that the Dominion was undermining their democratic libertyLovejoy, pp. 180, 192–93, 197, pp. 169–70 and they overthrew it in 1689;, pp. 190–91, p. 201 the Crown made no attempt to restore it., p. 596, p. 430\n\nThe British government continued to pursue trade control, however, passing acts that taxed wool, hats,Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?idcrhJ5-mbDygC&pg\nPA93& Empires to Nations: Expansion in America, 1713–1824], p.93 (1974) and molasses.Draper pg. 100. The quote provided by Draper came from Leo Francis Stock’s Proceedings and Debates of the British Parliaments respecting North America (1937) vol. 4. pg. 182  The Molasses Act of 1733 was especially egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial trade relied on the product. The taxes severely damaged the local economy, and consequently they were rarely paid. Smuggling, bribery, piracy, and intimidation of customs officials became commonplace., pp. 95-e99\nColonial wars were also a contributing factor. The return of Louisbourg to France in 1748 following the War of the Austrian Succession caused considerable resentment in New England, the colonists having expended great effort in subduing the fortress only to have it returned to their erstwhile enemy.Guizot, M. A popular history of France, from the earliest times.

Colonists condemned the tax because their rights as Englishmen protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had no elected representatives. Parliament argued that the colonies were \"represented virtually\", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire. Parliament did repeal the act in 1766; however, it also affirmed its right to pass laws that were binding on the colonies. From 1767, Parliament began passing legislation to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty while inadvertently increasing resentment among the colonists, and opposition soon became widespread.Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop Liberty in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to extradite colonists to face trial in England.Knollenberg, Growth, 69 Tensions rose after the murder of Christopher Seider by a customs official in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the Boston Massacre. In 1772, colonists in Rhode Island boarded and burned a customs schooner. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the Tea Act in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy East India Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the governor of Massachusetts permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor. So, the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests, an incident that later became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It closed Boston Harbor until the tea was paid for and revoked the Massachusetts Charter, taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/mass_gov_act.aspIan R. Christie and Benjamin W. Labaree, Empire or Independence, 1760–1776 (New York: Norton, 1976) p. 188. Further measures allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity., p. 9 Further laws allowed the governor to billet troops in private property without permission.Ammerman points out that the act only permitted soldiers to be quartered in unoccupied buildings—although they were still private property. (Ammerman, In the Common Cause, 10) The colonists referred to the measures as the \"Intolerable Acts\", and they argued that both their constitutional rights and their natural rights were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to all of America.Ammerman, In the Common Cause, 15. The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the Patriots and curtailing Loyalist sentiment.\n\nColonial response \n\nThe colonists responded by establishing the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve coloniesFerling, John. (2003). A Leap in the Dark. Oxford University Press. p. 112. convened the First Continental Congress to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal to create an American parliament to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed a compact declaring a trade boycott against Britain.Kramnick, Isaac (ed); Thomas Paine (1982). Common Sense. Penguin Classics. p. 21. The Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to trade regulations for the benefit of the empire,\"Resolved, 4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council: and as the English colonists are not represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed: But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament, as are bonfide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects, in America, without their consent.\" quoted from the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress] October 14, 1774. and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.\n\nParliament refused to yield. In 1775, it declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and enforced a blockade of the colony.Cogliano, Francis D. Revolutionary America, 1763–1815: A Political History. Routledge, 1999. pp. 47Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 47–48 It then passed legislation to limit colonial trade to the British West Indies and the British Isles. Colonial ships were barred from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a measure which pleased Canadiens but damaged New England's economy. These increasing tensions led to a mutual scramble for ordnance and pushed the colonies toward open war.Alan Axelrod, [https://books.google.com/books?idiBvtuSWgt_QC&pg\nPA83&redir_escy#v\nonepage&q&f=false The Real History of the American Revolution: A New Look at the Past], p. 83 Thomas Gage was the British Commander-in-Chief and military governor of Massachusetts, and he received orders on April 14, 1775 to disarm the local militias.Fischer, p. 76\n\nCourse of the war \n\nWar breaks out (1775–1776) \n\nOn April 18, 1775, 700 troops were sent to confiscate militia ordnance stored at Concord.Fischer, p. 85Chidsey, p. 6.

Washington then moved his army to New York.\n\nMeanwhile, British officials in Quebec began lobbying Indian tribes to support them,Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 293 while the Americans urged them to maintain their neutrality.Glatthaar (2006), p. 91Glatthaar (2006), p. 93 In April 1775, Congress feared an Anglo-Indian attack from Canada and authorized an invasion of Quebec. Quebec had a largely Francophone population and had been under British rule for only 12 years, and the Americans expected that they would welcome being liberated from the British.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 242, p. 141Mark R.

On October 11, the British defeated the American squadron, forcing them to withdraw to Ticonderoga and ending the campaign. The invasion cost the Patriots their support in British public opinion,Watson (1960), p. 203. while aggressive anti-Loyalist policies diluted Canadien support.Arthur S.

The Patriots continued to view Quebec as a strategic aim, though no further attempts to invade were ever made.Smith (1907), volume 2, pp. 459–552\n\nIn Virginia, Royal governor Lord Dunmore had attempted to disarm the militia as tensions increased, although no fighting broke out.Selby and Higginbotham, p. 2 He issued a proclamation on November 7, 1775 promising freedom for slaves who fled their Patriot masters to fight for the Crown. Dunmore's troops were overwhelmed by Patriots at Great Bridge, and Dunmore fled to naval ships anchored off Norfolk. Subsequent negotiations broke down, so Dunmore ordered the ships to destroy the town.Russell, p. 73\n\nFighting broke out on November 19 in South Carolina between Loyalist and Patriot militias,McCrady, p. 89 and the Loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony., pp. 80–81 Loyalists were recruited in North Carolina to reassert colonial rule in the South, but they were decisively defeated and Loyalist sentiment was subdued., p. 33 A troop of British regulars set out to reconquer South Carolina and launched an attack on Charleston on June 28, 1776,Hibbert, C: Rebels and Redcoats, p.106 but it failed and effectively left the South in Patriot control until 1780.Kepner, F,  \"A British View of the Siege of Charleston, 1776\", The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 11, No. 1.

King George then issued a Proclamation of Rebellion on August 23, 1775, which only served to embolden the colonists in their determination to become independent.Ketchum, p.211 After a speech by the King, Parliament rejected coercive measures on the colonies by 170 votes.Maier, American Scripture, 25.

The Irish Parliament pledged to send troops to America, and Irish Catholics were allowed to enlist in the army for the first time. Irish Protestants favored the Americans, while Catholics favored the King.\n\nThe initial hostilities provided a sobering military lesson for the British, causing them to rethink their views on colonial military capability.Ketchum, pp. 208–209Frothingham (1903), p. 298 The weak British response gave the Patriots the advantage, and the British lost control over every colony. The army had been deliberately kept small in England since 1688 to prevent abuses of power by the King.Scheer, p. 64 Parliament secured treaties with small German states for additional troopshttp://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/hessiansotherge00lowe and sent an army of 32,000 men to America after a year, the largest that it had ever sent outside Europe at the time.\n\nIn the colonies, the success of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense had boosted public support for independence.Christie and Labaree, Empire or Independence, 270; Maier, American Scripture, 31–32.Maier, American Scripture, 33–34 On July 2, Congress voted in favor of independence with twelve affirmatives and one abstention,Boyd, Evolution, 19 issuing its declaration on July 4.Maier, American Scripture, 160–61 Washington read the declaration to his men and the citizens of New York on July 9,Fischer (2004), p. 29. invigorating the crowd to tear down a lead statue of the King and melting it to make bullets.Maier, American Scripture, 156–57 British Tories criticized the signatories for not extending the same standards of equality to slaves.\n\nPatriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived,Encyclopedia of the American Revolution Mark M.

Festivities took place in London, public support reached a peak,. and the King awarded the Order of the Bath to William Howe. The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year.Ketchum (1973), p. 191, 269 The American defeat revealed what one writer views as Washington's strategic deficiencies, such as dividing a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one, his inexperienced staff misreading the situation, and his troops fleeing in disorder when fighting began.Charles Francis Adams, \"The Battle of Long Island,\" American Historical Review Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul. 1896), pp. 650–670 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1833753 in JSTOR] In the meantime, the British entered winter quarters and were in a good place to resume campaigning.Schecter, pp. 259–263\n\nOn December 25, 1776, Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware River, and his army overwhelmed the Hessian garrison at Trenton, New Jersey the following morning, taking 900 prisoners.Fischer p. 254.

Burgoyne's plan was to establish control of the Champlain-George-Hudson route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England.Ketchum (1997), p. 84 Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance. Howe instead argued capturing Philadelphia and defeating Washington was a priority.Ketchum, Saratoga (1999), p. 81 Germain approved this plan, leaving Howe unable to assist Burgoyne.Martin, p. 11-15 Washington himself was baffled by Howe's choices.John E. Ferling, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington (2010) p. Alden argues Howe was influenced by the idea that, upon success, he would not receive credit, but Burgoyne.Alden, The American Revolution (1954) p. 118 Controversy persists over whether Germain approved Burgoyne's plan after reading Howe's, and whether he shared this information with his subordinates.Samuel B. Griffith, The War for American Independence: From 1760 to the Surrender at Yorktown in 1781 Howe was not given any explicit orders to assist Burgoyne; however, a copy Germain sent to Quebec explicitly stated Howe was to assist Burgoyne's efforts.Martin, p. 11Fisher, Sydney George.

Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, quickly capturing Ticonderoga on July 5. The hasty withdrawal of the Continental Army after little resistance outraged the American public.Pancake (1977), p.125 Burgoyne's pursuit ran into stiff resistance at Hubbardton and Fort Anne. Leaving 1,300 men behind as a garrison, Burgoyne continued the advance.Nickerson (1967), pp. 146–157, 438 Progress was slow; the Americans blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams and denuded the area of food.Ketchum (1997), p. 244-249 Meanwhile, Barry St. Ledger's diversionary column laid siege to Fort Stanwix. St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his Indian support abandoned him.Pancake (1977), p. 145Nickerson (1967), pp. 271–275 On August 16, a British foraging expedition was soundly defeated at Bennington, and more than 700 troops were captured. As a result of the defeat, the vast majority of Burgoyne's Indian support abandoned him.Ketchum (1997), pp. 285–323. Meanwhile, Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned, and would be unable to render aid.Ketchum (1997), p. 283\n\nHaving considered his options, Burgoyne decided to continue the advance.Nickerson (1967), pp. 296. On September 19, he attempted to flank the American position, and clashed at Freeman's Farm. The British won, but at the cost of 600 casualties. Burgoyne then dug in, but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters, and critical supplies were running low.Ketchum (1997), pp. 337–378. Henry Clinton did capture two key forts on October 6 to divert American resources, though he turned back ten days later.Nickerson (1967), pp. 343–405. Meanwhile, the American army was growing in size daily,Nickerson (1967), pp. 327. swelling to some 15,000 men. pp. 249. On October 7, a British reconnaissance in force against the American lines was repulsed with heavy losses. Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit, and by October 13, he was surrounded. With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17, and 6,222 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans.Ketchum (1997), pp. 403–425. The decisive success spurred France to enter the war as an ally of the United States, securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain, that of foreign assistance.Edmund Morgan, The Birth of the Republic: 1763–1789 (1956) pp 82–83Higginbotham (1983), pp. 188–98\n\nMeanwhile, Howe launched his campaign against Washington, though his initial efforts to bring him to battle in June 1777 failed.Stedman, Charles, [https://books.google.com/books?idbmQFAAAAQAAJ&printsec\nfrontcover&sourcegbs_atb#v\nonepage&q&ffalse The History of the Origin, Progress and Termination of the American War Volume I] (1794), pp. 287–89. Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via New Jersey, or by sea via the Delaware Bay, even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary. Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne.

On December 19, Washington's army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge. Poor conditions and supply problems resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 troops.Freedman, 2008, p. 1-30 Howe, only 20 miles (32 km) away, made no effort to attack, which critics observed could have ended the war.Noel Fairchild Busch, Winter Quarters: George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge (Liveright, 1974).[https://web.archive.org/web/20120619002020/http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/risch/chpt-14.htm \"A Concluding Commentary\"] Supplying Washington's Army (1981).[http://history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch04.htm \"The Winning of Independence, 1777–1783\"] American Military History Volume I (2005).\n\nThe Continental Army was put through a new training program, supervised by Baron von Steuben, introducing the most modern Prussian methods of drilling.Paul Douglas Lockhart, The Drillmaster of Valley Forge: The Baron de Steuben and the Making of the American Army (2008). Meanwhile, Howe resigned and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778. Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France's entry into the war. On June 18, the British departed Philadelphia, with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit.Text incorporated from [http://www.nps.gov/vafo Valley Forge National Historical Park] website, which is in the public domain. The two armies fought at Monmouth Court House on June 28, with the Americans holding the field, greatly boosting morale and confidence.Freedman, 2008, p. 70-83 By July, both armies were back in the same positions they had been two years prior.\n\nForeign intervention \n\nThe defeat at Saratoga caused considerable anxiety in Britain over foreign intervention. The North ministry sought reconciliation with the colonies by consenting to their original demands,Reid, Authority to Tax, 51. although Lord North refused to grant independence.Stockley (2001), p. 11-12 No positive reply was received from the Americans.\n\nFrench foreign minister the Comte de Vergennes was strongly anti-British, and he sought a casus belli to go to war with Britain following the conquest of Canada in 1763.Hoffman, Ronald, and Peter J. Albert, eds. Diplomacy and Revolution: The Franco-American Alliance of 1778 (United States Capitol Historical Society, 1981) The French had covertly supplied the Americans through neutral Dutch ports since the onset of the war, proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign.\"Journal of the American Revolution, The Gunpowder shortage (September 9, 2013).[http://allthingsliberty.com/2013/09/the-gunpowder-shortage/]James Brown Scott, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?iduc1.32106006332446;view\n1up;seq37 Historical Introduction], p.8–9 in Samuel Flagg Bemis, Ed. The American Secretaries of State and their diplomacy  V.1–2, 1963. The French public favored war, though Vergennes and King Louis XVI were hesitant, owing to the military and financial risk. The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile, but doing so also brought major concerns. The King was concerned that Britain's concessions would be accepted, and that she would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the Caribbean.Perkins, James Breck, [http://www.americanrevolution.org/frconfiles/fr12.html France In The Revolution] (1911).Corwin, Edward Samuel, [https://archive.org/stream/frenchpolicyamer00corwuoft#page/121/mode/1up French Policy and the American Alliance] (1916), pp. 121–48. To prevent this, France formally recognized the United States on February 6, 1778 and followed with a military alliance. France aimed to expel Britain from the Newfoundland fishery, end restrictions on Dunkirk sovereignty, regain free trade in India, recover Senegal and Dominica, and restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions pertaining to Anglo-French trade., p. 15, p. 290\n\nSpain was wary of provoking war with Britain before she was ready, so she covertly supplied the Patriots via her colonies in New Spain., p. 87, p. 99 Congress hoped to persuade Spain into an open alliance, so the first American Commission met with the Count of Aranda in 1776. Spain was still reluctant to make an early commitment, owing to a lack of direct French involvement, the threat against their treasure fleets, and the possibility of war with Portugal, Spain's neighbor and a close ally of Britain., p. 1:408 However, Spain affirmed its desire to support the Americans the following year, hoping to weaken Britain's empire., p. 4  In the Spanish-Portuguese War (1776-77), the Portuguese threat was neutralized. On 12 April 1779, Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez with France and went to war against Britain.Clarfield, Gerard. United States Diplomatic History: From Revolution to Empire. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1992. Spain sought to recover Gibraltar and Menorca in Europe, as well as Mobile and Pensacola in Florida, and also to expel the British from Central America., p. 19, p. 9\n\nMeanwhile, George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight. He did not welcome war with France, but he believed that Britain had made all necessary steps to avoid it and cited the British victories over France in the Seven Years' War as a reason to remain optimistic.Syrett (1998), p. 17 Britain tried in vain to find a powerful ally to engage France, leaving it isolated,, p. 264-72 preventing Britain from focusing the majority of her efforts in one theater,Cf., Richard Pares, (1936): 429–65, p. 18 and forcing a major diversion of military resources from America.Ketchum (1997), p. 405–448Higginbotham (1983), pp. 175–88 Despite this, the King determined never to recognize American independence and to ravage the colonies indefinitely, or until they pleaded to return to the yoke of the Crown.Trevelyan (1912), vol. 1, p. 4., p. 5. Mahan argues that Britain's attempt to fight in multiple theaters simultaneously without major allies was fundamentally flawed, citing impossible mutual support, exposing the forces to defeat in detail.Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783 (Boston:Little, Brown, 1890), p. 534\n\nSince the outbreak of the conflict, Britain had appealed to her ally, the neutral Dutch Republic, to loan her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America, but pro-American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request. Consequently, the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support, but the Republic still refused. Moreover, American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their West Indies colonies. French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports. The Republic maintained free trade with France following France's declaration of war on Britain, citing a prior concession by Britain on this issue. Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping, and even firing upon it. Consequently, the Republic joined the First League of Armed Neutrality to enforce their neutral status. The Republic had also given sanctuary to American privateers and had drafted a treaty of commerce with the Americans. Britain argued that these actions contravened the Republic's neutral stance and declared war in December 1780.\n\nInternational war breaks out (1778–1780) \n\nEurope \n\nSoon after France declared war, French and British fleets fought an indecisive action off Ushant on 27 July 1778., p. 412 Spain entered the war on 12 April 1779, with a primary goal of capturing Gibraltar,, p. 9 Spanish troops under the Duc de Crillon laid siege to the Rock on 24 June., p. 385-87 The naval  blockade, however, was relatively weak, and the British were able to resupply the garrison., p. 37 Meanwhile, a plan was formulated for a combined Franco-Spanish invasion of the British mainland, but the expedition failed due to a combination of poor planning, disease, logistical issues, and high financial expenditures.., p. 3 However, a diversionary Franco-American squadron did meet with some success on 23 September under John Paul Jones. On 16 January 1780, the Royal Navy under George Rodney scored a major victory over the Spanish, weakening the naval blockade of Gibraltar.\n\nA Franco-Spanish fleet commanded by Luis de Córdova intercepted and decisively defeated a large British convoy off the Azores led by John Moutray on 9 August which was bound for the West Indies.Volo, M.

In early 1780, he mounted an expedition to take Mobile, setting off with 750 troops on 11 January and joined by reinforcements from Havana. They commenced siege operations on March 1, and the town fell after a 14-day siege., p. 255 Gálvez had hoped to push on to Pensacola, the British capital of West Florida; however, a hurricane devastated his expedition, stalling it till 1781., p. 36\n\nIn Central America, the defense of Guatemala was a priority for Spain. The British intended to capture the key fortress of San Fernando de Omoa and drive the Spanish from the region., p. 151 After inadequate first attempts, 1,200 British troops led by William Dalrymple arrived on 16 October, and they captured the fort on 20 October.Chávez, p. 152 However, the British suffered terribly due to disease and were forced to abandon the fort on 29 November;Chávez, p. 153 Spanish troops subsequently reoccupied it.Chávez, p. 158 In 1780, Jamaica's governor John Dalling planned an expedition to cut New Spain in two by capturing Granada, which would subsequently allow them full control of the San Juan River., p. 9 A British expedition set out on 3 February 1780, led by John Polson and Horatio Nelson.Southey p.10 They reached Fort San Juan on 17 March and laid siege, capturing it on 29 April., p. 73 The British were ravaged by disease, p. 32 and were running low on food due to poor logistics. They withdrew on 8 November, the expedition having suffered a decisive defeat;, p. 307 some 2,500 troops had perished, making it the costliest British disaster of the war., p. 173\n\nIndia \n\nThe British East India Company moved quickly to capture French possessions in India when they learned about the hostilities with France, and they took Pondicherry on 19 October 1778 after a two-week siege., p. 23-25 The Company resolved to drive the French completely out of India,, p. 79 and they captured the Malabar port of Mahé in 1779 where French ordnance passed through.\n\nMahé was under the protection of Mysore's ruler Hyder Ali (the Tipu Sultan), and tensions were already inflamed because the British had supported Malabar rebels who had risen against him;, p.56 so the fall of Mahé precipitated war.Cust, Eduard. (1862). \"Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century, Compiled from the Most Authentic Histories of the Period\" Volume 3, University of Lausanne., p. 222 Hyder Ali invaded the Carnatic region in July 1780 and laid siege to Tellicherry and Arcot. A British relief force of 7,000 men under William Baille was intercepted and destroyed by the Tipu Sultan on 10 September, the worst defeat suffered by a European army in India at the time.Ramaswami, N.S. (1984). Political History of Carnatic under the Nawabs. New Delhi: Abhinav Publications. p. 225\n\nAli then renewed the siege at Arcot instead of pressing on for a decisive victory against a second British army at Madras, capturing it on 3 November. The delay allowed British forces to regroup for campaigning the following year.Barua, p. 80\n\nStalemate in the North (1778–1780) \n\nHenry Clinton withdrew from Philadelphia, consolidating his forces in New York following the British defeat at Saratoga and the entry of France into the war. French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to North America in April 1778 to assist Washington, and he arrived shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York.Morrissey, p. 77 The Franco-American forces felt that New York's defenses were too formidable for the French fleet,, pp.174–175 and they opted to attack Newport.Morrissey, p. 78 This effort was launched on August 29, but it failed when the French opted to withdraw, and this displeased the Americans., p.102-106 The war then ground down to a stalemate, with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes, such as those at Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor. In the summer of 1779, the Americans captured British posts at Stony Point and Paulus Hook.\n\nIn July, Clinton unsuccessfully attempted to coax Washington into a decisive engagement by making a major raid into Connecticut., p. 170 That month, a large American naval operation attempted to retake Maine, but it resulted in the worst American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941., p. 149 The high frequency of Iroquois raids on the locals compelled Washington to mount a punitive expedition which destroyed a large number of Iroquois settlements, but the effort ultimately failed to stop the raids. During the winter of 1779–80, the Continental Army suffered greater hardships than at Valley Forge.Tolson, Jay (July 7–14, 2008). How Washington's Savvy Won the Day. U.S. News & World Report. Morale was poor; public support was being eroded by the long war; the national currency was virtually worthless; the army was plagued with supply problems; desertion was common; and whole regiments mutinied over the conditions in early 1780.Ketchum, pp. 8,12\n\nIn 1780, Clinton launched an attempt to retake New Jersey. On June 7, 6,000 men invaded under Hessian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen, but they met stiff resistance from the local militia. The British held the field, but Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington's main army and withdrew., p. 174-175 Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt two weeks later which was soundly defeated at Springfield, effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey.Fleming, p. 232, 302 Meanwhile, American general Benedict Arnold had defected to the British, and he conspired to betray the key American fortress of West Point by surrendering it to the enemy. The plot was foiled when British spy master John André was captured, so Arnold fled to British lines in New York. He attempted to justify his betrayal by appealing to Loyalist public opinion, but the Patriots strongly condemned him as a coward and turncoat.Willard M. Wallace, Traitorous Hero: The Life and Fortunes of Benedict Arnold (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1954), p. 263, 270\n\nThe war to the west of the Appalachians was largely confined to skirmishing and raids. An expedition of militia was halted due to adverse weather in February 1778 which had set out to destroy British military supplies in settlements along the Cuyahoga River.Downes, Council Fires, 211; Nester, Frontier War, 194; Nelson, Man of Distinction, 101. Later in the year, a second campaign was undertaken to seize the Illinois Country from the British. The Americans captured Kaskaskia on July 4 and then secured Vincennes, although Vincennes was recaptured by Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit. In early 1779, the Americans counterattacked by undertaking a risky winter march, and they secured the surrender of the British at Vincennes, taking Hamilton prisoner.James, James Alton, ed. George Rogers Clark Papers. 2 vols. Originally published 1912–1926. Reprinted New York: AMS Press, 1972. , p. 144-48Lowell Hayes Harrison, George Rogers Clark and the War in the West (2001).\n\nOn May 25, 1780, the British launched an expedition into Kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the Gulf coast. The expedition met with only limited success, though hundreds of settlers were killed or captured.Grenier, John. The First Way of War: American War Making on the Frontier, 1607–1814. Cambridge University Press, 2005. ., p. 159. Grenier argues that \"The slaughter the Indians and rangers perpetrated was unprecedented.\" The Americans responded with a major offensive along the Mad River in August which met with some success, but it did little to abate the Indian raids on the frontier.Nelson, Larry L.

(hardcover). p. 118 French militia attempted to capture Detroit, but it ended in disaster when Miami Indians ambushed and defeated the gathered troops on November 5. The war in the west had become a stalemate; the Americans did not have the manpower to simultaneously defeat the hostile Indian tribes and occupy their land.Scaggs, David Curtis, ed.

Madison: The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1977. , p. 132\n\nWar in the South (1778–1781) \n\nThe British turned their attention to conquering the South in 1778, despite their defeat at Saratoga. Prominent Loyalists with great influence in LondonRitcheson, C.; \"Loyalist Influence on British Policy Toward the United States After the American Revolution\"; Eighteenth-Century Studies; Vol. 7, No. 1; Autumn, 1973; p. 6. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3031609 Jstor link] had convinced them that Loyalist support was high in the South and that a campaign there would inspire an uprising, and the British centered their strategy upon this thinking.Wickwire; Cornwallis, the American Adventure; p.315.[http://www.clements.umich.edu/ \"Letter from Cornwallis to Clinton, August 6th 1780\"], Clinton Papers; Clements Library, University of Michigan. A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco-Spanish fleets.Henry Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).\n\nOn April 19, 1778, three row galleys of the Georgia Navy engaged, defeated, and captured a Royal Navy brigantine, an armed British East Florida provincial sloop, and an armed brig.\n\nOn December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from New York captured Savannah, and British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support., p. 46-47 There was a promising initial turnout in early 1779, but then a large Loyalist militia was defeated at Kettle Creek on February 14 and they had to recognize their dependence upon the British. The British, however, defeated Patriot militia at Brier Creek on March 3,Morrill (1993), p. 48-50 and then launched an abortive assault on Charleston, South Carolina. The operation became notorious for its high degree of looting by British troops, enraging both Loyalists and Patriot colonists., p. 112\n\nIn October, a combined Franco-American effort failed to recapture Savannah.Hibbert, C.; Rebels and Redcoats; p. 246 In 1780, Henry Clinton moved against Charleston, capturing it on May 12. With few losses of their own, the British took 5,266 prisoners,[http://www.carolana.com/SC/Revolution/revolution_siege_of_charleston.html], The American Revolution in South Carolina effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south.John W.

In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias who effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in Fairfield County,Shelton, Kenneth, All That Dare Oppose Them: The Whig Victory at Mobley's Meeting House, June 1780, (2005) Lincolnton, York County,Michael C. Scoggins, The Day It Rained Militia: Huck's Defeat and the Revolution in the South Carolina Backcountry, May–July 1780 (Charleston: The History Press, 2005) Stanly County,O. C. Stonestreet IV, The Battle of Colson's Mill: Death Knell of the Carolina Tories, (Createspace Publishing, 2014) pp.67–70.  and Lancaster County.\n\nCongress appointed Horatio Gates, victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. He suffered a major defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.Hugh F. Rankin, North Carolina in the American Revolution (1996). The British attempted to subjugate the countryside, and Patriot militia continued to fight against them, so Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north., p. 202 This wing of Cornwallis' army was virtually destroyed on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas. Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina.Buchanan, p. 241 In the interim, Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate, Nathanael Greene.Buchanan, p. 275\n\nGreene was unable to confront the British directly, so he dispatched a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops.Buchanan, p. 292 Morgan then defeated the cream of the British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781 at Cowpens.Buchanan, p. 326 Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support,Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion; 1783 but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted war of attrition.\n\nBy March, Greene's army had increased in size enough that he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15; Greene was beaten, but Cornwallis' army suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining than the British had previously expected.Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000). Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement, leaving the Patriots in control of the interior of the Carolinas and Georgia.\n\nGreene then proceeded to reclaim the South. The American troops suffered a reversal at Hobkirk's Hill on April 25;Greene, Francis Vinton D. General Greene, Appleton and Company 1893, p. 241 nonetheless, they continued to dislodge strategic British posts in the area, capturing Fort Watson and Fort Motte., p. 162 Augusta was the last major British outpost in the South outside of Charleston and Savannah, but the Americans reclaimed possession of it on June 6. A British force clashed with American troops at Eutaw Springs on September 8 in a final effort to stop Greene, but the British casualties were so high that they withdrew to Charleston., p. 221 Minor skirmishes continued in the Carolinas until the end of the war, and British troops were effectively confined to Charleston and Savannah for the remainder of the conflict.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats: The American Revolutionary War, London, 2003\n\nBritish defeat in America (1781) \n\nCornwallis had discovered that the majority of American supplies in the Carolinas were passing through Virginia, and he had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade. Cornwallis believed that a successful campaign there would cut supplies to Greene's army and precipitate a collapse of American resistance in the South. Clinton strongly opposed the plan, favoring a campaign farther north in the Chesapeake Bay region.Cornwallis; An Answer to Sir Henry Clinton's Narrative. Note: Cornwallis wrote this pamphlet shortly after the war in explanation of his actions. Lord Germain wrote to Cornwallis to approve his plan and neglected to include Clinton in the decision-making, even though Clinton was Cornwallis' superior officer,Cornwallis Correspondence, [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/default.htm Public Record Office] and Cornwallis then decided to move into Virginia without informing Clinton.Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy which followed the surrender at Yorktown. Clinton, however, had failed to construct a coherent strategy for British operations in 1781,, p. 29 owing to his difficult relationship with his naval counterpart Marriot Arbuthnot., p. 267-275\n\nFollowing the calamitous operations at Newport and Savannah, French planners realized that closer cooperation with the Americans was required to achieve success., p. 247-248 The French fleet led by the Comte de Grasse had received discretionary orders from Paris to assist joint efforts in the north if naval support was needed.Grainger, p. 40Dull, p. 241 Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau discussed their options. Washington pushed for an attack on New York, while Rochambeau preferred a strike in Virginia where the British were less well-established and thus easier to defeat.Ketchum, p. 139 Franco-American movements around New York caused Clinton a great deal of anxiety, fearing an attack on the city. His instructions were vague to Cornwallis during this time, rarely forming explicit orders. However, Clinton did instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base and to transfer troops to the north to defend New York.Grainger, p. 43-44 Cornwallis dug in at Yorktown and awaited the Royal Navy.Michael Cecere, Great Things are Expected from the Virginians: Virginia in the American Revolution (2009).\n\nWashington still favored an assault on New York, but he acquiesced to the French when they opted to send their fleet to their preferred target of Yorktown. In August, the combined Franco-American army moved south to coordinate with de Grasse in defeating Cornwallis., p. 101 The British lacked sufficient naval resources to effectively counter the French, but they dispatched a fleet under Thomas Graves to assist Cornwallis and attempt to gain naval dominance. On September 5, the French fleet decisively defeated Graves, giving the French control of the seas around Yorktown and cutting off Cornwallis from reinforcements and relief., p. 110 Despite the continued urging of his subordinates,Ketchum, p. 205\n\nCornwallis made no attempt to break out and engage the Franco-American army before it had established siege works, expecting that reinforcements would arrive from New York,, p. 362 and the Franco-American army laid siege to Yorktown on September 28.Ketchum, p. 214 Cornwallis continued to think that relief was imminent from Clinton, and he abandoned his outer defenses which were immediately occupied by American troops—serving to hasten his subsequent defeat., p. 337 The British then failed in an attempt to break out of the siege across the river at Gloucester Point when a storm hit., p. 237 Cornwallis and his subordinates were under increasing bombardment and facing dwindling supplies; they agreed that their situation was untenable and negotiated a surrender on October 17, 1781,, p. 16 and 7,685 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans.Greene, pp. 307–308 The same day as the surrender, 6,000 troops under Clinton had departed New York, sailing to relieve Yorktown.Ketchum, p. 241Richard Ferrie, The World Turned Upside Down: George Washington and the Battle of Yorktown (1999).\n\nNorth Ministry collapses \n\nThe North government had gained support in Parliament after the British successes at Newport and Charleston,Rodger, N.A.M.

While peace negotiations were being undertaken, British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives. Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace, as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt, and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there. He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire, though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778. Negotiations soon began in Paris.\n\nThe Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as spoils of war,Rideau, Roger. A Brief History of Canada. Facts on File. p. 79. a proposal that was dropped when Shelburne accepted American demands for recognition of independence. On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations.Fiske, John [http://cupid.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/het/fiske/critical.rtf The Critical Period of American History 1783–1789]  Boston, Houghton Mifflin (1896), via unimelb.edu.au— accessed 2008-01-11 Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the area north of the Ohio River, below which an Indian barrier state would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" Northwest Ohio Quarterly 61#2–4 (1989): 46–63.\n\nThe Americans skirted their allies, recognizing that more favorable terms would be found in London. They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782–1783: Vision and Reality.\" International History Review 5#3 (1983): 322–345.

However, the subsequent tension erupted into conflicts between the Indians and the young United States, the largest being the Northwest Indian War.Benn (1993), p. 17.

As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as smallpox claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a smallpox epidemic broke out throughout North America, killing 40 people in Boston alone. Historian Joseph Ellis suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops inoculated against the disease was one of his most important decisions.Ellis (2004), p. 87.\n\nBetween 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service.Howard H. Peckham, ed., The Toll of Independence: Engagements and Battle Casualties of the American Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974). Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the British, mostly in the prison ships in New York Harbor. If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the American Civil War. Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone. The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.American dead and wounded: Shy, pp. 249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p. 849.\n\nThe French suffered approximately 7,000 total dead throughout the conflict; of those, 2,112 were killed in combat in the American theaters of war.\n\nThe Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.\n\nBritish and allies \n\nBritish returns in 1783 listed 43,633 rank and file deaths across the British Armed Forces.[https://books.google.com/books?id\np7T9O3aNmVoC&pgPA199&dq\nAnnual+register+43,633&hlen&sa\nX&eiHmfKVOSMGKrIsATz14K4DQ&ved\n0CB8Q6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nAnnual%20register%2043%2C633&ffalse Annual Register, 1783] (1785), pp. 199–200.

Extrapolations based upon this list puts British Army losses in the area of at least 4,000 killed or died of wounds. Approximately 7,774 Germans died in British service in addition to 4,888 deserters; of the former, it is estimated 1,800 were killed in combat.\n\nAround 171,000 sailors served in the Royal Navy during the war; approximately a quarter of whom had been pressed into service.

The greatest killer at sea was scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. It was not until 1795 that scurvy was eradicated from the Royal Navy after the Admiralty declared lemon juice and sugar were to be issued among the standard daily rations of sailors.Vale, Brian (2008). \"The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: a Challenge to Current Orthodoxy\".

The American Revolution 1774–1783. Osprey Publishing (2002) . p. 82 and the free white population enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world. The Royal Navy enforced a naval blockade during the war to financially cripple the colonies, however, this proved unsuccessful; 90% of the population worked in farming, not in coastal trade, and, as such, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade.Greene and Pole, eds., A Companion to the American Revolution (2004) chapters 42, 48\n\nCongress had immense difficulties throughout the conflict to efficiently finance the war effort.Curtis P. Nettels, The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815 (1962) pp 23–44 As the circulation of hard currency declined, the Americans had to rely on loans from American merchants and bankers, France, Spain and the Netherlands, saddling the young nation with crippling debts. Congress attempted to remedy this by printing vast amounts of paper money and bills of credit to raise revenue. The effect was disastrous; inflation skyrocketed, and the paper money became virtually worthless. The inflation spawned a popular phrase that anything of little value was \"not worth a continental\".\"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx Not worth a continental] \", \"Creating the United States\", Library of Congress.

The United States finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s, when Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton secured legislation by which the national government assumed all of the state debts, and, in addition, created a national bank and a funding system based on tariffs and bond issues that paid off the foreign debts.\n\nBritain spent around £80 million and ended with a national debt of £250 million, (£ in today's money), generating a yearly interest of £9.5 million annually. The debts piled upon that which it had already accumulated from the Seven Years' War. Due to wartime taxation upon the British populace, the tax for the average Briton amounted to approximately four shillings in every pound.Conway, Stephen. The War of American Independence 1775–1783. Publisher: E. Arnold (1995) . 280 pages.\n\nThe French spent approximately 1.3 billion livres on aiding the Americans, accumulating a national debt of 3.315.1 billion livres by 1783 on war costs.Conway (1995) p. 242 Unlike Britain, which had a very efficient taxation system,Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1987) p. 81, 119 the French tax system was highly unstable, eventually leading to a financial crisis in 1786.Marston (2002) p. 82 The debts contributed to a worsening fiscal crisis that ultimately begat the French Revolution at the end of the century.Tombs (2007) p. 179 The debt continued to spiral; on the eve of the French Revolution, the national debt had skyrocketed to 12 billion livres.\n\nSpain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million reales in 1778 to over 700 million in 1779.Lynch, John. Bourbon Spain 1700–1808. Publisher: Oxford (1989) . p. 326 Spain more easily disposed of her debts unlike her French ally, partially due to the massive increase in silver mining in her American colonies; production increased approximately 600% in Mexico, and by 250% in Peru and Bolivia.Castillero Calvo, Alfredo (2004).

Theoretically, Britain had the advantage, however, many factors inhibited the procurement of a large army.\n\nArmed Forces \n\nRecruitment \n\nIn 1775, the standing British Army, exclusive of militia, comprised 45,123 men worldwide, made up of 38,254 infantry and 6,869 cavalry. The Army had approximately eighteen regiments of foot, some 8,500 men, stationed in North America.Clode, Charles Matthew (1869), \"The Military Forces of the Crown: Their Administration and Government\", London, J Murray, p. 268. Note: Figures include the 41st regiment of invalids, but not the 20 independent companies on garrison duty. Troops in India were under the control of the East India Company, and did not become part of the British Army until 1858. Standing armies had played a key role in the purge of the Long Parliament in 1648, the maintenance of a military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell, and the overthrow of James II,Rodger, N.A.M (2004). The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815. Penguin Group. , p. 137 and, as such, the Army had been deliberately kept small in peacetime to prevent abuses of power by the King. Despite this, eighteenth century armies were not easy guests, and were regarded with scorn and contempt by the press and public of the New and Old World alike, derided as enemies of liberty. An expression ran in the Navy; \"A messmate before a shipmate, a shipmate before a stranger, a stranger before a dog, a dog before a soldier\".Belcher, Henry (1911), \"The First American Civil War; First Period, 1775–1778, with chapters on the Continental or Revolutionary army and on the forces of the Crown\", Volume 1, London Macmillan, p. 250, 258\n\nParliament suffered chronic difficulties in obtaining sufficient manpower,War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:992–1008, passim and found it impossible to fill the quotas they had set.War Officer Papers, 4:275, Jenkinson to Clinton, 5 Dec. 1780 The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A Private infantryman was paid a wage of just 8d. per day,9th Report on Public Accounts (1783) in 39 House of Commons Journal, H.M. Stationery Office, 1803, pp. 325–344 the same pay as for a New Model Army infantryman, 130 years earlier.Plant, David, \"The New Model Army\", BCW Project, http://bcw-project.org/military/new-model-army, Retrieved 9 June 2017 The rate of pay in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits,Fortescue, Volume III, p. 41 as service was nominally for life.Owen, Captain Wheeler (1914), \"The War Office Past and Present\", Methuen & Co. London, p. 90\n\nTo entice people to enrol, Parliament offered a bounty of £1.10s for every recruit.War Office Papers, 3:5, Harvey to Elliot, 10 March 1775 As the war dragged on, Parliament became desperate for manpower; criminals were offered military service to escape legal penalties, and deserters were pardoned if they re-joined their units.Clode, Volume II, p.13-14 After the defeat at Saratoga, Parliament doubled the bounty to £3,Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition (London, 1763–1800), Volume XIII, p. 273-280 and increased it again the following year, to £3.3s, as well as expanding the age limit from 17–45 to 16–50 years of age.Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition, Volume XIII, p. 316-317\n\nImpressment, essentially conscription by the \"press gang\", was a favored recruiting method, though it was unpopular with the public, leading many to enlist in local militias to avoid regular service.War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to John Livesey and E. Brewer, 13 Apr. 1779 Attempts were made to draft such levies, much to the chagrin of the militia commanders.War Office Papers, 1:996, Sir William Codrington to Barrington, December 1778 Competition between naval and army press gangs, and even between rival ships or regiments, frequently resulted in brawls between the gangs in order to secure recruits for their unit.War Office Papers. 1:998, Lieutenant General Parker to Barrington, 19 June 1778. Men would maim themselves to avoid the press gangs,War Office Papers, 1:1005, Oughton to Jenkinson, 27 May 1779 while many deserted at the first opportunity.Andrews, Charles McLean (1912), \"Guide to the materials for American history, to 1783, in the Public record office of Great Britain\", Washington, D.C., Carnegie institution of Washington, Volume II, p. 32 Pressed men were militarily unreliable; regiments with large numbers of such men were deployed to garrisons such as Gibraltar or the West Indies, purely to increase the difficulty in successfully deserting.War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to Amherst, 26 Oct. 1779\n\nBy 1781, the Army numbered approximately 121,000 men globally, 48,000 of whom were stationed throughout the Americas. Of the 171,000 sailors who served in the Royal Navy throughout the conflict, around a quarter were pressed. Interestingly, this same proportion, approximately 42,000 men, deserted during the conflict.Mackesy (1964), pp. 6, 176 (British seamen) At its height, the Navy had 94 ships-of-the-line,Jonathan Dull, A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution (Yale University Press, 1985), p. 110. 104 frigatesWinfield, Rif, British Warships in the Age of Sail: 1714–1792 (Seaforth Publishing, 2007)  and 37 sloopsWinfield, Rif, British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714–1792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates (Seaforth Publishing, 2007) in service.\n\nLoyalists and Hessians \n\nIn 1775, Britain unsuccessfully attempted to secure 20,000 mercenaries from Russia,Colonial Office Papers. Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:92, Dartmouth to Howe, 5 Sept. 1775 and the use of the Scots Brigade from the Dutch Republic,Edler 2001, pp. 28–32 such was the shortage of manpower. Parliament managed to negotiate treaties with the princes of German states for large sums of money, in exchange for mercenary troops. In total, 29,875 troops were hired for British service from six German states; Brunswick (5,723), Hesse-Kassel (16,992), Hesse-Hannau (2,422), Ansbach-Bayreuth (2,353), Waldeck-Pyrmont (1,225) and Anhalt-Zerbst (1,160).Lowell, Edward J (1884), \"The Hessians and the other German Auxiliaries of Great Britain in the Revolutionary War\", Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, Chapter II King George III, who also ruled Hanover as a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire, was approached by Parliament to loan the government Hanoverian soldiers for service in the war. Hanover supplied 2,365 men in five battalions, however, the lease agreement permitted them to only be used in Europe.Knesebeck, Ernst von dem (1845), \"Geschichte de churhannoverschen Truppen in Gibraltar, Menorca und Ostindien\", Published by Im Verlage der Helwingschen Hof-Buchhandlung. Note: The strength of a Hanoverian battalion is listed as 473 men\n\nWithout any major allies, the manpower shortage became critical when France and Spain entered the war, forcing a major diversion of military resources from the Americas. Recruiting adequate numbers of Loyalist militia in America proved difficult due to high Patriot activity.Black (2001), p. 59. On militia see Boatner (1974), p. 707, and Weigley (1973), ch. 2. To bolster numbers, the British promised freedom and grants of land to slaves who fought for them. Approximately 25,000 Loyalists fought for the British throughout the war,Savas and Dameron (2006), p. xli and provided some of the best troops in the British service;Buchanan, 327 the British Legion, a mixed regiment of 250 dragoons and 200 infantryBabits, page 46, \"British Legion Infantry strength at Cowpens was between 200 and 271 enlisted men\". However, this statement is referenced to a note on pages 175–176, which says, \"The British Legion infantry at Cowpens is usually considered to have had about 200–250 men, but returns for the 25 December 1780 muster show only 175. Totals obtained by Cornwallis, dated 15 January, show that the whole legion had 451 men, but approximately 250 were dragoons\". There would therefore appear to be no evidence for putting the total strength of the five British Legion Light Infantry companies at more than 200. commanded by Banastre Tarleton, gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies, especially in the South.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23517100?loginSuccesstrue&seq\n1#page_scan_tab_contents Review by: Hugh F. Rankin; Reviewed Work: The Green Dragoon: The Lives of Banastre Tarleton and Mary Robinson by Robert D. Bass, The North Carolina Historical Review, Vol. 34, No. 4 (October, 1957), pp. 548–550]\n\nLeadership \n\nBritain had a difficult time appointing a determined senior military leadership in America. Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, due to unwillingness to take sides in the war.Ketchum (1997), p. 76 Admiral Augustus Keppel similarly opposed a command, stating; \"I cannot draw the sword in such a cause\". The Earl of Effingham resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.Ketchum (1997), p. 77\n\nAs was the case in many European armies, except the Prussian Army, officers in British service could purchase commissions to ascend the ranks.Duffy, Christopher. The Military Experience in the Age of Reason. p. 61. . Despite repeated attempts by Parliament to suppress it, the practise was common in the Army.Forteseue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 34 Values of commissions varied, but were usually in line with social and military prestige, for example, regiments such as the Guards commanded the highest prices. The lower ranks often regarded the treatment to high-ranking commissions by wealthier officers as \"plums for [their] consumption\".Belcher, Volume I, p. 270 Wealthy individuals lacking any formal military education, or practical experience, often found their way into positions of high responsibility, diluting the effectiveness of a regiment. Though Royal authority had forbade the practise since 1711, it was still permitted for infants to hold commissions. Young boys, often orphans of deceased wealthy officers, were taken from their schooling and placed in positions of responsibility within regiments.Duncan, Volume II, p. 15\n\nLogistics \n\nLogistical organization of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps existed in the modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire.Duncan, Francis (1879). \"History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery\", Volume 1. J. Murray, p. 131, 303, 309 No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who followed the army.Sergeant Lamb, \"Journal of the American War\", p. 75 Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.Duncan, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Volume 2, p. 15\n\nThe heavy personal equipment and wool uniform of the regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement.Burgoyne, State of the Expedition, p. 148 During the Battle of Monmouth in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°F (37.8°C) and is said to have claimed more lives through heat stroke than through actual combat. The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the Land Pattern Musket. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel.Lloyd, Ernest Marsh (1908), Review of the History of Infantry, p. 155 British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign.Howe, William, Orderly Book, p. 116 Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations,Howe, Orderly Book, 20 June 1777, p. 3. which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.Trevelyan, Volume III, p. 6; Volume IV, p. 158\n\nEvery battalion in America had organized its own rifle company by the end of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the Baker Rifle in 1801.Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 83. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the flash pan,Sawyer, Charles Winthrop (1910), \"Firearms in American History\", p. 99 while heavy rain could soak the paper cartridge, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire.Trevelyan, Volume IV, p. 224 Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: \"Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog\".Trevelyan, Volume IV, p.34\n\nProvisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain.Minute Book of a Board of General Officers of the British Army in New York, 1781. New York Historical Society Collections, 1916, p. 81. The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land.Black (2001), p. 14 Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed.Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 7, 52 After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. The food that could be bought in America was purchased at vastly inflated prices.Minute Book (1916), p. 81 Soldiers stationed in the West Indies perhaps suffered the worst; the garrison commander of Tobago, Barbados, and Antigua frequently complained of the near-total lack of regular supply from Britain, and the food that could be bought was so expensive that the pay of the troops was inadequate to cover the costs.War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:51, Graham to Jenkinson, 13 September and 23 November 1779; 1:51, Vaughan to Jenkinson, 2 November 1780\n\nFood supplies were frequently in terrible condition, infested with mould, weevils, worms, and maggots.Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:118, Chamier to Robinson, 9 Nov 1776 Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats,Treasury Papers, 64:103, Day to Robinson, 22 Aug. 1777 and their containers were too fragile to sustain a long ocean voyage or the rigors of campaigning.Treasury Papers, 64:200, Marsh to Navy Board, 17 Dec 1779 The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil.Treasury Papers, 64:120, Paumier to Robinson, 20 June & 7 August 1779 British troops stationed in America were often on the verge of starvation.Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:201, Wier to Robinson, 14 September 1780\n\nLife at sea was little better. Sailors and passengers were issued a daily food ration, largely consisting of hardtack and beer. The hardtack was often infested by weevils and was so tough that it earned the nicknames \"molar breakers\" and \"worm castles\", and it sometimes had to be broken up with cannon shot. Meat supplies often spoiled on long voyages.Lowell, Edward J and Andrews, Raymond J (June 15, 1997) \"The Hessians in the Revolutionary War\", Corner House Pub, , p. 56 The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables gave rise to scurvy, one of the biggest killers at sea. Rum was issued as part of a daily ration and was a popular drink among soldiers and sailors alike, often mixed with fresh water to make grog.Blue, Anthony Dias (2004). The Complete Book of Spirits : A Guide to Their History, Production, and Enjoyment. HarperCollins. , p. 77\n\nDiscipline \n\nDiscipline was harsh in the armed forces, and the lash was used to punish even trivial offences—and not used sparingly.Howe, (Sir) William, Orderly Book, edited by B. F. Stevens (London, 1890), pp. 263, 288 For instance, two redcoats received 1,000 lashes each for robbery during the Saratoga campaign,Burgoyne, John, Orderly Book, edited by E. B. O'Callaghan (Albany, 1860), p. 74. while another received 800 lashes for striking a superior officer.Howe, Orderly Book, pp 263, 288 Flogging was a common punishment in the Royal Navy and came to be associated with the stereotypical hardiness of sailors.\"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]\". National Maritime Museum.\n\nDespite the harsh discipline, a distinct lack of self-discipline pervaded all ranks of the British forces. Soldiers had an intense passion for gambling, reaching such excesses that troops would often wager their own uniforms.Lamb, Memoir, p. 74 Many drank heavily, and this was not exclusive to the lower ranks; William Howe was said to have seen many \"crapulous mornings\" while campaigning in New York. John Burgoyne drank heavily on a nightly basis towards the end of the Saratoga campaign. The two generals were also reported to have found solace with the wives of subordinate officers to ease the stressful burdens of command.Riedesel, Mrs. General, Letters and Journals, translated from the original German by W. L. Stone (Albany, 1867) p. 125 During the Philadelphia campaign, British officers deeply offended local Quakers by entertaining their mistresses in the houses where they had been quartered.Stedman, Charles, History of the American War (London, 1794), Volume I, p. 309 Some reports indicated that British troops were generally scrupulous in their treatment of non-combatants.Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 35 This is contrasted diaries of Hessian soldiers, who recorded their disapproval of British conduct towards the colonists, such as the destruction of property and the execution of prisoners.Steven Schwamenfeld. \"The Foundation of British Strength: National Identity and the Common British Soldier.\" Ph.D. diss., Florida State University 2007, p. 123-124\n\nThe presence of Hessian soldiers caused considerable anxiety among the colonists, both Patriot and Loyalist, who viewed them as brutal mercenaries.Schwamenfeld (2007), p.123-124 British soldiers were often contemptuous in their treatment of Hessian troops, despite orders from General Howe that \"the English should treat the Germans as brothers\". The order only began to have any real effect when the Hessians learned to speak a minimal degree of English, which was seen as a prerequisite for the British troops to accord them any respect.Schwamenfeld (2007), p. 123\n\nDuring peacetime, the Army's idleness led to it being riddled with corruption and inefficiency, resulting in many administrative difficulties once campaigning began.Clayton, Anthony (2007). The British Officer: Leading the Army from 1660 to the Present. Routledge. , p. 65\n\nStrategic deficiencies \n\nThe British leadership soon discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists, causing a sudden re-think in British planning. The ineffective initial response of British military and civil officials to the onset of the rebellion had allowed the advantage to shift to the colonists, as British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony. A microcosm of these shortcomings were evident at the Battle of Bunker Hill. It took ten hours for the British leadership to respond following the sighting of the Americans on the Charlestown Peninsula, giving the colonists ample time to reinforce their defenses.French, pp. 263–265 Rather than opt for a simple flanking attack that would have rapidly succeeded with minimal loss,Frothingham, p. 155 the British decided on repeated frontal attacks. The results were telling; the British suffered 1,054 casualties of a force of around 3,000 after repeated frontal assaults.Frothingham pp. 191, 194 The British leadership had nevertheless remained excessively optimistic, believing that just two regiments could suppress the rebellion in Massachusetts.Frothingham, p. 156Ferling, 2015, p. 127-129\n\nDebate persists over whether a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome. Ferling argues that the odds were so long, the defeat of Britain was nothing short of a miracle.John E. Ferling, Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence (2009), pp. 562–77. Ellis, however, considers that the odds always favored the Americans, and questions whether a British victory by any margin was realistic. Ellis argues that the British squandered their only opportunities for a decisive success in 1777, and that the strategic decisions undertaken by William Howe underestimated the challenges posed by the Americans. Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory \"would never come again\". Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.[http://history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch04.htm Richard W. Stewart, ed., American Military History Volume 1 The United States Army And The Forging Of A Nation, 1775–1917\" (2005)] ch 4  \"The Winning of Independence, 1777–1783\" (2005), p. 103.\n\nWilliam Howe \n\nHistorians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans. Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory. At Long Island, Howe failed to even attempt an encirclement of Washington,Adams, Charles Francis, [https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric18951896jame#page/668/mode/1up \"Battle of Long Island\"], in American Historical Review (1895–1896), pp. 668–669. and actively restrained his subordinates from mounting an aggressive pursuit of the defeated American army. At White Plains, he refused to engage Washington's vulnerable army, and instead concentrated his efforts upon a hill which offered the British no strategic advantage. After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army. Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats, Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. The decision left Burgoyne precariously isolated, and left the Americans confounded at the decision. Alden argues Howe may have been motivated by political opportunism; if Burgoyne was successful, he would receive the credit for a decisive victory, and not Howe. However, the confusion was further compounded by the lack of explicit and contradictory instructions from London., p. 126 When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so confused Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the Battle of Brandywine, and again after the Battle of Germantown. At the Battle of White Marsh, Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear, and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides. While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war. Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.Frothingham pp. 152–153Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005). Empire City: New York Through the Centuries. Columbia University Press. , p. 20 During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns.Colonial Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:93, Howe to Dartmouth, 1st December 1775  Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 7 June and 7 July 1776A View of the Evidence (London, 1783), p. 13\n\nDuring the winter of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the Battle of Trenton, and the concurrent Battle of Princeton.Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57 While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 30 Nov 1776 Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287\n\nClinton and Cornwallis \n\nIn 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at Camden, Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the Battle of Kings Mountain, and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the Battle of Cowpens. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support. Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000). As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive war of attrition.Trevelyan, Sir George Otto (1914). George the Third and Charles Fox: The Concluding Part of The American Revolution. New York and elsewhere: Longmans, Green and Co. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. ., p. 221\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North. London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction. Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown. Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,, p. 29 owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to sally out and engage before siege lines could be erected,Wickwire, Franklin and Mary (1970). Cornwallis: The American Adventure. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. . p. 362 despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers. Expecting relief to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. ., p. 337 These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. , p. 16\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778 That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778 Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779 By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780\n\nCampaign issues \n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306 The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict,Rossman, Vadim (2016), \"Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation\", Taylor & Francis, , p. 2 yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved 10 June 2017 Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was agrarian, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.\n\nThe need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in Scotland and Ireland.Black (2001), p. 14. For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.Wilson, David K (2005). The Southern Strategy: Britain's Conquest of South Carolina and Georgia, 1775–1780. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. . . p. 112 Neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Patriots when brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs across the Carolinas in the later stages of the war.Black (2001), pp. 14–16 (Harsh methods), pp. 35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p. 16 (neutrals into revolutionaries). Conversely, Loyalists were often emboldened when Patriots resorted to intimidating suspected Tories, such as destroying property or tarring and feathering.Leonard Woods Larabee, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) pp 164–65Calhoon, Robert M. The Loyalists in Revolutionary America, 1760–1781 (1973) The vastness of the American countryside and the limited manpower available meant that the British could never simultaneously defeat the Americans and occupy captured territory. One British statesman described the attempt as \"like trying to conquer a map\".Curtis, \"The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion\n\nWealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London and were successful in convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown.Lorenzo Sabine, [https://books.google.com/books?vid\nOCLC00425953&idQjUNAAAAIAAJ&printsec\ntitlepage#vonepage&q\n%22In%20nearly%20every%20loyalist%20letter%22&ffalse Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution], Vol. I (1864) p. 48; Sabine adds they were certainly wrong. Consequently, British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists, which never transpired on the scale required. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots)Greene and Pole (1999), p. 235 and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780. The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars,Black (2001), p. 12. which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances.Black (2001), p. 13–14. The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.\n\nUpon the entry of France and Spain into the conflict, the British were forced to severely limit the number of troops and warships that they sent to North America in order to defend other key territories and the British mainland. As a result, King George III abandoned any hope of subduing America militarily while he had a European war to contend with.Ferling (2007), p. 294 The small size of Britain's army left them unable to concentrate their resources primarily in one theater as they had done in the Seven Years' War, leaving them at a critical disadvantage. The British were compelled to disperse troops from the Americas to Europe and the East Indies, and these forces were unable to assist one other as a result, precariously exposing them to defeat. In North America, the immediate strategic focus of the French, Spanish, and British shifted to Jamaica,Dull, (1985) p. 244 whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the economy of the Thirteen Colonies combined.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Britain had lost some of her most populous colonies. However, the economic effects of the loss were negligible in the long-term, and she became a global superpower just 32 years after the end of the conflict.Tellier, L.-N. (2009). Urban World History: an Economic and Geographical Perspective. Quebec: PUQ. p. 463. .\n\nPatriots \n\nThe Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.Pole and Greene, eds.  Companion to the American Revolution, ch. 36–39.\n\nMotivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the Battle of Bennington, the Battles of Saratoga and even defeats such as the Battle of GermantownTrevelyan, p. 249. proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.Ketchum (1997), pp. 405–48.\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as George Washington, Horatio Gates, Charles Lee, Richard Montgomery and Francis Marion all had military experience with the British Army during the French and Indian War. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the Revolutionary War Drill Manual.Philander D. Chase. \"Steuben, Friedrich Wilhelm von\";\n[http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00855.html American National Biography Online (2000)].\nAccessed January 29, 2015. When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the Battle of Monmouth.Ferling, John (2007), pp. 294–95\"\n\nWhen the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.\n\nSeeking to coordinate military efforts, the Continental Congress established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.\n\nThree current branches of the United States Military trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the United States Army comes from the Continental Army, formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The United States Navy recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the Continental Navy.  And the United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the war, formed  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.Crocker (2006), p. 51. At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard privateers during the war. The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships. John Paul Jones became the first great American naval hero, capturing HMS Drake on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.Higginbotham (1983), pp. 331–46.\n\nArmies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable, on the American side, to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities; and, on the British side, to the difficulty of transporting troops across the Atlantic, as well as the dependence on local supplies, which the Patriots tried to cut off. The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,Boatner (1974), p. 264. and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.Duffy, Christopher (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id\nm1aRAgAAQBAJ&pgPA13 Military Experience in the Age of Reason]. London: Routledge. . p. 13. In the original 1987 edition, p. 17. By comparison, Duffy notes that in an era when European rulers were generally revising their forces downward, in favor of a size that could be most effectively controlled (the very different perspective of mass conscript armies came later, during the French Revolutionary and then the Napoleonic Wars), the largest army that Frederick the Great ever led into battle was 65,000 men (at Prague in 1757), and at other times he commanded between 23,000 and 50,000 men, considering the latter the most effective number.\n\nAfrican Americans \n\nAfrican Americans—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to Patriot masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord Dunmore's Proclamation. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from Saint-Domingue with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp. 64–69.\n\nTens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73 This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.Kolchin, p.73 Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.Cassadra Pybus, \"Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution\", William and Mary Quarterly (2005) 62#2 pp: 243–264. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491601 in JSTOR]\n\nAmerican Indians \n\nMost American Indians east of the Mississippi River were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the Iroquois tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.Greene and Pole (1999), p. 393; Boatner (1974), p. 545. The powerful Iroquois Confederacy was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga nations sided with the British. Members of the Mohawk nation fought on both sides. Many Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the Sullivan Expedition on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders Joseph Louis Cook and Joseph Brant sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.\n\nEarly in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.\n\nCreek and Seminole allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the Broad River in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined Thomas Brown's raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the Siege of Savannah. Many Indians were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, Chickasaws, and Choctaws fought in major battles such as the Battle of Fort Charlotte, the Battle of Mobile, and the Siege of Pensacola.\n\nRace and class \n\nPybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots. The British took some 12,000 at the end of the war; of these 8000 remained in slavery. Including those who left during the war, a total of about 8000 to 10,000 slaves gained freedom.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491601 Cassandra Pybus, \"Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution\"], William and Mary Quarterly 2005 62#2: 243–264. About 4000 freed slaves went to Nova Scotia and 1200 blacks remained slaves.John N. Grant, \"Black Immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776–1815.\" Journal of Negro History (1973): 253–270. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716777 in JSTOR]James W. St G. Walker, The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783–1870 (1992).\n\nBaller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" Journal of Family History (2006) 31(1): 28–44. . Fulltext: online in EBSCO.\n\nMcDonnell (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, the middling yeomen (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.Michael A. McDonnell, \"Class War: Class Struggles During the American Revolution in Virginia\", William and Mary Quarterly 2006 63(2): 305–344.  Fulltext: online at History Cooperative.
