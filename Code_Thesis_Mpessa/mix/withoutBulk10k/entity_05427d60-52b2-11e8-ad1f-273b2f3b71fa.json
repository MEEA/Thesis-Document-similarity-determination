  "textBody" : "GnuCash is an accounting program that implements a double-entry bookkeeping system. It was initially aimed at developing capabilities similar to Intuit, Inc.'s Quicken application, but also has features for small business accounting. Recent development has been focused on adapting to modern desktop support-library requirements.\n\nGnuCash is part of the GNU Project, and runs on Linux, GNU, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, macOS, and other Unix-like platforms. A Microsoft Windows (2000 or newer) port was made available starting with the 2.2.0 series.\n\nHistory \n\nProgramming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998. Small Business Accounting was added in 2001. A Mac installer became available in 2004. A Windows port was released in 2007.\n\nIn May 2012, the development of GnuCash for Android was announced.http://www.codinguser.com/2012/05/gnucash-mobile/ This is an expense-tracking companion app for GnuCash, as opposed to a stand-alone accounting package.\n\nFeatures \n\n* Double-entry bookkeeping\n* Scheduled Transactions\n* Mortgage and Loan Repayment Assistant\n* Small Business Accounting Features\n* OFX, QIF Import\n* HBCI Support\n* Transaction-Import Matching Support\n* SQL Support\n* Multi-Currency Transaction Handling\n* Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolios\n* Online Stock and Mutual Fund Quotes\n* Built-in and custom reports and charts\n* Budget\n* Bank and Credit Card reconciliation\n* Check printing\n\nSmall business accounting features \n\n*Invoicing and Credit Notes (Credit note functionality was added with version 2.6)\n*Accounts Receivable (A/R)\n*Accounts Payable (A/P) including bills due reminders\n*Employee expense voucher\n*Limited Payroll Management through use of A/Receivable and A/Payable accounts.\n*Depreciation\n*Mapping to income tax schedules and TXF export for import into tax prep software (US)\n*Setting up tax tables and applying sales tax on invoices\n\nTechnical design \n\nGnuCash is written primarily in C, with a small fraction in Scheme. One of the available features is pure fixed-point arithmetic to avoid rounding errors which would arise with floating-point arithmetic. This feature was introduced with version 1.6.\n\nThe Android App for GnuCash is written in Javahttp://www.codinguser.com/2012/07/coding-money-in-gnucash-for-android/ and does not share any code with the PC software.http://www.codinguser.com/2012/08/gnucash-for-android-now-with-apache-license-version-2-0/\n\nUsers \n\nUsers on the GnuCash mailing list have reported using it for United States 501(c)3 non-profit organizations successfully. However, the reports need to be exported and edited.\n\nSlaw, a Canadian legal webzine, offered this advice to lawyers just starting out in practice, especially those who are trying to pay off student loans, \"The GnuCash software...should present a great alternative for lawyers looking for a solid accounting system at low cost. Do not believe that open source software is somehow second-class.\"\n\nIn April 2011, the Minnesota State Bar Association  made their GnuCash trust accounting guide freely available in PDF format.\n\nDownload stats \n\nAs of June 2017, Sourceforge shows a count of over 5.9 million downloads of the stable releases starting from November 1999 Also, Sourceforge shows that current downloads are running at 13,775 per week. However, this doesn’t include other software download sites as well as Linux distributions that provide download from their own repositories.\n\nProject status \n\nOhloh did an analysis of the source code repository and compared the commit activity for the two years before March 2012 and concluded that the project has a mature, well established code base, with increasing year-over-year development activity and a large active development team.",
