It has more than 5,000 institutional clients.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald is one of 22 primary dealers that are authorized to trade US government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald's 1,600 employees work in more than 30 locations, including financial centers in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Together with its affiliates, Cantor Fitzgerald operates in more than 60 offices in 20 countries and has more than 8,500 employees.\n\nIn 2011, Cantor's affiliate, BGC Partners, expanded into commercial real estate services by its purchase of Newmark Knight Frank and the assets of Grubb & Ellis, to form Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.\n\nEarly history\n\nCantor Fitzgerald was formed in 1945 by Bernard Gerald Cantor and John Fitzgerald as an investment bank and brokerage business. It later became known for its computer-based bond brokerage, for the quality of its institutional distribution business model, and for being the market's premier dealer of government securities.\n\nIn 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began \"large block\" sales/trading of equities for institutional customers. It became the world's first electronic marketplace for US government securities in 1972 and in 1983, it was the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in US government securities.\n\nIn 1991, Howard Lutnick was named president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald; he became chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., in 1996.\n\n9/11 attacks\n\n \n\nCantor Fitzgerald's corporate headquarters and New York City office,\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20000304012316/http://www.cantor.com/locations.htm office locations].\" Cantor Fitzgerald.

At 8:46:46 a.m., six seconds after the tower was struck by the plane, a Goldman Sachs server issued an alert saying that its trading system had gone offline because it was unable to connect with the server.[http://911.wikileaks.org/files/messages_2001_09_11-08_45_2001_09_11-08_49.html#407 September 11, 2001 08:46:46 Arch [1612975] D ALPHA] Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 of its New York employees, 68% of its workforce, which was considerably more than any of the other World Trade Center tenants or the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, or the United States Department of Defense. Lutnick's brother was among those killed as the stairwells below them were destroyed or blocked by the plane crash. Lutnick vowed to keep the company alive, and the company was able to bring its trading markets back online within a week.\n\nOn September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25% of the firm's profits for the next five years, and it committed to paying for ten years of health care for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, eSpeed, and TradeSpark employees (profits that would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald partners).
