  "textBody" : "Abakan (; Khakas:  or ) is the capital city of the Republic of Khakassia, Russia, located in the central part of Minusinsk Depression, at the confluence of the Yenisei and Abakan Rivers. As of the 2010 Census, it had a population of 165,214—a slight increase over 165,197 recorded during the 2002 Census and a further increase from 154,092 recorded during the 1989 Census.\n\nHistory\n\nAbakansky ostrog (), also known as Abakansk (), was built at the mouth of the Abakan River in 1675. In the 1780s, the selo of Ust-Abakanskoye () was established in this area. It was granted town status and given its current name on April 30, 1931.Resolution of April 30, 1931\n\nChinese exiles\n\nIn 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and Askiz. When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in 1941–1945, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely Han Dynasty era (206 BCE–220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A. Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of Li Ling, a Chinese general who had been defeated by the Xiongnu in 99 BCE, and defected to them as a result. While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well. More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang (盧芳), a Han throne pretender from the Guangwu era.\n\nLithuanian exiles\n\nIn the late 18th and during the 19th century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against Russian rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of camps was established where prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After Stalin's death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in.\n\nAdministrative and municipal status\n\nAbakan is the capital of the republic.Law #20 Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the City of Abakan—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts As a municipal division, the City of Abakan is incorporated as Abakan Urban Okrug.Law #59\n\nEconomy\n\nThe city has a river port, industry enterprises, Katanov State University of Khakasia, and three theatres. Furthermore, it has a commercial center that produces footwear, foodstuffs, and metal products.\n\nTransportation\n\nAbakan (together with Tayshet) was a terminal of the major Abakan-Taishet Railway. Now it is an important railway junction.\n\nThe city is served by the Abakan International Airport.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe 100th Air Assault Brigade of the Russian Airborne Troops was based in the city until circa  1996.\n\nSites\n\nAbakan's sites of interest include Holy Transfiguration Cathedral, \"Good Angel of Peace\" sculpture, park of topiary art, and many others.\n\nSports\n\nBandy is the one of the most popular sports in the city. Sayany-Khakassia[http://xakac.info/files/news/43/11/news1425826770.jpeg Team picture of Sayany-Khakassia] was playing in the top-tier Super League in the 2012–13 season but was relegated for the 2013–14 season and has been playing in the Russian Bandy Supreme League ever since. Russian Government Cup was played here in 1988 and in 2012.\n\nClimate\n\nAbakan has a borderline humid continental (Köppen climate classification Dwb)/cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). Temperature differences between seasons are extreme, which is typical for Siberia. Precipitation is concentrated in the summer and is less common because of rain shadow from nearby mountains.",
