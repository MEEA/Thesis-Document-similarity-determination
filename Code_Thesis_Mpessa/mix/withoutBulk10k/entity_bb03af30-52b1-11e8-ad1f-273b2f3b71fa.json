  "textBody" : "An antipope () is a person who, in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected Pope, makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the Pope,\"One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt\" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28501/antipope Encyclopædia Britannica: Antipope]). the Bishop of Rome and leader of the Catholic Church. At times between the 3rd and mid-15th century, antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious cardinals and secular monarchs and kingdoms. Persons who claim to be pope, but have few followers, such as the modern sedevacantist antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.\n\nHistory\n\nHippolytus of Rome (d. 235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against Pope Callixtus I. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, Pope Pontian, and both he and Pontian are honoured as saints by the Roman Catholic Church with a shared feast day on 13 August. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, since no such claim by Hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him.\n\nEusebius quotesHistoria Ecclesiastica, V, 28 from an unnamed earlier writer the story of Natalius, a 3rd-century priest who accepted the bishopric of the Adoptionists, a heretical group in Rome. Natalius soon repented and tearfully begged Pope Zephyrinus to receive him into communion.Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature: Zephyrinus\n\nNovatian (d. 258), another third-century figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to Pope Cornelius, and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.\n\nThe period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the Holy Roman Emperors of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants (anti-kings) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.\n\nThe Western Schism — which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of Pope Urban VI was invalid, elected antipope Clement VII as a rival to the Roman Pope — led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes: the Avignon line (Clement VII took up residence in Avignon, France), and the Pisan line. The Pisan line, which began in 1409, was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected antipope Alexander V as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the Council of Constance deposed antipope John XXIII of the Pisan line. Pope Gregory XII of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed antipope Benedict XIII of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, Pope Martin V was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment and fed into the Protestant Reformation at the turn of the 16th century.\n\nList of historical antipopes \n\nThe following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the Annuario Pontificio, with the addition of the names of Natalius (in spite of doubts about his historicity) and Antipope Clement VIII (whose following was insignificant).[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm Michael Ott, \"Pope Martin V\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910)]\n \nAn asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. More commonly, the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers; for example, there was an Antipope John XXIII, but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called John XXIII. For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see Pope John (numbering).\n\nThe list of popes and antipopes in the Annuario Pontificio attaches the following note to the name of Pope Leo VIII (963–965):\n\nAt this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across elections in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of theology and canon law make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of Saint Peter. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 ), p. 12*\n\nThus, because of the obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, the Annuario Pontificio lists Sylvester III as a pope, without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy. The Catholic Encyclopedia places him in its List of Popes, but with the annotation: \"Considered by some to be an antipope\". Other sources classify him as an antipope.Charles William Previté-Orton The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History (Cambridge University Press 1952, republished 1975 ), vol. 1, p. 477[http://www.google.com/search?tbmbks&tbo\n1&q+Darras+%22title+of+sylvester+iii%22&btnG\n Joseph Épiphane Darras, A General History of the Catholic Church, vol. III, p. 58]\n\nThose with asterisks (*) were counted in subsequent Papal numbering.\n\nQuasi-cardinal-nephews \n\nMany antipopes created cardinals, known as quasi-cardinals, and a few created cardinal-nephews, known as quasi-cardinal-nephews.\n\nModern claimants to papacy \n\nIn modern times various people claim to be pope and, though they do not fit the technical definition of \"antipope\", are sometimes referred to as such. They are usually leaders of sedevacantist groups who view the See of Rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it. They are sometimes referred to as conclavists because of their claim, on the basis of an election by a \"conclave\" of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of David Bawden (\"Pope Michael I\"), to have rendered the See no longer vacant. A significant number of these have taken the name \"Peter II\", owing to its special significance. From the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church, they are schismatics, and as such are automatically excommunicated.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P52.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1364]\n\nCollinites \n\n* Michel Collin, self-proclaimed Pope Clement XV (1961–1974) in France, founder of the Apostles of Infinite Love) \n* Jean-Gaston Tremblay, Gregory XVII (1968–2011), in Canada\n\nPalmarian Catholic Church \n\n* Clemente Domínguez y Gómez (Pope Gregory XVII), mystically self-proclaimed (1978–2005) in Spain\n* Manuel Corral (Pope Peter II) (2005–11)\n* Ginés Jesús Hernández (Pope Gregory XVIII) (2011–2016)\n* Joseph Odermatt (Pope Peter III) (2016–present)\n\nThe Palmarian Catholic Church regards Pope Paul VI, whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the Holy See has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of El Palmar de Troya.\n\nOther examples \n\nThe following were elected by allegedly faithful Catholics, none of whom was a cardinal:\n* Popes of the \"Legio Maria\", based in western Kenya (not technically Conclavist):  Timothy Joseph Blasio Atila (1963–1998).

Alexander IX was chosen in his place.\n\nAntipope of Alexandria \n\nAs the Patriarch of Alexandria, Egypt, has historically also held the title of Pope, a person who, in opposition to someone who is generally accepted as a legitimate Pope of Alexandria, claims to hold that position may also be considered an Antipope. In 2006, the defrocked married Coptic lector Max Michel became an Antipope of Alexandria, calling himself Maximos I. His claim to the Alexandrine Papacy was dismissed by both the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III and Pope Theodore II of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Coptic Pope of Alexandria and the Greek Pope of Alexandria currently view one another, not as Antipopes, but rather as successors to differing lines of apostolic succession that formed as a result of christological disputes in the fifth century.\n\nAnother Coptic (Alexandrian) Antipope is known to have laid claim in the Fourth Century. His name was Gregory of Cappadocia.\n\nFiction \n\nAntipopes have appeared as fictional characters.
