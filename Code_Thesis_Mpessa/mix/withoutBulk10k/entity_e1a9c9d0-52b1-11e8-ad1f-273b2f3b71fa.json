  "textBody" : "In Judaism, \"chosenness\" is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a covenant with God. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of DeuteronomyClements, Ronald (1968). God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy. In series, Religious Book Club, 182. London: S.C.M. Press as the verb bahar (), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as \"holy people\".[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id9nN8AgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA9#vonepage&q&f\nfalse The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan] p. 9 Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations— Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission — to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.\n\nThis view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples — rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" (), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nethanel ibn Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966)  The Mishnah states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human, not Jewish, life, has done the same (save or kill) to an entire world. The Tosefta, an important supplement to the Mishnah(see Wikipedia \"Tosefta\"), also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nAccording to the Israel Democracy Institute, approximately two thirds of Israeli Jews believe that Jews are the \"chosen people\".[http://en.idi.org.il/media/2720081/Democracy%20Index%20English%202013.pdf 2013 Democracy Index], \"We asked: “To what extent do you believe that the Jews are the ‘chosen people’?” As shown in Figure 34, roughly two thirds of the Jewish respondents (64.3%) believe “very strongly” or “quite strongly” that the Jews are indeed the chosen people, while one third (32.7%) do not share this view.\"\n\nIn the Bible\n\nAccording to the Bible, Israel's character as the chosen people is unconditional as it says in , \n\"For you are a holy people to YHWH your God, and God has chosen you to be his treasured people from all the nations that are on the face of the earth.\"\n\nThe Torah also says, \n\"Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from all the peoples, for all the earth is mine\" ().\nGod promises that he will never exchange his people with any other:\n\"And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.\" [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchgenesis%2017:7&version\nNKJV (Genesis 17:7)].\n\nOther Torah verses about chosenness, \n*\"And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation\" ().\n*\"The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people; but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors.\" ().\n\nThe obligation imposed upon the Israelites was emphasized by the prophet Amos (): \n\"You only have I singled out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.\"\n\nRabbinic views\n\nSometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission — to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.  This view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples — rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God.\nBiblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" (), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nethanel ibn Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966)  The Mishnah states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human, not Jewish, life, has done the same (save or kill) to an entire world. The Tosefta, a collection of important post-Talmudic discourses, also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nThe idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Although collectively this choice was made freely, religious Jews believe that it created individual obligation for the descendants of the Israelites. Another opinion is that the choice was free in a limited context, thus: although the Jews chose to follow precepts ordained by God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the \"Jewish soul\" was already chosen.\n\nCrucial to the Jewish notion of chosenness is that it creates obligations exclusive to Jews, while non-Jews receive from God other covenants and other responsibilities. Generally, it does not entail exclusive rewards for Jews. Classical rabbinic literature in the Mishnah Avot 3:14 has this teaching:\n\nRabbi Akiva used to say, \"Beloved is man, for he was created in God's image; and the fact that God made it known that man was created in His image is indicative of an even greater love. As the verse states [], 'In the image of God, man was created.'\" The mishna goes on to say, \"Beloved are the people Israel, for they are called children of God; it is even a greater love that it was made known to them that they are called children of God, as it said, 'You are the children of the Lord, your God. Beloved are the people Israel, for a precious article [the Torah] was given to them ...\n\nMost Jewish texts do not state that \"God chose the Jews\" by itself. Rather, this is usually linked with a mission or purpose, such as proclaiming God's message among all the nations, even though Jews cannot become \"unchosen\" if they shirk their mission. This implies a special duty, which evolves from the belief that Jews have been pledged by the covenant which God concluded with the biblical patriarch Abraham, their ancestor, and again with the entire Jewish nation at Mount Sinai. In this view, Jews are charged with living a holy life as God's priest-people.\n\nIn the Jewish prayerbook (the Siddur), chosenness is referred to in a number of ways. The blessing for reading the Torah reads:\n\"Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us His Torah.\"\n\nIn the \"Kiddush\", a prayer of sanctification, in which the Sabbath is inaugurated over a cup of wine, the text reads: \n\"For you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations, and have given us the Sabbath as an inheritance in love and favour. Praised are you, Lord, who hallows the Sabbath.\"\n\nIn the \"Kiddush\" recited on festivals it says:\n\"Blessed are You ... who have chosen us from among all nations, raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments.\"\n\nThe Aleinu prayer refers to the concept of Jews as a chosen people:\n\nAn earlier form of this prayer, in use during the medieval era, contained an extra sentence:\nIt is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude, who worship mist and emptiness and pray to a god who cannot save.\n\nThis sentence in italics is an allusion to the Bible, Isaiah (): \n\"Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.\"\nIn the medieval era some within the Christian community came to believe that this line referred to Christians worshipping Jesus; they demanded that it be excised. Ismar Elbogen, a historian of the Jewish liturgy, held that the early form of the prayer pre-dated Christianity, and could not possibly have referred to it.\n\nFurther interpretations\n\nThe following section contains information from the Jewish Encyclopedia, originally published between 1901-1906, which is in the public domain.\n\nAccording to the Rabbis, \"Israel is of all nations the most willful or headstrong one, and the Torah was to give it the right scope and power of resistance, or else the world could not have withstood its fierceness.\"Beẓah, 25b\n\n\"The Lord offered the Law to all nations; but all refused to accept it except Israel.\"Mek. Yitro, Pes. R. K. 103b, 186a, 200a\n\nHow do we understand \"A Gentile who consecrates his life to the study and observance of the Law ranks as high as the high priest\", says R. Meïr, by deduction from Lev. xviii. 5; II Sam. vii. 19; Isa. xxvi. 2; Ps. xxxiii. 1, cxviii. 20, cxxv. 4, where all stress is laid not on Israel, but on man or the righteous one.Sifra, Aḥare Mot, 86b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" ii. 31\n\nMaimonides states: It is now abundantly clear that the pledges Hashem made to Avraham and his descendants would be fulfilled exclusively first in Yitzchak and then in Yaakov, Yitzchak son. This is confirmed by a passage that states, “He is ever mindful of His covenant . . . that He made with Avraham, swore to Yitzchak, and confirmed in a decree for Yaakov, for Yisrael, as an eternal covenant (Tehillim 105: 8,9).Avraham Yaakov Finkel. The essential Maimonides. Translations of the Rambam, Jason Aronson Inc, Northvale New Jersey London\n\nThe Gemara states this regarding a non-Jew who studies Torah [his 7 mitzvot] and regarding this, see Shita Mekubetzes, Bava Kama 38a who says that this is an exaggeration. In any case, this statement was not extolling the non-Jew. The Rishonim explain that it is extolling the Torah.\n\nTosfos explains that it uses the example of a kohen gadol (high priest), because this statement is based on the verse, \"y'kara hi mipnimim\" (it is more precious than pearls). This is explained elsewhere in the Gemara to mean that the Torah is more precious pnimim (translated here as \"inside\" instead of as \"pearls\"; thus that the Torah is introspectively absorbed into the person), which refers to lifnai v'lifnim (translated as \"the most inner of places\"), that is the Holy of Holies where the kahon gadol went.\n\nIn any case, in Midrash Rabba (Bamidbar 13:15) this statement is made with an important addition: a non-Jew who converts and studies Torah etc.\n\nThe Nation of Israel is likened to the olive. Just as this fruit yields its precious oil only after being much pressed and squeezed, so Israel's destiny is one of great oppression and hardship, in order that it may thereby give forth its illuminating wisdom.Ex. R. xxxvi:1. Poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people (Ḥag. 9b). Only on account of its good works is Israel among the nations \"as the lily among thorns\",Cant. R. ii. 2 or \"as wheat among the chaff.\"Midr. Teh. i. 4Weber's \"System der Altsynagogalen Theologie\", etc., pp. 59-69, is full of glaring errors and misstatements on the subject of Israel as the chosen people\n\nModern Orthodox views\n\nRabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain (Modern Orthodox Judaism), described chosenness in this way: \"Yes, I do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people—and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual—is \"chosen\" or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.\"qtd. in [https://books.google.com/books?idYr4_nhEmtcAC&pg\nPA21&lpgPA21&dq\n%22%22Yes,+I+do+believe+that+the+chosen+people+concept+as+affirmed+by+Judaism+in+its+holy+writ,+its+prayers,+and+its+millennial+tradition.%22&sourcebl&ots\nCgRAued75m&sigZ6jain4ueaEkX5Jh0cyDXJXbzhc&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwjm3JCnkKvZAhUkKsAKHSq7Dw0Q6AEIPTAE#vonepage&q\n%22%22Yes%2C%20I%20do%20believe%20that%20the%20chosen%20people%20concept%20as%20affirmed%20by%20Judaism%20in%20its%20holy%20writ%2C%20its%20prayers%2C%20and%20its%20millennial%20tradition.%22&f=false Mackenzie]\n\nRabbi Norman Lamm, a leader of Modern Orthodox Judaism wrote: \"The chosenness of Israel relates exclusively to its spiritual vocation embodied in the Torah; the doctrine, indeed, was announced at Sinai. Whenever it is mentioned in our liturgy—such as the blessing immediately preceding the Shema....it is always related to Torah or Mitzvot (commandments). This spiritual vocation consists of two complementary functions, described as \"Goy Kadosh\", that of a holy nation, and \"Mamlekhet Kohanim\", that of a kingdom of priests. The first term denotes the development of communal separateness or differences in order to achieve a collective self-transcendence [...] The second term implies the obligation of this brotherhood of the spiritual elite toward the rest of mankind; priesthood is defined by the prophets as fundamentally a teaching vocation.\"Lamm, Norman.

We are simply told that God commanded Abraham to leave his place of birth and go to a land that God would show him.  He is also promised that his descendants will become a numerous people.  But nowhere does the Bible tell us why Abraham rather than someone else was chosen.  The implication is that God chooses whom He wishes and that He owes no accounting to anyone for His choices.\"Wyschogrod, Michael.  The Body of Faith, Judaism as a Corporeal Election. \n 1984.  pp. 174-177.\n\nConservative views\n\nConservative Judaism, views the concept of chosenness in this way:\n\nRabbi Reuven Hammer comments on the excised sentence in the Aleinu prayer mentioned above:\n\nReform views\n\nReform Judaism views the concept of chosenness in this way:\n\nIn 1999 the Reform movement stated:\n\nAlternative views\n\nEquality of souls\n\nMany Kabbalistic sources, notably the Tanya, contain statements to the effect that the Jewish soul is qualitatively different from the non-Jewish soul. Some prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea; they believed in the essential equality of all human souls. Menahem Azariah da Fano, in his book Reincarnations of souls, provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated as Jews, and vice versa. Abraham Cohen de Herrera, another Kabbalist of the same school, quotes Greek, Christian and various Oriental mystics and philosophers without hesitation, and does not mention anything specific about the Jewish souls.\n\nA number of known Chabad rabbis offered alternative readings of the Tanya, did not take this teaching literally, and even managed to reconcile it with the leftist ideas of internationalism and class struggle. The original text of the Tanya refers to the \"idol worshippers\" and does not mention the \"nations of the world\" at all, although such interpretation was endorsed by Menachem Mendel Schneerson and is popular in contemporary Chabad circles. Hillel of Parich, an early Tanya commentator, wrote that the souls of righteous Gentiles are more similar to the Jewish souls, and are generally good and not egoistic. This teaching was accepted by Schneerson and is considered normative in Chabad.Lessons in Tanya, Vol. 1, Ch. 1\n\nDifferent in character but not value\n\nAccording to the author of the Tanya himself, a righteous non-Jew can achieve a high level of spiritually, similar to an angel, although his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one.סידור הרב, שער אכילת מצה Tzemach Tzedek, the third rebbe of Chabad, wrote that the Muslims are naturally good-hearted people. Rabbi Yosef Jacobson, a popular contemporary Chabad lecturer, teaches that in today's world most non-Jews belong to the category of righteous Gentiles, effectively rendering the Tanya's attitude anachronistic.\n\nDov Ber Pinson, a contemporary Chabad mystic, denies the idea that there is any essential difference between the Jews and non-Jews. According to his theory, every person has a lower animalistic and higher Godly soul. The Tanya does not talk about Jews and non-Jews as social groups, but describes the internal struggle between the materialistic \"Gentile\" and spiritual \"Jewish\" levels of consciousness within every human soul.Dov Ber Pinson, Reincarnation and Judaism\n\nAltruism\n\nAn anti-Zionist interpretation of Tanya was offered by Abraham Yehudah Khein, a prominent Ukrainian Chabad rabbi, who supported anarchist communism and considered Peter Kropotkin a great Tzaddik. Khein basically read the Tanya backwards; since the souls of idol worshipers are known to be evil, according to the Tanya, while the Jewish souls are known to be good, he concluded that truly altruistic people are really Jewish, in a spiritual sense, while Jewish nationalists and class oppressors are not. By this logic, he claimed that Vladimir Solovyov and Rabindranath Tagore probably have Jewish souls, while Leon Trotsky and other totalitarians do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to apes, are merely \"Jewish by birth certificate\".ר' אברהם חן, במלכות היהדות (Rabbi Abraham Chen, \"In the Kingdom of Judaism\")\n\nRighteous non-Jews\n\nNachman of Breslov also believed that Jewishness is a level of consciousness, and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the Book of Malachi, one can find \"potential Jews\" among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of \"holy faith\", which \"activated\" the Jewishness in their soul. These people would otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so. Instead, they recognize the Divine unity within their pagan religions.Likutei Moharan, Part 2 ,5\n\nIsaac Arama, an influential philosopher and mystic of the 15th century, believed that righteous non-Jews are spiritually identical to the righteous Jews.Isaac Arama, Akedat Yitzchak, Ch. 60 Rabbi Menachem Meiri, a famous Catalan Talmudic commentator and Maimonidian philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, to be part of a greater \"spiritual Israel\". He explicitly included Christian and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who had no sense of morality. The only exceptions are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.\n\nMeiri applied his idea of \"spiritual Israel\" to the Talmudic statements about unique qualities of the Jewish people. For example, he believed that the famous saying that Israel is above astrological predestination (Ein Mazal le-Israel) also applied to the followers of other ethical faiths. He also considered countries, inhabited by decent moral non-Jews, such as Languedoc, as a spiritual part of the Holy Land.Gregg Stern. Philosophy and Rabbinic Culture: Jewish Interpretation and Controversy in Medieval Languedoc. Routledge Jewish Studies Series\n\nSpinoza\n\nOne Jewish critic of chosenness was the philosopher Baruch Spinoza. In the third chapter of his Theologico-Political Treatise, Spinoza mounts an argument against a naive interpretation of God's choice of the Jews. Bringing evidence from the Bible itself, he argues that God's choice of Israel was not unique (he had chosen other nations before choosing the Hebrew nation) and that the choice of the Jews is neither inclusive (it does not include all of the Jews, but only the 'pious' ones) nor exclusive (it also includes 'true gentile prophets'). Finally, he argues that God's choice is not unconditional. Recalling the numerous times God threatened the complete destruction of the Hebrew nation, he asserts that this choice is neither absolute, nor eternal, nor necessary. Moreover, in aphorism 12 he writes, \"Thus the Jews today have absolutely nothing that they can attribute to themselves but not to other peoples....\"\n\nReconstructionist criticism \n\nReconstructionist Judaism rejects the concept of chosenness. Its founder, Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, said that the idea that God chose the Jewish people leads to racist beliefs among Jews, and thus must be excised from Jewish theology. This rejection of chosenness is made explicit in the movement's siddurim (prayer books).\n\nFor example, the original blessing recited before reading from the Torah contains the phrase, \"asher bahar banu mikol ha’amim\"—\"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, who has chosen us from among all peoples by giving us the Torah.\"  The Reconstructionist version is rewritten as \"asher kervanu la’avodato\", \"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, who has drawn us to your service by giving us the Torah.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Reconstructionist movement issued its Platform on Reconstructionism. It states that the idea of chosenness is \"morally untenable\", because anyone who has such beliefs \"implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others.\"Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, newsletter, September 1986, pages D, E.\n\nNot all Reconstructionists accept this view. The newest siddur of the movement, Kol Haneshamah, includes the traditional blessings as an option, and some modern Reconstructionist writers have opined that the traditional formulation is not racist, and should be embraced.e.g. Mitchell Max, The Chosen People: Reclaiming Our Sacred Myth\n\nAn original prayer book, by Reconstructionist feminist poet Marcia Falk, The Book of Blessings, has been widely accepted by both Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Falk rejects all concepts relating to hierarchy or distinction; she sees any distinction as leading to the acceptance of other kinds of distinctions, thus leading to prejudice. She writes that as a politically liberal feminist, she must reject distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, Jews and non-Jews, and to some extent even distinctions between the Sabbath and the other six days of the week. She thus rejects idea of chosenness as unethical. She also rejects Jewish theology in general, and instead holds to a form of religious humanism. Falk writes:\n\nReconstructionist author Judith Plaskow also criticises the idea of chosenness, for many of the same reasons as Falk. A politically liberal lesbian, Plaskow rejects most distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, and Jews and non-Jews. In contrast to Falk, Plaskow does not reject all concepts of difference as inherently leading to unethical beliefs, and holds to a more classical form of Jewish theism than Falk.\n\nA number of responses to these views have been made by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain Haredi communities, such as Chabad). A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms of Judaism in all denominations of Judaism, which do not have a problem with the concepts of chosenness.\n\nViews from other religions\n\nIslam\n\nThe children of Israel enjoy a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran:\nO children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).http://www.askmusa.org/site/c.ehLKKZPJLuF/b.3125653/k.7027/The_Jews_and_the_Quran.htm\n\nHowever, Muslim scholars point out that this status did not confer upon Israelites any racial superiority, and was only valid so long as the Israelites maintain their covenant with God,M. Abdulsalam. \"[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/310/ Is the Quran Anti-Semitic?: The Semites, a Chosen People].\"\nIndeed God had taken the covenant from the Children of Israel, and We appointed twelve leaders among them. And God said: \"I am with you if you establish the prayer and offer the Zakat (compulsory charity) and believe in My Messengers; honor and assist them, and lend to God a good loan. Verily, I will remit your sins and admit you to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise). But if any of you after this, disbelieve, he has indeed gone astray from the Straight Path.\" (Quran 5:12)\n\nChristianity\n\nSome Christians believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (),Liberation and reconciliation: a Black theology p.  24 but because of Jewish Rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status ().The Collegeville Bible Commentary: Based on the New American Bible, Robert J. Karris, Liturgical Press, 1992, p. 1042 This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.\n\nAugustine criticized Jewish chosenness as \"carnal.\" He reasoned that Israel was chosen \"according to the flesh.\"Augustine.  Adversius Judaios.\n\nInfluence on relations with other religions \n\nAvi Beker, an Israeli scholar and former Secretary General of the World Jewish Congress, regarded the idea of the chosen people as Judaism's defining concept and \"the central unspoken psychological, historical, and theological problem at the heart of Jewish-Gentile relations.\" In his book The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, Beker expresses the view that the concept of chosenness is the driving force behind Jewish-Gentile relations, explaining both the admiration and, more pointedly, the envy and hatred the world has felt for the Jews in religious and also secular terms. Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam has neither reversed nor reformed its theology concerning the succession of both the Jews and the Christians. According to Beker, this presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Macmilan, 2008, Preface\n\nEthnocentrism \n\nIsraeli philosopher Ze’ev Levy writes that chosenness can be \"(partially) justified only from the historical angle\" with respect to its spiritual and moral contribution to Jewish life through the centuries, \"a powerful agent of consolation and hope\". He points out however that modern anthropological theories \"do not merely proclaim the inherent universal equality of all people [as] human beings; they also stress the equivalence of all human cultures.\" (emphasis in original) He continues that \"there are no inferior and superior people or cultures but only different, other, ones.\" He concludes that the concept of chosenness entails ethnocentrism, \"which does not go hand in hand with otherness, that is, with unconditional respect of otherness\".Ze’ev Levy, Judaism and Chosenness: On Some Controversial Aspects from Spinoza to Contemporary Jewish Thought, in , p. 104\n\nSome people\n*Dinstien, Yoram (Ed.), Israel Yearbook on Human Rights 1987, Volume 17; Volume 1987, p 29\n*Sharoni, Simona, \"Feminist Reflections on the Interplay between Racism and Sexism in Israel\", in Challenging racism and sexism: alternatives to genetic explanations,\tEthel Tobach, Betty Rosoff (Eds), Feminist Press, 1994, p 319\n*Beker, Avi, Chosen: the history of an idea, the anatomy of an obsession, Macmillan, 2008, p 131, 139, 151\n*Brown, Wesley, Christian Perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, p 66\n*Jacob, Jonathan, Israel: a divided Promised Land, p 69\n have claimed that Judaism's chosen people concept is racist because it implies that Jews are superior to non-Jews. The Anti-Defamation League asserts that the concept of a chosen people within Judaism has nothing to do with racial superiority.[http://www.adl.org/presrele/asus_12/the_talmud.pdf The Talmud in Anti-Semitic Polemics] , Anti-Defamation League (February 2003)",

Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission — to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.\n\nThis view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples — rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" (), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nethanel ibn Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966)  The Mishnah states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human, not Jewish, life, has done the same (save or kill) to an entire world. The Tosefta, an important supplement to the Mishnah(see Wikipedia \"Tosefta\"), also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nAccording to the Israel Democracy Institute, approximately two thirds of Israeli Jews believe that Jews are the \"chosen people\".[http://en.idi.org.il/media/2720081/Democracy%20Index%20English%202013.pdf 2013 Democracy Index], \"We asked: “To what extent do you believe that the Jews are the ‘chosen people’?” As shown in Figure 34, roughly two thirds of the Jewish respondents (64.3%) believe “very strongly” or “quite strongly” that the Jews are indeed the chosen people, while one third (32.7%) do not share this view.\"\n\nIn the Bible\n\nAccording to the Bible, Israel's character as the chosen people is unconditional as it says in , \n\"For you are a holy people to YHWH your God, and God has chosen you to be his treasured people from all the nations that are on the face of the earth.\"\n\nThe Torah also says, \n\"Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from all the peoples, for all the earth is mine\" ().\nGod promises that he will never exchange his people with any other:\n\"And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.\" [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchgenesis%2017:7&version\nNKJV (Genesis 17:7)].\n\nOther Torah verses about chosenness, \n*\"And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation\" ().\n*\"The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people; but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors.\" ().\n\nThe obligation imposed upon the Israelites was emphasized by the prophet Amos (): \n\"You only have I singled out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.\"\n\nRabbinic views\n\nSometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission — to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.  This view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples — rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God.\nBiblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" (), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nethanel ibn Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966)  The Mishnah states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human, not Jewish, life, has done the same (save or kill) to an entire world. The Tosefta, a collection of important post-Talmudic discourses, also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nThe idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Although collectively this choice was made freely, religious Jews believe that it created individual obligation for the descendants of the Israelites. Another opinion is that the choice was free in a limited context, thus: although the Jews chose to follow precepts ordained by God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the \"Jewish soul\" was already chosen.\n\nCrucial to the Jewish notion of chosenness is that it creates obligations exclusive to Jews, while non-Jews receive from God other covenants and other responsibilities. Generally, it does not entail exclusive rewards for Jews. Classical rabbinic literature in the Mishnah Avot 3:14 has this teaching:\n\nRabbi Akiva used to say, \"Beloved is man, for he was created in God's image; and the fact that God made it known that man was created in His image is indicative of an even greater love. As the verse states [], 'In the image of God, man was created.'\" The mishna goes on to say, \"Beloved are the people Israel, for they are called children of God; it is even a greater love that it was made known to them that they are called children of God, as it said, 'You are the children of the Lord, your God. Beloved are the people Israel, for a precious article [the Torah] was given to them ...\n\nMost Jewish texts do not state that \"God chose the Jews\" by itself. Rather, this is usually linked with a mission or purpose, such as proclaiming God's message among all the nations, even though Jews cannot become \"unchosen\" if they shirk their mission. This implies a special duty, which evolves from the belief that Jews have been pledged by the covenant which God concluded with the biblical patriarch Abraham, their ancestor, and again with the entire Jewish nation at Mount Sinai. In this view, Jews are charged with living a holy life as God's priest-people.\n\nIn the Jewish prayerbook (the Siddur), chosenness is referred to in a number of ways. The blessing for reading the Torah reads:\n\"Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us His Torah.\"\n\nIn the \"Kiddush\", a prayer of sanctification, in which the Sabbath is inaugurated over a cup of wine, the text reads: \n\"For you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations, and have given us the Sabbath as an inheritance in love and favour. Praised are you, Lord, who hallows the Sabbath.\"\n\nIn the \"Kiddush\" recited on festivals it says:\n\"Blessed are You ... who have chosen us from among all nations, raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments.\"\n\nThe Aleinu prayer refers to the concept of Jews as a chosen people:\n\nAn earlier form of this prayer, in use during the medieval era, contained an extra sentence:\nIt is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude, who worship mist and emptiness and pray to a god who cannot save.\n\nThis sentence in italics is an allusion to the Bible, Isaiah (): \n\"Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.\"\nIn the medieval era some within the Christian community came to believe that this line referred to Christians worshipping Jesus; they demanded that it be excised. Ismar Elbogen, a historian of the Jewish liturgy, held that the early form of the prayer pre-dated Christianity, and could not possibly have referred to it.\n\nFurther interpretations\n\nThe following section contains information from the Jewish Encyclopedia, originally published between 1901-1906, which is in the public domain.\n\nAccording to the Rabbis, \"Israel is of all nations the most willful or headstrong one, and the Torah was to give it the right scope and power of resistance, or else the world could not have withstood its fierceness.\"Beẓah, 25b\n\n\"The Lord offered the Law to all nations; but all refused to accept it except Israel.\"Mek. Yitro, Pes. R. K. 103b, 186a, 200a\n\nHow do we understand \"A Gentile who consecrates his life to the study and observance of the Law ranks as high as the high priest\", says R. Meïr, by deduction from Lev. xviii. 5; II Sam. vii. 19; Isa. xxvi. 2; Ps. xxxiii. 1, cxviii. 20, cxxv. 4, where all stress is laid not on Israel, but on man or the righteous one.Sifra, Aḥare Mot, 86b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" ii. 31\n\nMaimonides states: It is now abundantly clear that the pledges Hashem made to Avraham and his descendants would be fulfilled exclusively first in Yitzchak and then in Yaakov, Yitzchak son. This is confirmed by a passage that states, “He is ever mindful of His covenant . . . that He made with Avraham, swore to Yitzchak, and confirmed in a decree for Yaakov, for Yisrael, as an eternal covenant (Tehillim 105: 8,9).Avraham Yaakov Finkel. The essential Maimonides. Translations of the Rambam, Jason Aronson Inc, Northvale New Jersey London\n\nThe Gemara states this regarding a non-Jew who studies Torah [his 7 mitzvot] and regarding this, see Shita Mekubetzes, Bava Kama 38a who says that this is an exaggeration. In any case, this statement was not extolling the non-Jew. The Rishonim explain that it is extolling the Torah.\n\nTosfos explains that it uses the example of a kohen gadol (high priest), because this statement is based on the verse, \"y'kara hi mipnimim\" (it is more precious than pearls). This is explained elsewhere in the Gemara to mean that the Torah is more precious pnimim (translated here as \"inside\" instead of as \"pearls\"; thus that the Torah is introspectively absorbed into the person), which refers to lifnai v'lifnim (translated as \"the most inner of places\"), that is the Holy of Holies where the kahon gadol went.\n\nIn any case, in Midrash Rabba (Bamidbar 13:15) this statement is made with an important addition: a non-Jew who converts and studies Torah etc.\n\nThe Nation of Israel is likened to the olive. Just as this fruit yields its precious oil only after being much pressed and squeezed, so Israel's destiny is one of great oppression and hardship, in order that it may thereby give forth its illuminating wisdom.Ex. R. xxxvi:1. Poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people (Ḥag. 9b). Only on account of its good works is Israel among the nations \"as the lily among thorns\",Cant. R. ii. 2 or \"as wheat among the chaff.\"Midr. Teh. i. 4Weber's \"System der Altsynagogalen Theologie\", etc., pp. 59-69, is full of glaring errors and misstatements on the subject of Israel as the chosen people\n\nModern Orthodox views\n\nRabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain (Modern Orthodox Judaism), described chosenness in this way: \"Yes, I do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people—and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual—is \"chosen\" or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.\"qtd. in [https://books.google.com/books?idYr4_nhEmtcAC&pg\nPA21&lpgPA21&dq\n%22%22Yes,+I+do+believe+that+the+chosen+people+concept+as+affirmed+by+Judaism+in+its+holy+writ,+its+prayers,+and+its+millennial+tradition.%22&sourcebl&ots\nCgRAued75m&sigZ6jain4ueaEkX5Jh0cyDXJXbzhc&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwjm3JCnkKvZAhUkKsAKHSq7Dw0Q6AEIPTAE#vonepage&q\n%22%22Yes%2C%20I%20do%20believe%20that%20the%20chosen%20people%20concept%20as%20affirmed%20by%20Judaism%20in%20its%20holy%20writ%2C%20its%20prayers%2C%20and%20its%20millennial%20tradition.%22&f=false Mackenzie]\n\nRabbi Norman Lamm, a leader of Modern Orthodox Judaism wrote: \"The chosenness of Israel relates exclusively to its spiritual vocation embodied in the Torah; the doctrine, indeed, was announced at Sinai. Whenever it is mentioned in our liturgy—such as the blessing immediately preceding the Shema....it is always related to Torah or Mitzvot (commandments). This spiritual vocation consists of two complementary functions, described as \"Goy Kadosh\", that of a holy nation, and \"Mamlekhet Kohanim\", that of a kingdom of priests. The first term denotes the development of communal separateness or differences in order to achieve a collective self-transcendence [...] The second term implies the obligation of this brotherhood of the spiritual elite toward the rest of mankind; priesthood is defined by the prophets as fundamentally a teaching vocation.\"Lamm, Norman.

We are simply told that God commanded Abraham to leave his place of birth and go to a land that God would show him.  He is also promised that his descendants will become a numerous people.  But nowhere does the Bible tell us why Abraham rather than someone else was chosen.  The implication is that God chooses whom He wishes and that He owes no accounting to anyone for His choices.\"Wyschogrod, Michael.  The Body of Faith, Judaism as a Corporeal Election. \n 1984.  pp. 174-177.\n\nConservative views\n\nConservative Judaism, views the concept of chosenness in this way:\n\nRabbi Reuven Hammer comments on the excised sentence in the Aleinu prayer mentioned above:\n\nReform views\n\nReform Judaism views the concept of chosenness in this way:\n\nIn 1999 the Reform movement stated:\n\nAlternative views\n\nEquality of souls\n\nMany Kabbalistic sources, notably the Tanya, contain statements to the effect that the Jewish soul is qualitatively different from the non-Jewish soul. Some prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea; they believed in the essential equality of all human souls. Menahem Azariah da Fano, in his book Reincarnations of souls, provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated as Jews, and vice versa. Abraham Cohen de Herrera, another Kabbalist of the same school, quotes Greek, Christian and various Oriental mystics and philosophers without hesitation, and does not mention anything specific about the Jewish souls.\n\nA number of known Chabad rabbis offered alternative readings of the Tanya, did not take this teaching literally, and even managed to reconcile it with the leftist ideas of internationalism and class struggle. The original text of the Tanya refers to the \"idol worshippers\" and does not mention the \"nations of the world\" at all, although such interpretation was endorsed by Menachem Mendel Schneerson and is popular in contemporary Chabad circles. Hillel of Parich, an early Tanya commentator, wrote that the souls of righteous Gentiles are more similar to the Jewish souls, and are generally good and not egoistic. This teaching was accepted by Schneerson and is considered normative in Chabad.Lessons in Tanya, Vol. 1, Ch. 1\n\nDifferent in character but not value\n\nAccording to the author of the Tanya himself, a righteous non-Jew can achieve a high level of spiritually, similar to an angel, although his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one.סידור הרב, שער אכילת מצה Tzemach Tzedek, the third rebbe of Chabad, wrote that the Muslims are naturally good-hearted people. Rabbi Yosef Jacobson, a popular contemporary Chabad lecturer, teaches that in today's world most non-Jews belong to the category of righteous Gentiles, effectively rendering the Tanya's attitude anachronistic.\n\nDov Ber Pinson, a contemporary Chabad mystic, denies the idea that there is any essential difference between the Jews and non-Jews. According to his theory, every person has a lower animalistic and higher Godly soul. The Tanya does not talk about Jews and non-Jews as social groups, but describes the internal struggle between the materialistic \"Gentile\" and spiritual \"Jewish\" levels of consciousness within every human soul.Dov Ber Pinson, Reincarnation and Judaism\n\nAltruism\n\nAn anti-Zionist interpretation of Tanya was offered by Abraham Yehudah Khein, a prominent Ukrainian Chabad rabbi, who supported anarchist communism and considered Peter Kropotkin a great Tzaddik. Khein basically read the Tanya backwards; since the souls of idol worshipers are known to be evil, according to the Tanya, while the Jewish souls are known to be good, he concluded that truly altruistic people are really Jewish, in a spiritual sense, while Jewish nationalists and class oppressors are not. By this logic, he claimed that Vladimir Solovyov and Rabindranath Tagore probably have Jewish souls, while Leon Trotsky and other totalitarians do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to apes, are merely \"Jewish by birth certificate\".ר' אברהם חן, במלכות היהדות (Rabbi Abraham Chen, \"In the Kingdom of Judaism\")\n\nRighteous non-Jews\n\nNachman of Breslov also believed that Jewishness is a level of consciousness, and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the Book of Malachi, one can find \"potential Jews\" among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of \"holy faith\", which \"activated\" the Jewishness in their soul. These people would otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so. Instead, they recognize the Divine unity within their pagan religions.Likutei Moharan, Part 2 ,5\n\nIsaac Arama, an influential philosopher and mystic of the 15th century, believed that righteous non-Jews are spiritually identical to the righteous Jews.Isaac Arama, Akedat Yitzchak, Ch. 60 Rabbi Menachem Meiri, a famous Catalan Talmudic commentator and Maimonidian philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, to be part of a greater \"spiritual Israel\". He explicitly included Christian and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who had no sense of morality. The only exceptions are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.\n\nMeiri applied his idea of \"spiritual Israel\" to the Talmudic statements about unique qualities of the Jewish people. For example, he believed that the famous saying that Israel is above astrological predestination (Ein Mazal le-Israel) also applied to the followers of other ethical faiths. He also considered countries, inhabited by decent moral non-Jews, such as Languedoc, as a spiritual part of the Holy Land.Gregg Stern. Philosophy and Rabbinic Culture: Jewish Interpretation and Controversy in Medieval Languedoc. Routledge Jewish Studies Series\n\nSpinoza\n\nOne Jewish critic of chosenness was the philosopher Baruch Spinoza. In the third chapter of his Theologico-Political Treatise, Spinoza mounts an argument against a naive interpretation of God's choice of the Jews. Bringing evidence from the Bible itself, he argues that God's choice of Israel was not unique (he had chosen other nations before choosing the Hebrew nation) and that the choice of the Jews is neither inclusive (it does not include all of the Jews, but only the 'pious' ones) nor exclusive (it also includes 'true gentile prophets'). Finally, he argues that God's choice is not unconditional. Recalling the numerous times God threatened the complete destruction of the Hebrew nation, he asserts that this choice is neither absolute, nor eternal, nor necessary. Moreover, in aphorism 12 he writes, \"Thus the Jews today have absolutely nothing that they can attribute to themselves but not to other peoples....\"\n\nReconstructionist criticism \n\nReconstructionist Judaism rejects the concept of chosenness. Its founder, Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, said that the idea that God chose the Jewish people leads to racist beliefs among Jews, and thus must be excised from Jewish theology. This rejection of chosenness is made explicit in the movement's siddurim (prayer books).\n\nFor example, the original blessing recited before reading from the Torah contains the phrase, \"asher bahar banu mikol ha’amim\"—\"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, who has chosen us from among all peoples by giving us the Torah.\"  The Reconstructionist version is rewritten as \"asher kervanu la’avodato\", \"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, who has drawn us to your service by giving us the Torah.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Reconstructionist movement issued its Platform on Reconstructionism. It states that the idea of chosenness is \"morally untenable\", because anyone who has such beliefs \"implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others.\"Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, newsletter, September 1986, pages D, E.\n\nNot all Reconstructionists accept this view. The newest siddur of the movement, Kol Haneshamah, includes the traditional blessings as an option, and some modern Reconstructionist writers have opined that the traditional formulation is not racist, and should be embraced.e.g. Mitchell Max, The Chosen People: Reclaiming Our Sacred Myth\n\nAn original prayer book, by Reconstructionist feminist poet Marcia Falk, The Book of Blessings, has been widely accepted by both Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Falk rejects all concepts relating to hierarchy or distinction; she sees any distinction as leading to the acceptance of other kinds of distinctions, thus leading to prejudice. She writes that as a politically liberal feminist, she must reject distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, Jews and non-Jews, and to some extent even distinctions between the Sabbath and the other six days of the week. She thus rejects idea of chosenness as unethical. She also rejects Jewish theology in general, and instead holds to a form of religious humanism. Falk writes:\n\nReconstructionist author Judith Plaskow also criticises the idea of chosenness, for many of the same reasons as Falk. A politically liberal lesbian, Plaskow rejects most distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, and Jews and non-Jews. In contrast to Falk, Plaskow does not reject all concepts of difference as inherently leading to unethical beliefs, and holds to a more classical form of Jewish theism than Falk.\n\nA number of responses to these views have been made by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain Haredi communities, such as Chabad). A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms of Judaism in all denominations of Judaism, which do not have a problem with the concepts of chosenness.\n\nViews from other religions\n\nIslam\n\nThe children of Israel enjoy a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran:\nO children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).http://www.askmusa.org/site/c.ehLKKZPJLuF/b.3125653/k.7027/The_Jews_and_the_Quran.htm\n\nHowever, Muslim scholars point out that this status did not confer upon Israelites any racial superiority, and was only valid so long as the Israelites maintain their covenant with God,M. Abdulsalam. \"[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/310/ Is the Quran Anti-Semitic?: The Semites, a Chosen People].\"\nIndeed God had taken the covenant from the Children of Israel, and We appointed twelve leaders among them. And God said: \"I am with you if you establish the prayer and offer the Zakat (compulsory charity) and believe in My Messengers; honor and assist them, and lend to God a good loan. Verily, I will remit your sins and admit you to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise). But if any of you after this, disbelieve, he has indeed gone astray from the Straight Path.\" (Quran 5:12)\n\nChristianity\n\nSome Christians believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (),Liberation and reconciliation: a Black theology p.  24 but because of Jewish Rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status ().The Collegeville Bible Commentary: Based on the New American Bible, Robert J. Karris, Liturgical Press, 1992, p. 1042 This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.\n\nAugustine criticized Jewish chosenness as \"carnal.\" He reasoned that Israel was chosen \"according to the flesh.\"Augustine.  Adversius Judaios.\n\nInfluence on relations with other religions \n\nAvi Beker, an Israeli scholar and former Secretary General of the World Jewish Congress, regarded the idea of the chosen people as Judaism's defining concept and \"the central unspoken psychological, historical, and theological problem at the heart of Jewish-Gentile relations.\" In his book The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, Beker expresses the view that the concept of chosenness is the driving force behind Jewish-Gentile relations, explaining both the admiration and, more pointedly, the envy and hatred the world has felt for the Jews in religious and also secular terms. Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam has neither reversed nor reformed its theology concerning the succession of both the Jews and the Christians. According to Beker, this presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Macmilan, 2008, Preface\n\nEthnocentrism \n\nIsraeli philosopher Ze’ev Levy writes that chosenness can be \"(partially) justified only from the historical angle\" with respect to its spiritual and moral contribution to Jewish life through the centuries, \"a powerful agent of consolation and hope\". He points out however that modern anthropological theories \"do not merely proclaim the inherent universal equality of all people [as] human beings; they also stress the equivalence of all human cultures.\" (emphasis in original) He continues that \"there are no inferior and superior people or cultures but only different, other, ones.\" He concludes that the concept of chosenness entails ethnocentrism, \"which does not go hand in hand with otherness, that is, with unconditional respect of otherness\".Ze’ev Levy, Judaism and Chosenness: On Some Controversial Aspects from Spinoza to Contemporary Jewish Thought, in , p. 104\n\nSome people\n*Dinstien, Yoram (Ed.), Israel Yearbook on Human Rights 1987, Volume 17; Volume 1987, p 29\n*Sharoni, Simona, \"Feminist Reflections on the Interplay between Racism and Sexism in Israel\", in Challenging racism and sexism: alternatives to genetic explanations,\tEthel Tobach, Betty Rosoff (Eds), Feminist Press, 1994, p 319\n*Beker, Avi, Chosen: the history of an idea, the anatomy of an obsession, Macmillan, 2008, p 131, 139, 151\n*Brown, Wesley, Christian Perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, p 66\n*Jacob, Jonathan, Israel: a divided Promised Land, p 69\n have claimed that Judaism's chosen people concept is racist because it implies that Jews are superior to non-Jews. The Anti-Defamation League asserts that the concept of a chosen people within Judaism has nothing to do with racial superiority.[http://www.adl.org/presrele/asus_12/the_talmud.pdf The Talmud in Anti-Semitic Polemics] , Anti-Defamation League (February 2003).
