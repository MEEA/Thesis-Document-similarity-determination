  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation, just as division is the inverse of multiplication. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In the most simple case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g., since , the \"logarithm to base \" of  is .  More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers  and  where  is not equal to . The logarithm of  to base , denoted  (or  when no confusion is possible), is the unique real number  such that . For example, , as .\n\nThe logarithm to base  (that is ) is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering. The natural logarithm has the number  () as its base;  its use is widespread in mathematics and physics, because of its simpler derivative. The binary logarithm uses base  (that is ) and is commonly used in computer science.\n\nLogarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations. They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily, using slide rules and logarithm tables. Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition because of the fact—important in its own right—that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:\n \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,\nprovided that ,  and  are all positive and .\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from Leonhard Euler, who connected them to the exponential function in the 18th century.\n\nLogarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel (dB) is a unit used to express log-ratios, mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which sound pressure is a common example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They help describing frequency ratios of musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers or approximating factorials, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses exponentiation, the complex logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers. The discrete logarithm is another variant; it has uses in public-key cryptography.\n\nMotivation and definition\n\nThe idea of logarithms is to reverse the operation of exponentiation, that is, raising a number to a power. For example, the third power (or cube) of 2 is 8, because 8 is the product of three factors of 2:\n\n2^3 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \n 8\n\nIt follows that the logarithm of 8 with respect to base 2 is 3, so .\n\nExponentiation\n\nThe third power of some number  is the product of three factors equal to . More generally, raising  to the  power, where  is a natural number, is done by multiplying  factors equal to . The  power of  is written , so that\n\nb^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}\n\nExponentiation may be extended to , where  is a positive number and the exponent  is any real number. For example,  is the reciprocal of , that is, .

For any integer x, the quantity of prime numbers less than or equal to x is denoted prime-counting function|. The prime number theorem asserts that  is approximately given by\n\\frac{x}{\\ln(x)},\nin the sense that the ratio of  and that fraction approaches 1 when x tends to infinity., theorem 4.1 As a consequence, the probability that a randomly chosen number between 1 and x is prime is inversely proportional to the number of decimal digits of x. A far better estimate of  is given by the\noffset logarithmic integral function , defined by\n \\mathrm{Li}(x) = \\int_2^x \\frac1{\\ln(t)} \\,dt.  \nThe Riemann hypothesis, one of the oldest open mathematical conjectures, can be stated in terms of comparing  and . The Erdős–Kac theorem describing the number of distinct prime factors also involves the natural logarithm.\n\nThe logarithm of n factorial, , is given by\n \\ln (n!) = \\ln (1) + \\ln (2) + \\cdots + \\ln (n). \\,\nThis can be used to obtain Stirling's formula, an approximation of  for large n., chapter 4\n\nGeneralizations\n\nComplex logarithm\n\nThe complex numbers a solving the equation\n\ne^a=z.\\,\n\nare called complex logarithms. Here, z is a complex number. A complex number is commonly represented as , where x and y are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. Such a number can be visualized by a point in the complex plane, as shown at the right. The polar form encodes a non-zero complex number z by its absolute value, that is, the distance r to the origin, and an angle between the x axis and the line passing through the origin and z. This angle is called the argument of z. The absolute value r of z is\n\nr=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}. \\,\n\nThe argument is not uniquely specified by z: both  and ' =  + 2 are arguments of z because adding  radians or 360 degrees to φ corresponds to \"winding\" around the origin counter-clock-wise by a turn. The resulting complex number is again z, as illustrated at the right. However, exactly one argument  satisfies  and . It is called the principal argument, denoted , with a capital A., Definition 1.6.3 (An alternative normalization is ., section 5.9)\n\nUsing trigonometric functions sine and cosine, or the complex exponential, respectively, r and φ are such that the following identities hold:, section 1.2\n\n\\begin{array}{lll}z& = & r \\left (\\cos \\varphi + i \\sin \\varphi\\right) \\\\\n& = & r e^{i \\varphi}.\n\\end{array} \\,\n\nThis implies that the  power of e equals z, where\n\na = \\ln (r) + i ( \\varphi + 2 n \\pi ), \\,\n\nφ is the principal argument Arg(z) and n is an arbitrary integer. Any such a is called a complex logarithm of z. There are infinitely many of them, in contrast to the uniquely defined real logarithm. If , a is called the principal value of the logarithm, denoted . The principal argument of any positive real number x is 0; hence  is a real number and equals the real (natural) logarithm. However, the above formulas for logarithms of products and powers do not generalize to the principal value of the complex logarithm., theorem 6.1.\n\nThe illustration at the right depicts . The discontinuity, that is, the jump in the hue at the negative part of the x- or real axis, is caused by the jump of the principal argument there. This locus is called a branch cut. This behavior can only be circumvented by dropping the range restriction on φ. Then the argument of z and, consequently, its logarithm become multi-valued functions.\n\nInverses of other exponential functions\n\nExponentiation occurs in many areas of mathematics and its inverse function is often referred to as the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential., chapter 11. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case., section II.5. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.\n\nIn the context of finite groups exponentiation is given by repeatedly multiplying one group element b with itself. The discrete logarithm is the integer n solving the equation\nb^n = x,\\,\nwhere x is an element of the group. Carrying out the exponentiation can be done efficiently, but the discrete logarithm is believed to be very hard to calculate in some groups. This asymmetry has important applications in public key cryptography, such as for example in the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, a routine that allows secure exchanges of cryptographic keys over unsecured information channels. Zech's logarithm is related to the discrete logarithm in the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of a finite field.\n\nFurther logarithm-like inverse functions include the double logarithm ln(ln(x)), the super- or hyper-4-logarithm (a slight variation of which is called iterated logarithm in computer science), the Lambert W function, and the logit. They are the inverse functions of the double exponential function, tetration, of , and of the logistic function, respectively., p. 357\n\nRelated concepts\n\nFrom the perspective of group theory, the identity  expresses a group isomorphism between positive reals under multiplication and reals under addition. Logarithmic functions are the only continuous isomorphisms between these groups., section V.4.1 By means of that isomorphism, the Haar measure (Lebesgue measure) dx on the reals corresponds to the Haar measure  on the positive reals., section 1.4\n\nLogarithmic one-forms  appear in complex analysis and algebraic geometry as differential forms with logarithmic poles., section 2\n\nThe polylogarithm is the function defined by\n\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(z) \\sum_{k\n1}^\\infty {z^k \\over k^s}.\n\nIt is related to the natural logarithm by . Moreover,  equals the Riemann zeta function .",
