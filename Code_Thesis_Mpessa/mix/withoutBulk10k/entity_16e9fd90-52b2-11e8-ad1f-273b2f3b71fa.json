It is a multi-party system whereby the executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers as the head of government, as well as the President of Iraq, and legislative power is vested in the Council of Representatives and the Federation Council.\n\nThe current Prime Minister of Iraq is Haider al-Abadi, who holds most of the executive authority and appointed the Council of Ministers. which acts as a cabinet and/or government.The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Iraq as \"hybrid regime\" in 2016.\n\nGovernment\n\nFederal government\n\nThe federal government of Iraq is defined under the current Constitution as an Islamic,Constitution of Iraq, Section 1, Article 2 democratic, federal parliamentary republic.Constitution of Iraq, Section 1, Article 1 The federal government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as numerous independent commissions.\n\nThe legislative branch is composed of the Council of Representatives and a Federation Council.Constitution of Iraq, Section 3, Chapter 1, Article 48.

Both regions and  governorates are given broad autonomy with regions given additional powers such as control of internal security forces for the region such as police, security forces, and guards.Constitution of Iraq, Article 121 The last local elections for the governorates were held in the 2009 Iraqi governorate elections on 31 January 2009.\n\nRegions\n\nThe constitution requires that the Council of Representatives enact a law which provides the procedures for forming a new region 6 months from the start of its first session.Constitution of Iraq, Article 114 A law was passed  11 October 2006 by a unanimous vote with only 138 of 275 representatives present, with the remaining representatives boycotting the vote. Legislators from the Iraqi Accord Front, Sadrist Movement and Islamic Virtue Party all opposed the bill.\n\nUnder the law, a region can be created out of one or more existing governorates or two or more existing regions, and a governorate can also join an existing region to create a new region. A new region can be proposed by one third or more of the council members in each affected governorate plus 500 voters or by one tenth or more voters in each affected governorate.

The 275-member National Assembly was a parliament created under the Transitional Law during the Occupation of Iraq. The newly elected transitional Assembly was given a mandate to write the new and permanent Constitution of Iraq and exercised legislative functions until the new Constitution came into effect, and resulted in the formation of the Iraqi Transitional Government.\n\nThe United Iraqi Alliance, tacitly backed by Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, led with some 48% of the vote. The Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was in second place with some 26% of the vote. Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's party, the Iraqi List, came third with some 14%. In total, twelve parties received enough votes to win a seat in the assembly.\n\nLow Arab Sunni turnout threatened the legitimacy of the election, which was as low as 2% in Anbar province. More than 100 armed attacks on polling places took place, killing at least 44 people (including nine suicide bombers) across Iraq, including at least 20 in Baghdad.\n\nIraqi parliamentary election, December 2005\n\nFollowing the ratification of the Constitution of Iraq on 15 October 2005, a general election was held on 15 December to elect the permanent 275-member Iraqi Council of Representatives.\n\nThe elections took place under a list system, whereby voters chose from a list of parties and coalitions. 230 seats were apportioned among Iraq's 18 governorates based on the number of registered voters in each as of the January 2005 elections, including 59 seats for Baghdad Governorate.[http://www.ieciraq.org/final%20cand/IECI%20ApportionmentofGovernorateSeats%20English_new.pdf local election results] The seats within each governorate were allocated to lists through a system of Proportional Representation. An additional 45 \"compensatory\" seats were allocated to those parties whose percentage of the national vote total (including out of country votes) exceeds the percentage of the 275 total seats that they have been allocated. Women were required to occupy 25% of the 275 seats. The change in the voting system gave more weight to Arab Sunni voters, who make up most of the voters in several provinces. It was expected that these provinces would thus return mostly Sunni Arab representatives, after most Sunnis boycotted the last election.\n\nTurnout was high (79.6%).  The White House was encouraged by the relatively low levels of violence during polling, with one insurgent group making good on a promised election day moratorium on attacks, even going so far as to guard the voters from attack. President Bush frequently pointed to the election as a sign of progress in rebuilding Iraq. However, post-election violence threatened to plunge the nation into civil war, before the situation began to calm in 2007. The election results themselves produced a shaky coalition government headed by Nouri al-Maliki.\n\nIraqi parliamentary election, 2010\n\nA parliamentary election was held in Iraq on 7 March 2010. The election decided the 325 members of the Council of Representatives of Iraq who will elect the Iraqi Prime Minister and President. The election resulted in a partial victory for the Iraqi National Movement, led by former Interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, which won a total of 91 seats, making it the largest alliance in the Council.  The State of Law Coalition, led by incumbent Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, was the second largest grouping with 89 seats.\n\nThe election was rife with controversy. Prior to the election, the Supreme Court in Iraq ruled that the existing electoral law/rule was unconstitutional,[http://gulfanalysis.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/the-2005-election-law-seen-as-unconstitutional-seat-distribution-key-in-doubt/ The 2005 Election Law Seen as Unconstitutional; Seat Distribution Key in Doubt] and a new elections law made changes in the electoral system.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125770031185936775 Iraq Passes Key Election Law and Prepares for January Vote ] On 15 January 2010, the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) banned 499 candidates from the election due to alleged links with the Ba'ath Party. Before the start of the campaign on 12 February 2010, IHEC confirmed that most of the appeals by banned candidates had been rejected and 456 of the initially banned candidates would not be allowed to run for the election. There were numerous allegations of fraud, and a recount of the votes in Baghdad was ordered on 19 April 2010. On May 14, IHEC announced that after 11,298 ballot boxes had been recounted, there was no sign of fraud or violations.\n\nThe new parliament opened on 14 June 2010. After months of fraught negotiations, an agreement was reached on the formation of a new government on November 11. Talabani would continue as president, Al-Maliki would stay on as prime minister and Allawi would head a new security council.\n\nIraqi parliamentary election, 2014\n\nParliamentary elections were held in Iraq on 30 April 2014. The elections decided the 328 members of the Council of Representatives who will in turn elect the Iraqi President and Prime Minister.\n\nIssues\n\nCorruption\n\nAccording to Transparency International, Iraq's is the most corrupt government in the Middle East, and is described as a \"hybrid regime\" (between a \"flawed democracy\" and an \"authoritarian regime\"). The 2011 report \"Costs of War\" from Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies concluded that U.S. military presence in Iraq has not been able to prevent this corruption, noting that as early as 2006, \"there were clear signs that post-Saddam Iraq was not going to be the linchpin for a new democratic Middle East.\"",
