  "textBody" : "Jazz dancing, and its steps and style, originated from the dancing of African Americans that were brought to America as slaves.Barnes, Clive. \"Attitudes.\" Dance Magazine. Aug. 2004: 98. Web. Originally, the term jazz dance encompassed any dance done to jazz music, including both tap dance and jitterbug.\n\nOver time, a clearly defined jazz genre emerged, changing from a street dance to a theatrical dance performed on stage by professionals. Some scholars and dancers, especially Swing and Lindy Hop dancers, still regard the term jazz dance. It is a genre which has produced specific styles from famous choreographers such as Bob Fosse, Jack Cole, and Katherine Dunham. Jazz dance can refer to these specific styles or allude to theatrical or character dance. However, the style continues to adapt and is commonly seen on dance competition stages being performed in a very sassy manner with a lot of attitude. Some people think Jazz dance produced modern jazz, but really, Modern dance came more as a response against Ballet. Two main branches of Modern dance were pioneered through Martha Graham and Isadora Duncan.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term was first used to describe dances done to the new-fangled jazz music of the early 20th century, but its origin lies in the dances brought from Africa by slaves shipped to America. At that time, it referred to any dance done to jazz music, which included both tap dance and jitterbug. A defining feature was its \"free conversation-like style of improvisation.\" Carter, Curtis. \"Improvisation in Dance.\" The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 58, no. 2, 181-90. Accessed April 24, 2015. jstor.org.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the 1920s, ballet was connected to both, jazz music and dancing, when the term ‘jazz ballet’ was spreading around the world. That was practically the beginning of new “non-jazz” jazz dance. That was followed by Modern dance-based attempts to define “modern jazz dance” without a real connection to authentic jazz dance forms. These attempts were named collectively “modern jazz dance” by the end of the 1950s.Harri Heinilä, An Endeavor by Harlem Dancers to Achieve Equality – The Recognition of the Harlem-Based African-American Jazz Dance Between 1921 and 1943, pages 57-61 and 407.  \"Modern jazz dance\" was defined by the end of the 1960s.

Web.\n\nDuring this time, choreographers from other genres experimented with the style., including George Balanchine, Agnes de Mille, Jack Cole, Hanya Holm, Helen Tamiris, Michael Kidd, Jerome Robbins, and Bob Fosse. All of these choreographers influenced jazz by requiring highly trained dancers and introducing steps from ballet and contemporary dance. In the 1950s, jazz dance was profoundly influenced by Caribbean and Latin American influences, introduced by Katherine Dunham.\"Katherine Dunham's Brilliant Legacy.\" The Art of Dance.

Isolations are the movements in one part of the body specifically, while the other parts remain still.\n\nA low center of gravity, high energy level, isolations, and style are all characteristics used to identify jazz dance. Other elements of jazz dance are less common and are the stylizations of their respective choreographers. One such example are the inverted limbs and hunched-over posture of Bob Fosse.\n\nJazz dance is now competed and performed through North America and many other countries across the world.
