  "textBody" : "Max and Moritz (A Story of Seven Boyish Pranks) (original: Max und Moritz – Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen) is a German language illustrated story in verse. This highly inventive, blackly humorous tale, told entirely in rhymed couplets, was written and illustrated by Wilhelm Busch and published in 1865. It is among the early works of Busch, nevertheless it already features many substantial, effectually aesthetic and formal regularities, procedures and basic patterns of Busch's later works. Many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the Katzenjammer Kids and Quick & Flupke. The German title satirizes the German custom of giving a subtitle to the name of dramas in the form of \"Ein Drama in ... Akten\" (A Drama in ... Acts), which became dictum in colloquial usage for any event with an unpleasant or dramatic course, e.g. \"Bundespräsidentenwahl - Drama in drei Akten\" (Federal Presidential Elections - Drama in Three Acts).\n\nCultural significance \n\nBusch's classic tale of the terrible duo (now in the public domain) has since become a proud part of the culture in German-speaking countries. Even today, parents usually read these tales to their not-yet-literate children. To this day in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, a certain familiarity with the story and its rhymes is still presumed, as it is often referenced in mass communication. The two leering faces are synonymous with mischief, and appear almost logo-like in advertising and even graffiti.\n\nDuring World War 1, the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen, named his dog Moritz, giving the name Max to another animal given to his friend.\n\nMax and Moritz is the first published original foreign children’s book in Japan which was translated into rōmaji by Shinjirō Shibutani and Kaname Oyaizu in 1887 as ' (\"Naughty stories\").\n\nMax and Moritz became the forerunners to the comic strip. The story inspired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids.Derleth, August in Dirks, Rudolph: The Katzenjammer Kids, Dover Publications, New York 1974\n\nAfter World War 2, German-U.S. composer Richard Mohaupt created together with choreographer Alfredo Bortoluzzi the dance burlesque (Tanzburleske) Max und Moritz, which premiered at Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe on December 18, 1949.\n\nThe pranks \n\nThere have been several English translations of the original German verses over the years, but all have maintained the original trochaic tetrameter:\n\nPreface \n\nAh, how oft we read or hear of \nBoys we almost stand in fear of!\nFor example, take these stories\nOf two youths, named Max and Moritz,\nWho, instead of early turning\nTheir young minds to useful learning,\nOften leered with horrid features\nAt their lessons and their teachers.\n\nLook now at the empty head: he\nIs for mischief always ready.\nTeasing creatures - climbing fences,\nStealing apples, pears, and quinces,\nIs, of course, a deal more pleasant,\nAnd far easier for the present,\nThan to sit in schools or churches,\nFixed like roosters on their perches\n\nBut O dear, O dear, O deary,\nWhen the end comes sad and dreary!\n'Tis a dreadful thing to tell\nThat on Max and Moritz fell!\nAll they did this book rehearses,\nBoth in pictures and in verses.\n\nFirst Trick: The Widow \n\nThe boys tie several crusts of bread together with thread, and lay this trap in the chicken yard of Bolte, an old widow, causing all the chickens to become fatally entangled.\n\nThis prank is remarkably similar to the eighth history of the classic German prankster tales of Till Eulenspiegel.\n\nSecond Trick: The Widow II \n\nAs the widow cooks her chickens, the boys sneak onto her roof. When she leaves her kitchen momentarily, the boys steal the chickens using a fishing pole down the chimney. The widow hears her dog barking and hurries upstairs, finds the hearth empty and beats the dog.\n\nThird Trick: The Tailor \n\nThe boys torment Böck, a well-liked tailor who has a fast stream flowing in front of his house. They saw through the planks of his wooden bridge, making a precarious gap, then taunt him by making goat noises (a pun on his name being similar to the zoological expression 'buck'), until he runs outside. The bridge breaks; the tailor is swept away and nearly drowns (but for two geese, which he grabs a hold of and which fly high to safety).\n\nAlthough Till removes the planks of the bridge instead of sawing them there are some similarities to Till Eulenspiegel (32nd History).\n\nFourth Trick: The Teacher \n\nWhile their devout teacher, Lämpel, is busy at church, the boys invade his home and fill his favorite pipe with gunpowder. When he lights the pipe, the blast knocks him unconscious, blackens his skin and burns away all his hair. But: \"Time that comes will quick repair; yet the pipe retains its share.\"\n\nFifth Trick: The Uncle \n\nThe boys collect bags full of May bugs, which they promptly deposit in their Uncle Fritz's bed. Uncle is nearly asleep when he feels the bugs walking on his nose. Horrified, he goes into a frenzy, killing them with a shoe.\n\nSixth Trick: The Baker \n\nThe boys invade a bakery which they believe is closed. Attempting to steal pretzels, they fall into a vat of dough. The baker returns, catches the breaded pair, and bakes them. But they survive, and escape by gnawing through their crusts.\n\nFinal Trick: The Farmer \n\nHiding out in the grain storage area of a farmer, Mecke, the boys slit some grain sacks. Carrying away one of the sacks, farmer Mecke immediately notices the problem. He puts the boys in the sack instead, then takes it to the mill. The boys are ground to bits and devoured by the miller’s ducks. Later, no one expresses regret.\n(The mill really exists in Ebergötzen, Germany, and can be visited)\n\nMedia adaptations\n\nMax und Moritz was adapted into a ballet by Richard Mohaupt and Alfredo Bortuluzzi.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/busch.htm In 1956 Norbert Schultze adapted it into a straightforward children's film, Max und Moritz (1956),https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/busch.htm while Thomas Frydetzki and Annette Stefan made a more loose, satirical adaptation in 2005 named Max und Moritz Reloaded.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/busch.htm The comic was also adapted into two 1978 animated TV specials.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/busch.htm",
