Cornish Language Partnership. is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England. It is 208 km2 in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.\n\nThe name Bodmin Moor is relatively recent, an Ordnance Survey invention of 1813. The upland area was formerly known as Fowey Moor after the River Fowey, which rises within it.; p. 72\n\nGeography\n\nBodmin Moor is one of five granite plutons in Cornwall that make up part of the Cornubian batholith (see also Geology of Cornwall).\n\nDramatic granite tors rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall at 417 m, and Rough Tor at 400 m. To the south-east Kilmar Tor and Caradon Hill are the most prominent hills. Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.\n\nThe moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies. Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Bodmin Moor, North, and has been officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB.[http://www.cornwall-aonb.gov.uk/documents/12_bodmin_character.pdf]   Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.  The moor has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of European stonechats as well as a wintering population of 10,000 Eurasian golden plovers. The moor has also been recognised as a separate natural region and designated as national character area 153 by Natural England.[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/publications/nca/bodmin_moor.aspx]  \n\nRivers and inland waters\n\nBodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south.\n\nThe River Fowey rises at a height of 290 m and flows through Lostwithiel and into the Fowey estuary.\n\nThe River Tiddy rises near Pensilva and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Lynher (the Lynher flows generally south-east until it joins the Hamoaze near Plymouth). The River Inny rises near Davidstow and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Tamar.\n\nThe River Camel rises on Hendraburnick Down and flows for approximately 40 km before joining the sea at Padstow. The River Camel and its tributary the De Lank River are an important habitat for the otter, and both have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) The De Lank River rises near Roughtor and flows along an irregular course before joining the Camel south of Wenford.\n\nThe River Warleggan rises near Temple and flows south to join the Fowey.\n\nOn the southern slopes of the moor lies Dozmary Pool. It is Cornwall's only natural inland lake and is glacial in origin. In the 20th century three reservoirs have been constructed on the moor; these are Colliford Lake, Siblyback Lake and Crowdy reservoirs, which supply water for a large part of the county's population. Various species of waterfowl are resident around these waters.Bere, Rennie (1982) The Nature of Cornwall.

There are several documented cases of flint scatters being discovered by archaeologists, indicating that these hunter-gatherers practised flint knapping in the region.\n\nDuring the Neolithic era, from about 4,500 to 2,300 BC, people began clearing trees and farming the land. It was also in this era that the production of various megalithic monuments began, predominantly long cairns (three of which have currently been identified, at Louden, Catshole and Bearah) and stone circles (sixteen of which have been identified). It was also likely that the naturally forming tors were also viewed in a similar manner to the manmade ceremonial sites.\n\nIn the following Bronze Age, the creation of monuments increased dramatically, with the production of over 300 further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. More than 200 Bronze Age settlements with enclosures and field patterns have been recorded. and many prehistoric stone barrows and circles lie scattered across the moor.

Granite boulders were also taken from the moor and used for stone posts and to a certain extent for building (such material is known as moorstone).Clifton-Taylor, A. \"Building materials\" in: Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall. 2nd ed.
