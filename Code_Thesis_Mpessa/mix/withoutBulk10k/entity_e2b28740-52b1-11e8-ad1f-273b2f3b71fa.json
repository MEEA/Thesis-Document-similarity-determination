CMI's scientific activities are managed from the President's office in Oxford, United Kingdom. The institute is \"dedicated to increasing and disseminating mathematical knowledge.\" It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman Landon T. Clay. Harvard mathematician Arthur Jaffe was the first president of CMI. \n\nWhile the institute is best known for its Millennium Prize Problems, it carries out a wide range of activities, including a postdoctoral program (ten Clay Research Fellows are supported currently), conferences, workshops, and summer schools.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe institute is run according to a standard structure comprising a scientific advisory committee that decides on grant-awarding and research proposals, and a board of directors that oversees and approves the committee's decisions. , the board is made up of members of the Clay family, whereas the advisory committee is composed of leading authorities in mathematics, namely Sir Andrew Wiles, Michael Hopkins, Carlos Kenig, Andrei Okounkov, and Simon Donaldson.  Nicholas Woodhouse is the current president of CMI.\n\nMillennium Prize Problems\n\nThe institute is best known for establishing the Millennium Prize Problems on May 24, 2000. These seven problems are considered by CMI to be \"important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years.\" For each problem, the first person to solve it will be awarded $1,000,000 by the CMI. In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to Hilbert's problems, which were proposed in 1900, and had a substantial impact on 20th century mathematics. Of the initial 23 Hilbert problems, most of which have been solved, only the Riemann hypothesis (formulated in 1859) is included in the seven Millennium Prize Problems.Arthur Jaffe's first-hand account of how this Millennium Prize came about can be read in [http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-jaffe.pdf The Millennium Grand Challenge in Mathematics].\n\nFor each problem, the Institute had a professional mathematician write up an official statement of the problem, which will be the main standard by which a given solution will be measured against. The seven problems are:\n\n* P versus NP\n* The Hodge conjecture\n* The Poincaré conjecture—solved, by Grigori Perelman\n* The Riemann hypothesis\n* Yang–Mills existence and mass gap\n* Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness\n* The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture\n\nSome of the mathematicians who were involved in the selection and presentation of the seven problems were Atiyah, Bombieri, Connes, Deligne, Fefferman, Milnor, Mumford, Wiles, and Witten.\n\nOther awards\n\nThe Clay Research Award\n\nIn recognition of major breakthroughs in mathematical research, the institute has an annual prize — the Clay Research Award. Its recipients to date are Ian Agol, Manindra Agrawal, Yves Benoist, Manjul Bhargava, Danny Calegari, Alain Connes, Nils Dencker, Alex Eskin, David Gabai, Ben Green, Larry Guth, Christopher Hacon, Richard S.

The institute also has a yearly Clay Research Award, recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research. Finally, the institute organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians (from the high school to postdoctoral level).
