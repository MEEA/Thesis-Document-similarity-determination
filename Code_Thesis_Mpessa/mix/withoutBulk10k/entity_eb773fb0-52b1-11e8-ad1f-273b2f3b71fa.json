  "textBody" : "Dagome iudex is one of the earliest historical documents relating to Poland.  Poland is not mentioned by name, but reference is made to Dagome and Ote (Mieszko I and his wife, Oda von Haldensleben) and their sons in 991, placing their land (called \"Schinesghe\") under the protection of the Apostolic See. The document's name derives from its opening words.\n\nNature and import of the Dagome iudex\n\nThe Dagome iudex survives only in the form of a summary, completed c. 1080. It was found in a register compiled by a curial \ncardinal during the papacy of Gregory VII.\n\nMost historians believe that the word \"Dagome\" is a melding of two names:  the Christian \"Dago,\" for \"Dagobert\" (Mieszko's hypothetical baptismal name), and the Slavic \"Me,\" for \"Mieszko.\"  The Latin word \"iudex\" (\"judge\") would be used in the meaning of \"prince.\" Another interpretation is that \"Dagome iudex\" is a corruption of \"Ego Mesco dux\" (\"I, Prince Mieszko\"). In the Vatican copy the e of Dagome might have an s adscriptum (similar to cedilla), though just the Vatican copyist read iudex literally, relating it to Sardinia and its four \"judges\". \n \nPlace names are misspelled by the person who made the summary.  He was also apparently unaware that the document related to territory later called Poland.\n\nThe boundaries of the \"Gniezno\" state are described as extending to the \"Long Sea\" (the Baltic), Prussia, Rus', Kraków, Moravia and the Oder River. Lesser Poland is taken account by the mention of its capital, Kraków (\"craccoa\"). Between alemura, probably Olomouc, and Upper Lusatia region of the Milceni (terra mileze) When Lusatia came in sight of medieval writers, the  lived only in Lower Lusatia, the Milceni in Upper Lusatia. Later on, the term Lusatia (Lausitz, Lužice) was spread to the south. Therefore, nowaday's term Lusatian Mountains does not totally fit with the history of settlement. the border could include Silesia if it was straight.\n\nThe text seems to use ciuitas schinesghe  as a synonyme of Greater Poland. Otherwise, the description of the boundaries would be rather more logical, if schenisghe meant the city of Szczecin. Of other regions and places in Mieszko's territory, it mentions only Kraków and Lusatia, both without fines (border). Regions outside Mieszko's rule, pruzze (Prussia) and russe (Ruthenia), are mentioned with the word fines.\n\nThe Dagome iudex is of capital importance for Polish history in giving a general description of the future Polish state in that period.  It, however, leaves unanswered many questions.  First, it does not explain why Mieszko I placed his state under the protection of the Pope.  Also, it is unclear why the document does not mention Mieszko's eldest son, Bolesław I the Brave.  Mentioned instead are his sons by his second wife, Oda. No mention is made of the third son from that marriage, Świętopełk, either.\" Finally, Mieszko I is not referred to as \"Dagome\" in any other document.\n\nHistorians suppose that Bolesław's absence from the document might be explained by an old Slavic custom whereby children received their inheritance as soon as they reached the age of majority. Thus Bolesław the Brave might have received Kraków as his part of his father's legacy before the Dagome iudex had been written.\n\nText of the Dagome iudex\n\n* In the Latin:\nItem in alio tomo sub Iohanne XV papa Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum: Misicam et Lambertus - nescio cuius gentis homines, puto autem Sardos fuisse, quoniam ipsi a IIII iudicibus reguntur - leguntur beato Petro contulisse unam civitatem in integro, que vocatur Schinesghe, cum omnibus suis pertinentiis infra hos affines, sicuti incipit a primo latere longum mare, fine Bruzze usque in locum, qui dicitur Russe et fines Russe extendente usque in Craccoa et ab ipsa Craccoa usque ad flumen Oddere recte in locum, qui dicitur Alemure, et ab ipsa Alemura usque in terram Milze recte intra Oddere et exinde ducente iuxta flumen Oddera usque in predictam civitatem Schinesghe.\n*In English translation:\n\"Also in another volume from the times of Pope John XV, Dagome,\"Dagome\" is commonly identified as Mieszko I.
