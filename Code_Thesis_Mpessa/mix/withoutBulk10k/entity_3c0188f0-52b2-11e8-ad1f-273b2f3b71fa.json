Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary., Modern ' Tiberian ' ISO 259-3 ';  Mūše;  ';  ' was a prophet in the Abrahamic religions. According to the Hebrew Bible, he was adopted by an Egyptian princess, and later in life became the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew (, lit. \"Moses our Teacher\"), he is the most important prophet in Judaism.. He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and a number of other Abrahamic religions.\n\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.Exodus 1:10 Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).\n\nGod sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak eloquently,Exodus 4:10 so God allowed Aaron, his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the Promised Land on Mount Nebo.\n\nScholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person. Rabbinic Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE;Seder Olam Rabbah Jerome gives 1592 BCE,Jerome's Chronicon (4th century) gives 1592 for the birth of Moses and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year.The 17th-century Ussher chronology calculates 1571 BC (Annals of the World, 1658 paragraph 164) In Book of Deuteronomy, Moses was mentioned as \"the man of God.\"[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter_33 Deuteronomy 33: 1]\n\nName\n\nThe Biblical account of Moses' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name.Naomi E.

This explanation links it to a verb mashah, meaning \"to draw out\", which makes the Pharaoh's daughter's declaration a play on words. The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his future role in legend, as someone who will \"draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea.\"\n\nSeveral etymologies have been proposed. An Egyptian root msy, \"child of\", has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses (Thoth created him) and Ramesses (Ra created him),Christopher B. Hays, [https://books.google.it/books?id\nr5W7BwAAQBAJ&pgPA116 Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East], Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2014 p. 116. with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines \"water\" or \"seed\" and \"pond, expanse of water\", thus yielding the sense of \"child of the Nile\" (mw-še).Rivka Ulmer, [https://books.google.it/books?id\nwKH3qsGzlb0C&pg=PA269 Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash], de gruyter 2009 p. 269.\n\nThe Hebrew etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses' Egyptian origins. The Egyptian character of his name was recognized as such by ancient Jewish writers like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.Franz V.

At this time Moses was born to his father Amram, son of Kehath the Levite, who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was Jochebed (also Yocheved), who was kin to Kehath. Moses had one older (by seven years) sister, Miriam, and one older (by three years) brother, Aaron.\n\nThe Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses' mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter.  One day after Moses had reached adulthood he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to Midian (a desert country south of Judah), where he married Zipporah.\n\nThere, on Mount Horeb, God revealed to Moses his name YHWH (probably pronounced Yahweh) and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his chosen people (Israel) out of bondage and into the Promised Land (Canaan)..  During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but Zipporah saved his life. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to ten plagues did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea Crossing as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol III : Chapter I] (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.\n\nFrom Egypt, Moses led the Israelites to biblical Mount Sinai, where he was given the Ten Commandments from God, written on stone tablets. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a golden calf and worshiped it, thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the idolaters. He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted the priesthood under the sons of Moses' brother Aaron, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the Tabernacle, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol III : The Symbolical Significance of the Tabernacle] (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.\n\nFrom Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the Desert of Paran on the border of Canaan. From there he sent twelve spies into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were giants.  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol III : Ingratitude Punished] (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.\n\nWhen the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the Dead Sea to the territories of Edom and Moab.  There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, received God's blessing through Balaam the prophet, and massacred the Midianites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in Numbers 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on Mount Abarim, and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.\n\nOn the banks of the Jordan River, in sight of the land, Moses assembled the tribes. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a song of praise and pronounced a blessing on the people, and passed his authority to Joshua, under whom they would possess the land.  Moses then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty. More humble than any other man (Num. 12:3), \"there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom YHWH knew face to face\" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The New Testament states that after Moses' death, Michael the Archangel and the Devil disputed over his body (Epistle of Jude 1:9).\n\nLawgiver of Israel\n\nMoses is honoured among Jews today as the \"lawgiver of Israel\", and he delivers several sets of laws in the course of the four books. The first is the Covenant Code (Exodus –), the terms of the covenant which God offers to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. Embedded in the covenant are the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:1–17) and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 20:22–23:19). The entire Book of Leviticus constitutes a second body of law, the Book of Numbers begins with yet another set, and the Book of Deuteronomy another. \n\nMoses has traditionally been regarded as the author of those four books and the Book of Genesis, which together comprise the Torah, the first and most revered section of the Hebrew Bible. \n\nHistoricity\n\nThe scholarly consensus is that the figure of Moses is legendary, and not historical,William G. Dever 'What Remains of the House That Albright Built?,' in George Ernest Wright, Frank Moore Cross, Edward Fay Campbell, Floyd Vivian Filson (eds.) The Biblical Archaeologist, American Schools of Oriental Research, Scholars Press, Vol. 56, No 1, 2 March 1993 pp.25-35,  p.33: 'the overwhelming scholarly consensus today is that Moses is a mythical figure.' although a \"Moses-like figure may have existed somewhere in the southern Transjordan in the mid-late 13th century B.C.\" Certainly no Egyptian sources mention Moses or the events of Exodus-Deuteronomy, nor has any archaeological evidence been discovered in Egypt or the Sinai wilderness to support the story in which he is the central figure. The story of his discovery picks up a familiar motif in ancient Near Eastern mythological accounts of the ruler who rises from humble origins: Thus Sargon of Akkad's Akkadian account of his origins runs;\nMy mother, the high priestess, conceived; in secret she bore me\nShe set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid\nShe cast me into the river which rose over me.Timothy D.

William Albright believed in the essential historicity of the biblical tales of Moses and the Exodus, accepting however that the core narrative had been overlaid by legendary accretions. Biblical minimalists such as Philip R. Davies and Niels Peter Lemche regard all biblical books, and the stories of an Exodus, united monarchy, exile and return as fictions composed by a social elite in Yehud in the Persian period or even later, the purpose being to legitimize a return to indigenous roots.Michael R.Stead, [https://books.google.it/books?id\ny6KoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 The Intertextuality of Zechariah 1–8: Ideals and Realities,] T&T Clark 2009 p.42\n\nDespite the imposing fame associated with Moses, no source mentions him until he emerges in texts associated with the Babylonian exile.George W.

A theory developed by Cornelius Tiele in 1872, which had proved influential, argued that Yahweh was a Midianite god, introduced to the Israelites by Moses,  whose father-in-law Jethro was a Midianite priest.Judges  1:16;3:11; Numbers  10:29); Exodus 6:2-3 It was to such a Moses that Yahweh reveals his real name, hidden from the Patriarchs who knew him only as El Shaddai.Mark S.

Mesha also is associated with narratives of an exodus and a conquest, and several motifs in stories about him are shared with the Exodus tale and that regarding Israel's war with Moab (2 Kings 3). Moab rebels against oppression, like Moses, leads his people out of Israel, as Moses does from Egypt, and his first-born son is slaughtered at the wall of Kir-hareseth as the firstborn of Israel are condemned to slaughter in the Exodus story, \"an infernal passover that delivers Mesha while wrath burns against his enemies\".Peter J.

The lepers are bundled into Avaris, the former capital of the Hyksos, where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years – Osarseph then assumes the name Moses - and are then driven out.Jan Assmann, [https://books.google.it/books?idIjUiie30Z9cC&pg\nPA33 Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism,] Harvard University Press, 2009 pp.31-34.\n\nMoses in Hellenistic literature\n\nNon-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, from 323 BCE to about 146 BCE. Shmuel notes that \"a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples.\"\n\nIn addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians Artapanus, Eupolemus, Josephus, and Philo, a few non-Jewish historians including Hecataeus of Abdera (quoted by Diodorus Siculus), Alexander Polyhistor, Manetho, Apion, Chaeremon of Alexandria, Tacitus and Porphyry also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown. Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the Mishnah (c. 200 CE), Midrash (200–1200 CE),. and the Quran (c. 610–53).\n\nThe figure of Osarseph in Hellenistic historiography is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.\n\nIn Hecataeus\n\nThe earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of Hecataeus of Abdera (4th century BCE). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by Diodorus Siculus, wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, \"he describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized Judaea.\"  Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:\n\nDroge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by Eupolemus.\n\nIn Artapanus\n\nThe Jewish historian Artapanus of Alexandria (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus \"clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people.\"Barclay, John M. G. Jews in the Mediterranean Diaspora: From Alexander to Trajan (323 BCE – 117 CE), University of California Press (1996) p. 130\n\nArtapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of YHWH in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian temples of Isis thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses' miracles. He describes Moses as 80 years old, \"tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified.\"\n\nSome historians, however, point out the \"apologetic nature of much of Artapanus' work,\" with his addition of extra-biblical details, such as his references to Jethro: the non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses' gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.\n\nIn Strabo\n\nStrabo, a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his Geographica (c. 24 CE), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything – land and sea:\n\nIn Strabo's writings of the history of Judaism as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where \"the Temple of Jerusalem continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.\"  Strabo's \"positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses' personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature.\" His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of Hecataeus who \"described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage.\"\n\nEgyptologist Jan Assmann concludes that Strabo was the historian \"who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as monotheistic and as a pronounced counter-religion.\" It recognized \"only one divine being whom no image can represent... [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice.\"\n\nIn Tacitus\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56–120 CE) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes Jewish philosophy, is his Histories (c. 100), where, according to Arthur Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, \"pagan mythology fell into contempt.\"Tacitus, Cornelius. The works of Cornelius Tacitus: With an essay on his life and genius by Arthur Murphy, Thomas Wardle Publ. (1842) p. 499 Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh Bocchoris, suffering from a plague, banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god Zeus-Amun.\n\nIn this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the Holy Land on the seventh.Tacitus, Cornelius.

Aside from a reference to Cicero, Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, contextually he is put on a par with Homer,. and he is described \"with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as Hecataeus and Strabo.\n\nIn Josephus\n\nIn Josephus' (37 – c. 100 CE) Antiquities of the Jews,  Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple, at the time the Ark of the Covenant was first moved into the newly built temple:\n\nAccording to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses' possession of the \"cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.\" He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he \"stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like Plato's philosopher-king, Moses excels as an educator.\"\n\nIn Numenius\n\nNumenius, a Greek philosopher who was a native of Apamea, in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that \"Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of Jesus...\"  He describes his background:\n\nIn Justin Martyr\n\nThe Christian saint and religious philosopher Justin Martyr (103–165 CE) drew the same conclusion as Numenius, according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be \"more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is older than the Greek philosophers.\"  He quotes him:\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism\n\nMost of what is known about Moses from the Bible comes from the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the Persian period, 538–332 BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions.Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, p.68Jean-Louis Ska, [https://books.google.com./books?id7g4yqsv0S0cC&pg\nPA260The Exegesis of the Pentateuch: Exegetical Studies and Basic Questions,] Forschungen zum Alten Testament, Vol 66, Mohr Siebeck, 2009 p.260. There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the Jewish apocrypha and in the genre of rabbinical exegesis known as Midrash, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The Midrash identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names.Midrash Rabbah, Ki Thissa, XL. 3-3, Lehrman, p. 463 Moses' other names were: Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by his father), Jered (by Miriam), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), Avi Gedor (by Kohath), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel).Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot 166 to Chronicles I 4:18, 24:6; also see Vayikra Rabbah 1:3; Chasidah p.345 Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman,Rashi to Bava Batra 15s, Chasidah p. 345 Mechoqeiq (lawgiver)Bava Batra 15a on Deuteronomy 33:21, Chasidah p. 345 and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3).Rashi to Berachot 54a, Chasidah p. 345 In another exegesis, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the seventh, even visited Paradise and Hell alive, after he saw the Divine vision in Mount Horeb.Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

Artapanus of Alexandria explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/Hermes, but also with the Greek figure Musaeus (whom he called \"the teacher of Orpheus\"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.Eusebius, l.c. ix. 27\n\nTo Orthodox Jews, Moses is called Moshe Rabbenu, `Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya\"a: \"Our Leader Moshe, Servant of God, Father of all the Prophets (may his merit shield us, amen)\".Honorifics for the dead in Judaism. In the orthodox view, Moses received not only the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the `hokhmat nistar teachings, which gave Judaism the Zohar of the Rashbi, the Torah of the Ari haQadosh and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the Ramhal and his masters). He is also considered the greatest prophet.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol. III : Moses excels all pious men] (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.\n\n\"Moses was one hundred and twenty (120) years old when he died\" (Deut. 34:7), and no one knows his burial place to this day (Deut. 34:6).\n\nArising in part from his age and that \"his eye had not dimmed, and his vigor had not diminished,\" the phrase \"may you live to 120\" has become a common blessing among Jews, especially since 120 is elsewhere stated as the maximum age for Noah's descendants (one interpretation of ).\n\nChristianity\n\nMoses is mentioned more often in the New Testament than any other Old Testament figure. For Christians, Moses is often a symbol of God's law, as reinforced and expounded on in the teachings of Jesus. New Testament writers often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In Acts 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshipped the golden calf is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.\n\nMoses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the Pharisee Nicodemus at night in the third chapter of the Gospel of John, he compared Moses' lifting up of the bronze serpent in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and resurrection) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them manna in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the \"bread of life\", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people. \n\nMoses, along with Elijah, is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three Gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Matthew 17, Mark 9, and Luke 9, respectively. Jesus refers to the scribes and the Pharisees of the Temple as \"seated in the chair of Moses\" (, epi tēs Mōuseōs kathedras) \n \n\nHis relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a saint by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective Calendars of Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Lutheran churches on September 4. In Eastern Orthodox liturgics for September 4, Moses is commemorated as the \"Holy Prophet and God-seer Moses, on Mount Nebo\".Great Synaxaristes:  [http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/552/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Προφήτης Μωϋσῆς]. 4 Σεπτεμβρίου.

The Orthodox Church also commemorates him on the Sunday of the Forefathers, two Sundays before the Nativity.[http://www.orthodoxengland.org.uk/sermhff.htm THE SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS]. St John's Orthodox Church, Colchester, Essex, England.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates him as one of the Holy Forefathers in their Calendar of Saints on July 30.\n\nMormonism\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (colloquially called Mormons) generally view Moses in the same way that other Christians do. However, in addition to accepting the biblical account of Moses, Mormons include Selections from the Book of Moses as part of their scriptural canon. This book is believed to be the translated writings of Moses, and is included in the Pearl of Great Price.\n\nLatter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death (translated). In addition, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the Kirtland Temple (located in Kirtland, Ohio) in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the \"keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.\"The Doctrine and Covenants [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/11#11 110:11]\n\nIslam\n\nMoses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other Islamic prophet.  In general, Moses is described in ways which parallel the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and \"his character exhibits some of the main themes of Islamic theology,\" including the \"moral injunction that we are to submit ourselves to God.\" \n\nMoses is defined in the Quran as both prophet (nabi) and messenger (rasul), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people. \n\nHuston Smith describes an account in the Quran of meetings in heaven between Moses and Muhammad, which Huston states were \"one of the crucial events in Muhammad's life,\" and resulted in Muslims observing 5 daily prayers..\n\nMoses is mentioned 502 times in the Quran; passages mentioning Moses include 2.49–61, 7.103–160, 10.75–93, 17.101–104, 20.9–97, 26.10–66, 27.7–14, 28.3–46, 40.23–30, 43.46–55, 44.17–31, and 79.15–25. and many others. Most of the key events in Moses' life which are narrated in the Bible are to be found dispersed through the different Surahs of the Quran, with a story about meeting Khidr which is not found in the Bible.\n\nIn the Moses story related by the Quran, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection. The Pharaoh's wife Asiya, not his daughter, found Moses floating in the waters of the Nile. She convinced the Pharaoh to keep him as their son because they were not blessed with any children. \n\nThe Quran's account has emphasized Moses' mission to invite the Pharaoh to accept God's divine message as well as give salvation to the Israelites. According to the Quran, Moses encourages the Israelites to enter Canaan, but they are unwilling to fight the Canaanites, fearing certain defeat. Moses responds by pleading to Allah that he and his brother Aaron be separated from the rebellious Israelites. After which the Israelites are made to wander for 40 years.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho. \n\nBaha'i Faith\n\nMoses is one of the most important of God's messengers in the Bahá'í Faith being designated a Manifestation of God.. An epithet of Moses in Baha'i scriptures is the One Who Conversed with God.\n\nImportant figures in the Baha’i religion, such as Abdul’l-Baha, have highlighted the fact that Moses, like Abraham, had none of the makings of a great man of history, but through God's assistance he was able achieve many great things. He is described as having been \"for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness,\" of having had a stammer, and of being \"much hated and detested\" by the Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians of his time. He is said to have been raised in an oppressive household, and to have been known, in Egypt, as a man who had committed murder – though he had done so in order to prevent an act of cruelty.\n\nNevertheless, like Abraham, through the assistance of God, he achieved great things and gained renown even beyond the Levant. Chief among these achievements was the freeing of his people, the Hebrews, from bondage in Egypt and leading \"them to the Holy Land.\" He is viewed as the one who bestowed on Israel 'the religious and the civil law' which gave them \"honour among all nations,\" and which spread their fame to different parts of the world.\n\nFurthermore, through the law, Moses is believed to have led the Hebrews 'to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period.’ Abdul’l-Baha asserts that the ancient Greek philosophers regarded \"the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection.\" Chief among these philosophers, he says, was Socrates who \"visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.\"\n\nMoses is further described as paving the way for Bahá'u'lláh and his ultimate revelation, and as a teacher of truth, whose teachings were in line with the customs of his time..\n\nLegacy\n\nPolitics and law\n\nIn a metaphorical sense in the Christian tradition, a \"Moses\" has been referred to as the leader who delivers the people from a terrible situation. Among the Presidents of the United States known to have used the symbolism of Moses were Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who referred to his supporters as \"the Moses generation.\".\n\nIn subsequent years, theologians linked the Ten Commandments with the formation of early democracy. Scottish theologian William Barclay described them as \"the universal foundation of all things… the law without which nationhood is impossible.  …Our society is founded upon it.. Pope Francis addressed the United States Congress in 2015 stating that all people need to \"keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation... [and] the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being.[https://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9391549/pope-remarks-full-text \"Pope Francis addresses Congress\"], Vox, Sept. 24, 2015\n\nAmerican history\n\nPilgrims\n\nReferences to Moses were used by the Puritans, who relied on the story of Moses to give meaning and hope to the lives of Pilgrims seeking religious and personal freedom in America. John Carver was the first governor of Plymouth colony and first signer of the Mayflower Compact, which he wrote in 1620 during the ship Mayflowers three-month voyage. He inspired the Pilgrims with a \"sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose,\" notes historian Jon Meacham, and was called the \"Moses of the Pilgrims.\". Early American writer James Russell Lowell noted the similarity of the founding of America by the Pilgrims to that of ancient Israel by Moses:\n\nFollowing Carver's death the following year, William Bradford was made governor. He feared that the remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: \"Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?\". William G. Dever explains the attitude of the Pilgrims: \"We considered ourselves the 'New Israel,' particularly we in America. And for that reason we knew who we were, what we believed in and valued, and what our 'manifest destiny' was.\".\n\nFounding Fathers of the United States\n\nOn July 4, 1776, immediately after the Declaration of Independence was officially passed, the Continental Congress asked John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to design a seal that would clearly represent a symbol for the new United States.  They chose the symbol of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom.  The Founding Fathers of the United States inscribed the words of Moses on the Liberty Bell: \"Proclaim Liberty thro' all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof.\" (Leviticus 25)\n\nUpon the death of George Washington in 1799, two thirds of his eulogies referred to him as \"America's Moses,\" with one orator saying that \"Washington has been the same to us as Moses was to the Children of Israel.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin, in 1788, saw the difficulties that some of the newly independent American states were having in forming a government, and proposed that until a new code of laws could be agreed to, they should be governed by \"the laws of Moses,\" as contained in the Old Testament..  He justified his proposal by explaining that the laws had worked in biblical times: \"The Supreme Being… having rescued them from bondage by many miracles, performed by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that chosen servant, in the presence of the whole nation, a constitution and code of laws for their observance.\n\nJohn Adams, 2nd President of the United States, stated why he relied on the laws of Moses over Greek philosophy for establishing the United States Constitution: \"As much as I love, esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers.  Swedish historian Hugo Valentin credited Moses as the \"first to proclaim the rights of man.\".\n\nSlavery and civil rights\n\nHistorian Gladys L. Knight describes how leaders who emerged during slavery time and after often personified the Moses symbol. \"The symbol of Moses was empowering in that it served to amplify a need for freedom.\"Knight, Gladys L. Icons of African American Protest Vol I, Greenwood (2009) p. 183 Therefore, when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 after freeing the slaves, Black Americans said they had lost \"their Moses\". Lincoln biographer Charles Carleton Coffin writes, \"The millions whom Abraham Lincoln delivered from slavery will ever liken him to Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\". Similarly, Harriet Tubman, who rescued approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, was also described as the \"Moses\" of her people..\n\nIn the 1960s, a leading figure in the civil rights movement was Martin Luther King Jr., who was called \"a modern Moses,\" and often referred to Moses in his speeches: \"The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom.\"\n\nIn popular culture\n\nLiterature\n\n*Thomas Mann's novella The Tables of the Law (1944) is a retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt, with Moses as its main character. \n\nIn Freud\n\nSigmund Freud, in his last book, Moses and Monotheism in 1939, postulated that Moses was an Egyptian nobleman who adhered to the monotheism of Akhenaten. Following a theory proposed by a contemporary biblical critic, Freud believed that Moses was murdered in the wilderness, producing a collective sense of patricidal guilt that has been at the heart of Judaism ever since. \"Judaism had been a religion of the father, Christianity became a religion of the son\", he wrote. The possible Egyptian origin of Moses and of his message has received significant scholarly attention..\n\nOpponents of this view observe that the religion of the Torah seems different from Atenism in everything except the central feature of devotion to a single god, although this has been countered by a variety of arguments, e.g. pointing out the similarities between the Hymn to Aten and Psalm 104. Freud's interpretation of the historical Moses is not well accepted among historians, and is considered pseudohistory by many.\n\nArt\n\nDepiction on U.S. government buildings\nMoses is depicted in several U.S. government buildings because of his legacy as a lawgiver. In the Library of Congress stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the Paul the Apostle. Moses is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in marble bas-reliefs in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in the United States Capitol. The plaque's overview states: \"Moses (c. 1350–1250 B.C.) Hebrew prophet and lawgiver; transformed a wandering people into a nation; received the Ten Commandments.\"[http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/relief-portrait-plaques-lawgivers/moses \"Moses relieve portrait\"], Architect of the Capitol\n\nThe other twenty-two figures have their profiles turned to Moses, which is the only forward-facing bas-relief..\n\nMoses appears eight times in carvings that ring the Supreme Court Great Hall ceiling. His face is presented along with other ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the Chief Justice of the United States' head. In the center of the 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden..\n\nMichelangelo's statue\nMichelangelo's statue of Moses in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome, is one of the most familiar masterpieces in the world. The horns the sculptor included on Moses' head are the result of a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible into the Latin Vulgate Bible with which Michelangelo was familiar. The Hebrew word taken from Exodus means either a \"horn\" or an \"irradiation.\" Experts at the Archaeological Institute of America show that the term was used when Moses \"returned to his people after seeing as much of the Glory of the Lord as human eye could stand,\" and his face \"reflected radiance.\"MacLean, Margaret. (ed) Art and Archaeology, Vol. VI, Archaeological Institute of America (1917) p. 97 In early Jewish art, moreover, Moses is often \"shown with rays coming out of his head.\"\n\nAnother author explains, \"When Saint Jerome translated the Old Testament into Latin, he thought no one but Christ should glow with rays of light — so he advanced the secondary translation. However, writer J. Stephen Lang points out that Jerome's version actually described Moses as \"giving off hornlike rays,\" and he \"rather clumsily translated it to mean 'having horns.'\" It has also been noted that he had Moses seated on a throne, yet Moses was never given the title of a King nor ever sat on such thrones.\n\nFilm and television\n*Moses was portrayed by Theodore Roberts in Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 silent film The Ten Commandments. Moses appeared as the central character in the 1956 DeMille movie, also called The Ten Commandments, in which he was portrayed by Charlton Heston. A television remake was produced in 2006.\n\n*Burt Lancaster played Moses in the 1975 television miniseries Moses the Lawgiver. \n\n*In the 1981 comedy film History of the World, Part I, Moses was portrayed by Mel Brooks.\n\n*Sir Ben Kingsley was the narrator of the 2007 animated film, The Ten Commandments.\n\n*Moses appeared as the central character in the 1998 DreamWorks Pictures' animated movie, The Prince of Egypt. He was voiced by Val Kilmer.\n\n*In the 2009 miniseries Battles BC, Moses was portrayed by Cazzey Louis Cereghino.\n\n*In the 2013 television miniseries The Bible, Moses was portrayed by actor William Houston.\n\n*Christian Bale portrayed Moses in Ridley Scott's 2014 film Exodus: Gods and Kings which portrayed Moses and Rameses II as being raised by Seti I as cousins. \n\n*Guilherme Winter portrayed Moses in Alexandre Avancini and Vivian De Oliveira 2015-2016 Brazilian miniseries Moisés y los diez mandamientos (original title: Os Dez Mandamentos).\n\nCriticism of Moses\n\nThomas Paine and Numbers 31:13-18\nIn the late eighteenth century, the deist Thomas Paine commented at length on Moses' Laws in The Age of Reason (1794, 1795, and 1807). Paine considered Moses to be a \"detestable villain\", and cited  as an example of his \"unexampled atrocities\".Paine, Thomas (1796) The Age of Reason, part II. In the passage, the Jewish army had returned from conquering the Midianites, and Moses has gone down to meet it:\n\nThe prominent atheist Richard Dawkins also made reference to these verses in his 2006 book, The God Delusion, concluding that Moses was \"not a great role model for modern moralists\".Dawkins, Richard (2006). The God Delusion Chapter 7. Bantam Press. \n\nHowever, some Jewish sources defend Moses' role. The Chasam Sofer emphasizes that this war was not fought at Moses' behest, but was commanded by God as an act of revenge against the Midianite women,. who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin. Rabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a \"powerful fable of lust and betrayal\", and that Moses' execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes.Grossman, Joel (2008), [http://libraryminyan.org/divreitorah/Jole%20Grossman%20-%20Matot.htm \"Matot\"] . Temple Beth Am Library Minyan. Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the Reform movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a cautionary tale, to \"warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior\".Levin, Alan J.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary., Modern ' Tiberian ' ISO 259-3 ';  Mūše;  ';  ' was a prophet in the Abrahamic religions. According to the Hebrew Bible, he was adopted by an Egyptian princess, and later in life became the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew (, lit. \"Moses our Teacher\"), he is the most important prophet in Judaism.. He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and a number of other Abrahamic religions.\n\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.Exodus 1:10 Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).\n\nGod sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak eloquently,Exodus 4:10 so God allowed Aaron, his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the Promised Land on Mount Nebo.\n\nScholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person. Rabbinic Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE;Seder Olam Rabbah Jerome gives 1592 BCE,Jerome's Chronicon (4th century) gives 1592 for the birth of Moses and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year.The 17th-century Ussher chronology calculates 1571 BC (Annals of the World, 1658 paragraph 164) In Book of Deuteronomy, Moses was mentioned as \"the man of God.\"[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter_33 Deuteronomy 33: 1]\n\nName\n\nThe Biblical account of Moses' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name.Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman, [https://books.google.it/books?id\nz4eaj09hscAC&pgPA5 A Concise History of the Jewish People], Rowman & Littlefield, (1995) 2005 p.5.

This explanation links it to a verb mashah, meaning \"to draw out\", which makes the Pharaoh's daughter's declaration a play on words. The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his future role in legend, as someone who will \"draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea.\"\n\nSeveral etymologies have been proposed. An Egyptian root msy, \"child of\", has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses (Thoth created him) and Ramesses (Ra created him),Christopher B. Hays, [https://books.google.it/books?id\nr5W7BwAAQBAJ&pgPA116 Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East], Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2014 p. 116. with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines \"water\" or \"seed\" and \"pond, expanse of water\", thus yielding the sense of \"child of the Nile\" (mw-še).Rivka Ulmer, [https://books.google.it/books?id\nwKH3qsGzlb0C&pg=PA269 Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash], de gruyter 2009 p. 269.\n\nThe Hebrew etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses' Egyptian origins. The Egyptian character of his name was recognized as such by ancient Jewish writers like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.Franz V. Greifenhagen, [https://books.google.it/books?idr1evAwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA63  Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map: Constructing Biblical Israel's Identity, ] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003 pp.60ff. p.62 n.65. p.63.

At this time Moses was born to his father Amram, son of Kehath the Levite, who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was Jochebed (also Yocheved), who was kin to Kehath. Moses had one older (by seven years) sister, Miriam, and one older (by three years) brother, Aaron.\n\nThe Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses' mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter.  One day after Moses had reached adulthood he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to Midian (a desert country south of Judah), where he married Zipporah.\n\nThere, on Mount Horeb, God revealed to Moses his name YHWH (probably pronounced Yahweh) and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his chosen people (Israel) out of bondage and into the Promised Land (Canaan)..  During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but Zipporah saved his life. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to ten plagues did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea Crossing as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol III : Chapter I] (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.\n\nFrom Egypt, Moses led the Israelites to biblical Mount Sinai, where he was given the Ten Commandments from God, written on stone tablets. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a golden calf and worshiped it, thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the idolaters. He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted the priesthood under the sons of Moses' brother Aaron, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the Tabernacle, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land.Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

From there he sent twelve spies into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were giants.  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, received God's blessing through Balaam the prophet, and massacred the Midianites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in Numbers 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on Mount Abarim, and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.\n\nOn the banks of the Jordan River, in sight of the land, Moses assembled the tribes. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a song of praise and pronounced a blessing on the people, and passed his authority to Joshua, under whom they would possess the land.  Moses then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty. More humble than any other man (Num. 12:3), \"there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom YHWH knew face to face\" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The New Testament states that after Moses' death, Michael the Archangel and the Devil disputed over his body (Epistle of Jude 1:9).\n\nLawgiver of Israel\n\nMoses is honoured among Jews today as the \"lawgiver of Israel\", and he delivers several sets of laws in the course of the four books. The first is the Covenant Code (Exodus –), the terms of the covenant which God offers to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. Embedded in the covenant are the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:1–17) and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 20:22–23:19). The entire Book of Leviticus constitutes a second body of law, the Book of Numbers begins with yet another set, and the Book of Deuteronomy another. \n\nMoses has traditionally been regarded as the author of those four books and the Book of Genesis, which together comprise the Torah, the first and most revered section of the Hebrew Bible. \n\nHistoricity\n\nThe scholarly consensus is that the figure of Moses is legendary, and not historical,William G. Dever 'What Remains of the House That Albright Built?,' in George Ernest Wright, Frank Moore Cross, Edward Fay Campbell, Floyd Vivian Filson (eds.) The Biblical Archaeologist, American Schools of Oriental Research, Scholars Press, Vol. 56, No 1, 2 March 1993 pp.25-35,  p.33: 'the overwhelming scholarly consensus today is that Moses is a mythical figure.' although a \"Moses-like figure may have existed somewhere in the southern Transjordan in the mid-late 13th century B.C.\" Certainly no Egyptian sources mention Moses or the events of Exodus-Deuteronomy, nor has any archaeological evidence been discovered in Egypt or the Sinai wilderness to support the story in which he is the central figure. The story of his discovery picks up a familiar motif in ancient Near Eastern mythological accounts of the ruler who rises from humble origins: Thus Sargon of Akkad's Akkadian account of his origins runs;\nMy mother, the high priestess, conceived; in secret she bore me\nShe set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid\nShe cast me into the river which rose over me.Timothy D.

The lepers are bundled into Avaris, the former capital of the Hyksos, where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years – Osarseph then assumes the name Moses - and are then driven out.Jan Assmann, [https://books.google.it/books?idIjUiie30Z9cC&pg\nPA33 Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism,] Harvard University Press, 2009 pp.31-34.\n\nMoses in Hellenistic literature\n\nNon-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, from 323 BCE to about 146 BCE. Shmuel notes that \"a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples.\"\n\nIn addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians Artapanus, Eupolemus, Josephus, and Philo, a few non-Jewish historians including Hecataeus of Abdera (quoted by Diodorus Siculus), Alexander Polyhistor, Manetho, Apion, Chaeremon of Alexandria, Tacitus and Porphyry also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown. Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the Mishnah (c. 200 CE), Midrash (200–1200 CE),. and the Quran (c. 610–53).\n\nThe figure of Osarseph in Hellenistic historiography is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.\n\nIn Hecataeus\n\nThe earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of Hecataeus of Abdera (4th century BCE). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by Diodorus Siculus, wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, \"he describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized Judaea.\"  Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:\n\nDroge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by Eupolemus.\n\nIn Artapanus\n\nThe Jewish historian Artapanus of Alexandria (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus \"clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people.\"Barclay, John M. G. Jews in the Mediterranean Diaspora: From Alexander to Trajan (323 BCE – 117 CE), University of California Press (1996) p. 130\n\nArtapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of YHWH in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian temples of Isis thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses' miracles. He describes Moses as 80 years old, \"tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified.\"\n\nSome historians, however, point out the \"apologetic nature of much of Artapanus' work,\" with his addition of extra-biblical details, such as his references to Jethro: the non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses' gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.\n\nIn Strabo\n\nStrabo, a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his Geographica (c. 24 CE), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything – land and sea:\n\nIn Strabo's writings of the history of Judaism as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where \"the Temple of Jerusalem continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.\"  Strabo's \"positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses' personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature.\" His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of Hecataeus who \"described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage.\"\n\nEgyptologist Jan Assmann concludes that Strabo was the historian \"who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as monotheistic and as a pronounced counter-religion.\" It recognized \"only one divine being whom no image can represent... [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice.\"\n\nIn Tacitus\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56–120 CE) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes Jewish philosophy, is his Histories (c. 100), where, according to Arthur Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, \"pagan mythology fell into contempt.\"Tacitus, Cornelius. The works of Cornelius Tacitus: With an essay on his life and genius by Arthur Murphy, Thomas Wardle Publ. (1842) p. 499 Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh Bocchoris, suffering from a plague, banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god Zeus-Amun.\n\nIn this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the Holy Land on the seventh.Tacitus, Cornelius. Tacitus, The Histories, Volume 2, Book V. Chapters 5, 6 p. 208.\n\nIn Longinus\n\nThe Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, influenced Longinus, who may have been the author of the great book of literary criticism, On the Sublime.

Aside from a reference to Cicero, Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, contextually he is put on a par with Homer,. and he is described \"with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as Hecataeus and Strabo.\n\nIn Josephus\n\nIn Josephus' (37 – c. 100 CE) Antiquities of the Jews,  Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple, at the time the Ark of the Covenant was first moved into the newly built temple:\n\nAccording to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses' possession of the \"cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.\" He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he \"stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like Plato's philosopher-king, Moses excels as an educator.\"\n\nIn Numenius\n\nNumenius, a Greek philosopher who was a native of Apamea, in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that \"Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of Jesus...\"  He describes his background:\n\nIn Justin Martyr\n\nThe Christian saint and religious philosopher Justin Martyr (103–165 CE) drew the same conclusion as Numenius, according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be \"more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is older than the Greek philosophers.\"  He quotes him:\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism\n\nMost of what is known about Moses from the Bible comes from the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the Persian period, 538–332 BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions.Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, p.68Jean-Louis Ska, [https://books.google.com./books?id7g4yqsv0S0cC&pg\nPA260The Exegesis of the Pentateuch: Exegetical Studies and Basic Questions,] Forschungen zum Alten Testament, Vol 66, Mohr Siebeck, 2009 p.260. There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the Jewish apocrypha and in the genre of rabbinical exegesis known as Midrash, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The Midrash identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names.Midrash Rabbah, Ki Thissa, XL. 3-3, Lehrman, p. 463 Moses' other names were: Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by his father), Jered (by Miriam), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), Avi Gedor (by Kohath), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel).Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot 166 to Chronicles I 4:18, 24:6; also see Vayikra Rabbah 1:3; Chasidah p.345 Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman,Rashi to Bava Batra 15s, Chasidah p. 345 Mechoqeiq (lawgiver)Bava Batra 15a on Deuteronomy 33:21, Chasidah p. 345 and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3).Rashi to Berachot 54a, Chasidah p. 345 In another exegesis, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the seventh, even visited Paradise and Hell alive, after he saw the Divine vision in Mount Horeb.Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

Artapanus of Alexandria explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/Hermes, but also with the Greek figure Musaeus (whom he called \"the teacher of Orpheus\"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.Eusebius, l.c. ix. 27\n\nTo Orthodox Jews, Moses is called Moshe Rabbenu, `Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya\"a: \"Our Leader Moshe, Servant of God, Father of all the Prophets (may his merit shield us, amen)\".Honorifics for the dead in Judaism. In the orthodox view, Moses received not only the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the `hokhmat nistar teachings, which gave Judaism the Zohar of the Rashbi, the Torah of the Ari haQadosh and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the Ramhal and his masters). He is also considered the greatest prophet.Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

For Christians, Moses is often a symbol of God's law, as reinforced and expounded on in the teachings of Jesus. New Testament writers often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In Acts 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshipped the golden calf is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.\n\nMoses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the Pharisee Nicodemus at night in the third chapter of the Gospel of John, he compared Moses' lifting up of the bronze serpent in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and resurrection) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them manna in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the \"bread of life\", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people. \n\nMoses, along with Elijah, is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three Gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Matthew 17, Mark 9, and Luke 9, respectively. Jesus refers to the scribes and the Pharisees of the Temple as \"seated in the chair of Moses\" (, epi tēs Mōuseōs kathedras) \n \n\nHis relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a saint by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective Calendars of Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Lutheran churches on September 4. In Eastern Orthodox liturgics for September 4, Moses is commemorated as the \"Holy Prophet and God-seer Moses, on Mount Nebo\".Great Synaxaristes:  [http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/552/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Προφήτης Μωϋσῆς]. 4 Σεπτεμβρίου.

St John's Orthodox Church, Colchester, Essex, England.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates him as one of the Holy Forefathers in their Calendar of Saints on July 30.\n\nMormonism\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (colloquially called Mormons) generally view Moses in the same way that other Christians do. However, in addition to accepting the biblical account of Moses, Mormons include Selections from the Book of Moses as part of their scriptural canon. This book is believed to be the translated writings of Moses, and is included in the Pearl of Great Price.\n\nLatter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death (translated). In addition, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the Kirtland Temple (located in Kirtland, Ohio) in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the \"keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.\"The Doctrine and Covenants [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/11#11 110:11]\n\nIslam\n\nMoses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other Islamic prophet.  In general, Moses is described in ways which parallel the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and \"his character exhibits some of the main themes of Islamic theology,\" including the \"moral injunction that we are to submit ourselves to God.\" \n\nMoses is defined in the Quran as both prophet (nabi) and messenger (rasul), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people. \n\nHuston Smith describes an account in the Quran of meetings in heaven between Moses and Muhammad, which Huston states were \"one of the crucial events in Muhammad's life,\" and resulted in Muslims observing 5 daily prayers..\n\nMoses is mentioned 502 times in the Quran; passages mentioning Moses include 2.49–61, 7.103–160, 10.75–93, 17.101–104, 20.9–97, 26.10–66, 27.7–14, 28.3–46, 40.23–30, 43.46–55, 44.17–31, and 79.15–25. and many others. Most of the key events in Moses' life which are narrated in the Bible are to be found dispersed through the different Surahs of the Quran, with a story about meeting Khidr which is not found in the Bible.\n\nIn the Moses story related by the Quran, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection. The Pharaoh's wife Asiya, not his daughter, found Moses floating in the waters of the Nile. She convinced the Pharaoh to keep him as their son because they were not blessed with any children. \n\nThe Quran's account has emphasized Moses' mission to invite the Pharaoh to accept God's divine message as well as give salvation to the Israelites. According to the Quran, Moses encourages the Israelites to enter Canaan, but they are unwilling to fight the Canaanites, fearing certain defeat. Moses responds by pleading to Allah that he and his brother Aaron be separated from the rebellious Israelites. After which the Israelites are made to wander for 40 years.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho. \n\nBaha'i Faith\n\nMoses is one of the most important of God's messengers in the Bahá'í Faith being designated a Manifestation of God.. An epithet of Moses in Baha'i scriptures is the One Who Conversed with God.\n\nImportant figures in the Baha’i religion, such as Abdul’l-Baha, have highlighted the fact that Moses, like Abraham, had none of the makings of a great man of history, but through God's assistance he was able achieve many great things. He is described as having been \"for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness,\" of having had a stammer, and of being \"much hated and detested\" by the Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians of his time. He is said to have been raised in an oppressive household, and to have been known, in Egypt, as a man who had committed murder – though he had done so in order to prevent an act of cruelty.\n\nNevertheless, like Abraham, through the assistance of God, he achieved great things and gained renown even beyond the Levant. Chief among these achievements was the freeing of his people, the Hebrews, from bondage in Egypt and leading \"them to the Holy Land.\" He is viewed as the one who bestowed on Israel 'the religious and the civil law' which gave them \"honour among all nations,\" and which spread their fame to different parts of the world.\n\nFurthermore, through the law, Moses is believed to have led the Hebrews 'to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period.’ Abdul’l-Baha asserts that the ancient Greek philosophers regarded \"the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection.\" Chief among these philosophers, he says, was Socrates who \"visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.\"\n\nMoses is further described as paving the way for Bahá'u'lláh and his ultimate revelation, and as a teacher of truth, whose teachings were in line with the customs of his time..\n\nLegacy\n\nPolitics and law\n\nIn a metaphorical sense in the Christian tradition, a \"Moses\" has been referred to as the leader who delivers the people from a terrible situation. Among the Presidents of the United States known to have used the symbolism of Moses were Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who referred to his supporters as \"the Moses generation.\".\n\nIn subsequent years, theologians linked the Ten Commandments with the formation of early democracy. Scottish theologian William Barclay described them as \"the universal foundation of all things… the law without which nationhood is impossible.  …Our society is founded upon it.. Pope Francis addressed the United States Congress in 2015 stating that all people need to \"keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation... [and] the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being.[https://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9391549/pope-remarks-full-text \"Pope Francis addresses Congress\"], Vox, Sept. 24, 2015\n\nAmerican history\n\nPilgrims\n\nReferences to Moses were used by the Puritans, who relied on the story of Moses to give meaning and hope to the lives of Pilgrims seeking religious and personal freedom in America. John Carver was the first governor of Plymouth colony and first signer of the Mayflower Compact, which he wrote in 1620 during the ship Mayflowers three-month voyage. He inspired the Pilgrims with a \"sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose,\" notes historian Jon Meacham, and was called the \"Moses of the Pilgrims.\". Early American writer James Russell Lowell noted the similarity of the founding of America by the Pilgrims to that of ancient Israel by Moses:\n\nFollowing Carver's death the following year, William Bradford was made governor. He feared that the remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: \"Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?\". William G. Dever explains the attitude of the Pilgrims: \"We considered ourselves the 'New Israel,' particularly we in America. And for that reason we knew who we were, what we believed in and valued, and what our 'manifest destiny' was.\".\n\nFounding Fathers of the United States\n\nOn July 4, 1776, immediately after the Declaration of Independence was officially passed, the Continental Congress asked John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to design a seal that would clearly represent a symbol for the new United States.  They chose the symbol of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom.  The Founding Fathers of the United States inscribed the words of Moses on the Liberty Bell: \"Proclaim Liberty thro' all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof.\" (Leviticus 25)\n\nUpon the death of George Washington in 1799, two thirds of his eulogies referred to him as \"America's Moses,\" with one orator saying that \"Washington has been the same to us as Moses was to the Children of Israel.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin, in 1788, saw the difficulties that some of the newly independent American states were having in forming a government, and proposed that until a new code of laws could be agreed to, they should be governed by \"the laws of Moses,\" as contained in the Old Testament..  He justified his proposal by explaining that the laws had worked in biblical times: \"The Supreme Being… having rescued them from bondage by many miracles, performed by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that chosen servant, in the presence of the whole nation, a constitution and code of laws for their observance.\n\nJohn Adams, 2nd President of the United States, stated why he relied on the laws of Moses over Greek philosophy for establishing the United States Constitution: \"As much as I love, esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers.  Swedish historian Hugo Valentin credited Moses as the \"first to proclaim the rights of man.\".\n\nSlavery and civil rights\n\nHistorian Gladys L. Knight describes how leaders who emerged during slavery time and after often personified the Moses symbol. \"The symbol of Moses was empowering in that it served to amplify a need for freedom.\"Knight, Gladys L. Icons of African American Protest Vol I, Greenwood (2009) p. 183 Therefore, when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 after freeing the slaves, Black Americans said they had lost \"their Moses\". Lincoln biographer Charles Carleton Coffin writes, \"The millions whom Abraham Lincoln delivered from slavery will ever liken him to Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\". Similarly, Harriet Tubman, who rescued approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, was also described as the \"Moses\" of her people..\n\nIn the 1960s, a leading figure in the civil rights movement was Martin Luther King Jr., who was called \"a modern Moses,\" and often referred to Moses in his speeches: \"The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom.\"\n\nIn popular culture\n\nLiterature\n\n*Thomas Mann's novella The Tables of the Law (1944) is a retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt, with Moses as its main character. \n\nIn Freud\n\nSigmund Freud, in his last book, Moses and Monotheism in 1939, postulated that Moses was an Egyptian nobleman who adhered to the monotheism of Akhenaten. Following a theory proposed by a contemporary biblical critic, Freud believed that Moses was murdered in the wilderness, producing a collective sense of patricidal guilt that has been at the heart of Judaism ever since. \"Judaism had been a religion of the father, Christianity became a religion of the son\", he wrote. The possible Egyptian origin of Moses and of his message has received significant scholarly attention..\n\nOpponents of this view observe that the religion of the Torah seems different from Atenism in everything except the central feature of devotion to a single god, although this has been countered by a variety of arguments, e.g. pointing out the similarities between the Hymn to Aten and Psalm 104. Freud's interpretation of the historical Moses is not well accepted among historians, and is considered pseudohistory by many.\n\nArt\n\nDepiction on U.S. government buildings\nMoses is depicted in several U.S. government buildings because of his legacy as a lawgiver. In the Library of Congress stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the Paul the Apostle. Moses is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in marble bas-reliefs in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in the United States Capitol. The plaque's overview states: \"Moses (c. 1350–1250 B.C.) Hebrew prophet and lawgiver; transformed a wandering people into a nation; received the Ten Commandments.\"[http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/relief-portrait-plaques-lawgivers/moses \"Moses relieve portrait\"], Architect of the Capitol\n\nThe other twenty-two figures have their profiles turned to Moses, which is the only forward-facing bas-relief..\n\nMoses appears eight times in carvings that ring the Supreme Court Great Hall ceiling. His face is presented along with other ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the Chief Justice of the United States' head. In the center of the 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden..\n\nMichelangelo's statue\nMichelangelo's statue of Moses in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome, is one of the most familiar masterpieces in the world. The horns the sculptor included on Moses' head are the result of a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible into the Latin Vulgate Bible with which Michelangelo was familiar. The Hebrew word taken from Exodus means either a \"horn\" or an \"irradiation.\" Experts at the Archaeological Institute of America show that the term was used when Moses \"returned to his people after seeing as much of the Glory of the Lord as human eye could stand,\" and his face \"reflected radiance.\"MacLean, Margaret. (ed) Art and Archaeology, Vol. VI, Archaeological Institute of America (1917) p. 97 In early Jewish art, moreover, Moses is often \"shown with rays coming out of his head.\"\n\nAnother author explains, \"When Saint Jerome translated the Old Testament into Latin, he thought no one but Christ should glow with rays of light — so he advanced the secondary translation. However, writer J. Stephen Lang points out that Jerome's version actually described Moses as \"giving off hornlike rays,\" and he \"rather clumsily translated it to mean 'having horns.'\" It has also been noted that he had Moses seated on a throne, yet Moses was never given the title of a King nor ever sat on such thrones.\n\nFilm and television\n*Moses was portrayed by Theodore Roberts in Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 silent film The Ten Commandments. Moses appeared as the central character in the 1956 DeMille movie, also called The Ten Commandments, in which he was portrayed by Charlton Heston. A television remake was produced in 2006.\n\n*Burt Lancaster played Moses in the 1975 television miniseries Moses the Lawgiver. \n\n*In the 1981 comedy film History of the World, Part I, Moses was portrayed by Mel Brooks.\n\n*Sir Ben Kingsley was the narrator of the 2007 animated film, The Ten Commandments.\n\n*Moses appeared as the central character in the 1998 DreamWorks Pictures' animated movie, The Prince of Egypt. He was voiced by Val Kilmer.\n\n*In the 2009 miniseries Battles BC, Moses was portrayed by Cazzey Louis Cereghino.\n\n*In the 2013 television miniseries The Bible, Moses was portrayed by actor William Houston.\n\n*Christian Bale portrayed Moses in Ridley Scott's 2014 film Exodus: Gods and Kings which portrayed Moses and Rameses II as being raised by Seti I as cousins. \n\n*Guilherme Winter portrayed Moses in Alexandre Avancini and Vivian De Oliveira 2015-2016 Brazilian miniseries Moisés y los diez mandamientos (original title: Os Dez Mandamentos).\n\nCriticism of Moses\n\nThomas Paine and Numbers 31:13-18\nIn the late eighteenth century, the deist Thomas Paine commented at length on Moses' Laws in The Age of Reason (1794, 1795, and 1807). Paine considered Moses to be a \"detestable villain\", and cited  as an example of his \"unexampled atrocities\".Paine, Thomas (1796) The Age of Reason, part II. In the passage, the Jewish army had returned from conquering the Midianites, and Moses has gone down to meet it:\n\nThe prominent atheist Richard Dawkins also made reference to these verses in his 2006 book, The God Delusion, concluding that Moses was \"not a great role model for modern moralists\".Dawkins, Richard (2006). The God Delusion Chapter 7. Bantam Press. \n\nHowever, some Jewish sources defend Moses' role. The Chasam Sofer emphasizes that this war was not fought at Moses' behest, but was commanded by God as an act of revenge against the Midianite women,. who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin. Rabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a \"powerful fable of lust and betrayal\", and that Moses' execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes.Grossman, Joel (2008), [http://libraryminyan.org/divreitorah/Jole%20Grossman%20-%20Matot.htm \"Matot\"] . Temple Beth Am Library Minyan. Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the Reform movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a cautionary tale, to \"warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior\".Levin, Alan J.
