  "textBody" : "A ketene is an organic compound of the form R′R″CC\nO. Ketene also refers to the specific compound CH2C\nO, the simplest ketene molecule, which is occasionally called ethenone. Although they are highly useful, most ketenes are unstable, so they are not usually isolated during a reaction process.Raimund Miller, Claudio Abaecherli, Adel Said, Barry Jackson \"Ketenes\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2001, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. \n\nPreparation\n\nKetenes were first studied as a class by Hermann Staudinger.\n\nKetene, the simplest ketene, is produced on a large scale industrially for use in the production of acetic anhydride.  It can also be generated by pyrolysis (thermal cracking) of acetone:\nCH3−CO−CH3  → CH2C\nO + CH4\nThis reaction is called the Schmidlin ketene synthesis.Ketene in Organic Syntheses Organic Syntheses, Submitted by C.
