In the Middle Ages the two were treated as Christian saints, being entered in the Greek Orthodox calendar on 26 August, and in the Roman Martyrology in the Western Church as \"Barlaam and Josaphat\" on the date of 27 November. In the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, these two are commemorated on 19 November  (corresponding to 2 December on the Gregorian calendar).[http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm November 19/December 2] .

OCA – Feasts and Saints.\n\nThe first Christianized adaptation was the Georgian epic Balavariani dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, Euthymius of Athos, translated the story into Greek, some time before he was killed while visiting Constantinople in 1028 . There the Greek adaptation was translated into Latin in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as Barlaam and Josaphat.William Cantwell Smith, \"Towards a World Theology\" (1981) The Greek legend of \"Barlaam and Ioasaph\" is sometimes attributed to the 7th century John of Damascus, but Conybeare argued it was transcribed by the Georgian monk Euthymius in the 11th century.F.C. Conybeare, \"The Barlaam and Josaphat Legend in the Ancient Georgian and Armenian Literatures\" (Gorgias Press)\n\nThe story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the Middle Ages, appearing in such works as the Golden Legend, and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via Caxton's English translation of a Latin version, in Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\".Sangharakshita, \"From Genesis to the Diamond Sutra – A Western Buddhist's Encounters with Christianity\" (Windhorse Publications, 2005), p.165\n\nTwo Middle High German versions were produced: one, the \"Laubacher Barlaam\", by Bishop Otto II of Freising and another, Barlaam und Josaphat, a romance in verse, by Rudolf von Ems. The latter was described as \"perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages\" by Heinrich Heine.Die Blüte der heiligen Dichtkunst im deutschen Mittelalter ist vielleicht »Barlaam und Josaphat«...  See Heinrich Heine, [http://www.heinrich-heine.net/schule/schuled1.htm Die romantische Schule (Erstes Buch)]  at heinrich-heine.net. .\n\nThe story of Josaphat was re-told as an exploration of free will and the seeking of inner peace through meditation in the 17th century.\n\nThe legend\n\nAccording to the legend, King Abenner or Avenier in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, founded by the Apostle Thomas. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father's anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.\n\nName\n\nIoasaph (Georgian Iodasaph, Arabic Yūdhasaf or Būdhasaf) is derived from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva.Kevin Trainor (ed), \"Buddhism\" (Duncan Baird Publishers, 2001), p. 24 The Sanskrit word was changed to Bodisav in Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to Budhasaf or Yudasaf in an 8th-century Arabic document (possibly Arabic initial \"b\" ﺑ changed to  \"y\" ﻳ by duplication of a dot in handwriting).Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 Page 202 \"Le nom de Josaphat dérive, tout comme son associé Barlaam dans la légende, du mot Bodhisattva.
