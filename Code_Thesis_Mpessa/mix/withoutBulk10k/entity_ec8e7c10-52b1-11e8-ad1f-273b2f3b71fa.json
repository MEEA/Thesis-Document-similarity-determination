  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are sought or studied (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values). A linear Diophantine equation is an equation that sums two monomials of degree zero or one.  An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns.\n\nDiophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an algebraic curve, algebraic surface, or more general object, and ask about the lattice points on it.\n\nThe word Diophantine refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.\n\nWhile individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations (beyond the theory of quadratic forms) was an achievement of the twentieth century.\n\nExamples\n\nIn the following Diophantine equations, , , , and  are the unknowns and the other letters are given constants:\n\nLinear Diophantine equations\n\nOne equation\n\nThe simplest linear Diophantine equation takes the form , where ,  and  are given integers. The solutions are  described by the following theorem:\nThis Diophantine equation has a solution (where  and  are integers) if and only if  is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of  and . Moreover, if  is a solution, then the other solutions have the form , where  is an arbitrary integer, and  and  are the quotients of  and  (respectively) by the greatest common divisor of  and .\n\nProof: If  is this greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity asserts the existence of integers  and  such that . If  is a multiple of , then  for some integer , and  is a solution. On the other hand, for every pair of integers  and , the greatest common divisor  of  and  divides . Thus, if the equation has a solution, then  must be a multiple of . If  and , then for every solution , we have\n,\nshowing that  is another solution. Finally, given two solutions such that , one deduces that . As  and  are coprime, Euclid's lemma shows that  divides , and thus that\nthere exists an integer  such that  and . Therefore,  and , which completes the proof.\n\nChinese remainder theorem\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem describes an important class of linear Diophantine systems of equations: let  be  pairwise coprime integers greater than one,  be  arbitrary integers, and  be the product . The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that the following linear Diophantine system has exactly one solution  such that , and that the other solutions are obtained by adding to  a multiple of :\n\\begin{align}\nx&= a_1 + n_1\\,x_1\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nx&=a_k+n_k\\,x_k\n\\end{align}\n\nSystem of linear Diophantine equations\n\nMore generally, every system of linear Diophantine equations may be solved by computing the Smith normal form of its matrix, in a way that is similar to the use of the reduced row echelon form to solve a system of linear equations over a field. Using matrix notation every system of linear Diophantine equations may be written\n,\nwhere  is an  matrix of integers,  is an  column matrix of unknowns and  is an  column matrix of integers.\n\nThe computation of the Smith normal form of  provides two unimodular matrices (that is matrices that are invertible over the integers and have ±1 as determinant)  and  of respective dimensions  and , such that the matrix\nis such that  is not zero for  not greater than some integer , and all the other entries are zero. The system to be solved may thus be rewritten as\n.\nCalling  the entries of  and  those of , this leads to the system\nfor ,\nfor .\nThis system is equivalent to the given one in the following sense: A column matrix of integers  is a solution of the given system if and only if  for some column matrix of integers  such that .\n\nIt follows that the system has a solution if and only if  divides  for  and  for .

However, Hermite normal form does not directly provide the solutions; to get the solutions from the Hermite normal form, one has to successively solve several linear equations. Nevertheless, Richard Zippel wrote that the Smith normal form \"is somewhat more than is actually needed to solve linear diophantine equations. Instead of reducing the equation to diagonal form, we only need to make it triangular, which is called the Hermite normal form. The Hermite normal form is substantially easier to compute than the Smith normal form.\"\n\nInteger linear programming amounts to finding some integer solutions (optimal in some sense) of linear systems that include also inequations.  Thus systems of linear Diophantine equations are basic in this context, and textbooks on integer programming usually have a treatment of systems of linear Diophantine equations.\n\nDiophantine analysis\n\nTypical questions \n\nThe questions asked in Diophantine analysis include:\n\n#Are there any solutions?\n#Are there any solutions beyond some that are easily found by inspection?\n#Are there finitely or infinitely many solutions?\n#Can all solutions be found in theory?\n#Can one in practice compute a full list of solutions?\n\nThese traditional problems often lay unsolved for centuries, and mathematicians gradually came to understand their depth (in some cases), rather than treat them as puzzles.\n\nTypical problem \n\nThe given information is that a father's age is 1 less than twice that of his son, and that the digits  making up the father's age are reversed in the son's age (i.e. ). This leads to the equation , thus . Inspection gives the result , , and thus  equals 73 years and  equals 37 years. One may easily show that there is not any other solution with  and  positive integers less than 10.\n\n17th and 18th centuries\n\nIn 1637, Pierre de Fermat scribbled on the margin of his copy of Arithmetica: \"It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second into two like powers.\" Stated in more modern language, \"The equation  has no solutions for any  higher than 2.\" And then he wrote, intriguingly: \"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this proposition, which this margin is too narrow to contain.\" Such a proof eluded mathematicians for centuries, however, and as such his statement became famous as Fermat's Last Theorem. It wasn't until 1995 that it was proven by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles.\n\nIn 1657, Fermat attempted to solve the Diophantine equation  (solved by Brahmagupta over 1000 years earlier). The equation was eventually solved by Euler in the early 18th century, who also solved a number of other Diophantine equations. The smallest solution of this equation in positive integers is ,  (see Chakravala method).\n\nHilbert's tenth problem\n\nIn 1900, David Hilbert proposed the solvability of all Diophantine equations as the tenth of his fundamental problems. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich solved it negatively, by proving that a general algorithm for solving all Diophantine equations cannot exist.\n\nDiophantine geometry\n\nDiophantine geometry, which is the application of techniques from algebraic geometry in this field, has continued to grow as a result; since treating arbitrary equations is a dead end, attention turns to equations that also have a geometric meaning. The central idea of Diophantine geometry is that of a rational point, namely a solution to a polynomial equation or a system of polynomial equations, which is a vector in a prescribed field , when  is not  algebraically closed.\n\nModern research\n\nOne of the few general approaches is through the Hasse principle. Infinite descent is the traditional method, and has been pushed a long way.\n\nThe depth of the study of general Diophantine equations is shown by the characterisation of Diophantine sets as equivalently described as recursively enumerable. In other words, the general problem of Diophantine analysis is blessed or cursed with universality, and in any case is not something that will be solved except by re-expressing it in other terms.\n\nThe field of Diophantine approximation deals with the cases of Diophantine inequalities. Here variables are still supposed to be integral, but some coefficients may be irrational numbers, and the equality sign is replaced by upper and lower bounds.\n\nThe most celebrated single question in the field, the conjecture known as Fermat's Last Theorem, was solved by Andrew Wiles[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html Solving Fermat: Andrew Wiles] but using tools from algebraic geometry developed during the last century rather than within number theory where the conjecture was originally formulated. Other major results, such as Faltings's theorem, have disposed of old conjectures.\n\nInfinite Diophantine equations\n\nAn example of an infinite diophantine equation is:\n,\nwhich can be expressed as \"How many ways can a given integer  be written as the sum of a square plus twice a square plus thrice a square and so on?\" The number of ways this can be done for each  forms an integer sequence. Infinite Diophantine equations are related to theta functions and infinite dimensional lattices. This equation always has a solution for any positive . Compare this to:\n,\nwhich does not always have a solution for positive .\n\nExponential Diophantine equations\n\nIf a Diophantine equation has as an additional variable or variables occurring as exponents, it is an exponential Diophantine equation. Examples include the Ramanujan–Nagell equation, , and the equation of the Fermat-Catalan conjecture and Beal's conjecture,  with inequality restrictions on the exponents. A general theory for such equations is not available; particular cases such as Catalan's conjecture have been tackled. However, the majority are solved via ad hoc methods such as Størmer's theorem or even trial and error.",
