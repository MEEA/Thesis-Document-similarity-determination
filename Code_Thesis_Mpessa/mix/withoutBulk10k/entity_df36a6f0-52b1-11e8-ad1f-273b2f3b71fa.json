  "textBody" : "The Cauchy distribution, named after Augustin Cauchy, is a continuous probability distribution.  It is also known, especially among physicists, as the Lorentz distribution (after Hendrik Lorentz), Cauchy–Lorentz distribution, Lorentz(ian) function, or Breit–Wigner distribution.  The Cauchy distribution f(x; x_0,\\gamma) is the distribution of the x-intercept of a ray issuing from (x_0,\\gamma) with a uniformly distributed angle.  It is also the distribution of the ratio of two independent  normally distributed random variables if the denominator distribution has mean zero.\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a \"pathological\" distribution since both its expected value and its variance are undefined. (But see the section Explanation of undefined moments below.) The Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of order greater than or equal to one; only fractional absolute moments exist., Chapter 16. The Cauchy distribution has no moment generating function.\n\nIn mathematics, it is closely related to the Poisson kernel, which is the fundamental solution for the Laplace equation in the upper half-plane.  In spectroscopy, it is the description of the shape of spectral lines which are subject to homogeneous broadening in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably collision broadening.\n\nIt is one of the few distributions that is stable and has a probability density function that can be expressed analytically, the others being the normal distribution and the Lévy distribution.\n\nHistory\n\nFunctions with the form of the Cauchy distribution were studied by mathematicians in the 17th century, but in a different context and under the title of the Witch of Agnesi. Despite its name, the first explicit analysis of the properties of the Cauchy distribution was published by the French mathematician Poisson in 1824, with Cauchy only becoming associated with it during an academic controversy in 1853.Cauchy and the Witch of Agnesi in Statistics on the Table, S M Stigler Harvard 1999 Chapter 18 As such, the name of the distribution is a case of Stigler's Law of Eponymy. Poisson noted that if the mean of observations following such a distribution were taken, the mean error did not converge to any finite number. As such, Laplace's use of the Central Limit Theorem with such a distribution was inappropriate, as it assumed a finite mean and variance. Despite this, Poisson did not regard the issue as important, in contrast to Bienaymé, who was to engage Cauchy in a long dispute over the matter.\n\nCharacterisation\n\nProbability density function\n\nThe Cauchy distribution has the probability density function (PDF)\nf(x; x_0,\\gamma) \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x - x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right]} \n { 1 \\over \\pi \\gamma } \\left[ { \\gamma^2 \\over (x - x_0)^2 + \\gamma^2  } \\right], \n\nwhere x_0 is the location parameter, specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and \\gamma is the scale parameter which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), alternatively 2\\gamma is full width at half maximum (FWHM). \\gamma is also equal to half the interquartile range and is sometimes called the probable error. Augustin-Louis Cauchy exploited such a density function in 1827 with an infinitesimal scale parameter, defining what would now be called a Dirac delta function.\n\nThe maximum value or amplitude of the Cauchy PDF is \\frac{1}{\\pi \\gamma}, located at x=x_0.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to express the PDF  in terms of the complex parameter \\psi= x_0 + i\\gamma\n\nf(x;\\psi)\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\,\\textrm{Im}\\left(\\frac{1}{x-\\psi}\\right)\n\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\,\\textrm{Re}\\left(\\frac{-i}{x-\\psi}\\right)\n\nThe special case when x_0 0 and \\gamma \n 1 is called the standard Cauchy distribution with the probability density function\n f(x; 0,1) = \\frac{1}{\\pi (1 + x^2)}. \\!\n\nIn physics, a three-parameter Lorentzian function is often used:\nf(x; x_0,\\gamma,I) \\frac{I}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right]} \n I \\left[ { \\gamma^2 \\over (x - x_0)^2 + \\gamma^2  } \\right], \nwhere I is the height of the peak. The three-parameter Lorentzian function indicated is not, in general, a probability density function, since it does not integrate to 1, except in the special case where  I = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma}.\\!\n\nCumulative distribution function\n\nThe cumulative distribution function is:\nF(x; x_0,\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\n\nand the quantile function (inverse cdf) of the Cauchy distribution is\nQ(p; x_0,\\gamma) = x_0 + \\gamma\\,\\tan\\left[\\pi\\left(p-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right].\nIt follows that the first and third quartiles are (x_0 - \\gamma, x_0 + \\gamma), and hence the interquartile range is 2\\gamma.\n\nFor the standard distribution, the cumulative distribution function simplifies to arctangent function \\arctan(x):\nF(x; 0,1)=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(x\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\n\nEntropy \n\nThe entropy of the Cauchy distribution is given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\nH(\\gamma) & =-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;x_0,\\gamma) \\log(f(x;x_0,\\gamma)) \\, dx \\\\[6pt]\n& =\\log(4\\pi\\gamma)\n\\end{align}\n\nThe derivative of the quantile function, the quantile density function, for the Cauchy distribution is:\n\nQ'(p; \\gamma) = \\gamma\\,\\pi\\,{\\sec}^2\\left[\\pi\\left(p-\\tfrac 1 2 \\right)\\right].\\!\n\nThe differential entropy of a distribution can be defined in terms of its quantile density, specifically:\n\nH(\\gamma) \\int_0^1 \\log\\,(Q'(p; \\gamma))\\,\\mathrm dp \n \\log(4\\pi\\gamma)\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}[\\log(1+(X-x_0)^2/\\gamma^2)]=\\log 4\n\nor, alternatively, for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}[\\log(1+(X-x_0)^2)]=2\\log(1+\\gamma).\n\nIn its standard form, it is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}\\!\\left[\\ln(1+X^2) \\right]=\\ln 4.\n\nProperties\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution which has no mean, variance or higher moments defined. Its mode and median are well defined and are both equal to x_0.\n\nWhen U and V are two independent normally distributed random variables with expected value 0 and variance 1, then the ratio U/V has the standard Cauchy distribution.\n\nIf \\Sigma is a p\\times p positive-semidefinite covariance matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries, then for independent and identically distributed X,Y\\sim N(0,\\Sigma) and any random p-vector w independent of X and Y such that w_1+\\cdots+w_p1 and w_i\\geq 0, i\n1,\\cdots,p, it holds that\n\n\\sum_{j1}^p w_j\\frac{X_j}{Y_j}\\sim\\mathrm{Cauchy}(0,1).\n\nIf X_1, ..., X_n are independent and identically distributed random variables, each with a standard Cauchy distribution, then the sample mean (X_1 + ... + X_n)/n has the same standard Cauchy distribution. To see that this is true, compute the characteristic function of the sample mean:\n\\phi_{\\overline{X}}(t) = \\mathrm{E}\\left[e^{i\\overline{X}t}\\right]\n\nwhere \\overline{X} is the sample mean. This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the central limit theorem cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all stable distributions, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is an infinitely divisible probability distribution. It is also a strictly stable distribution.\n\nThe standard Cauchy distribution coincides with the Student's t-distribution with one degree of freedom.\n\nLike all stable distributions, the location-scale family to which the Cauchy distribution belongs is closed under linear transformations with real coefficients. In addition, the Cauchy distribution is closed under linear fractional transformations with real coefficients. In this connection, see also McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions.\n\nCharacteristic function\n\nLet X denote a Cauchy distributed random variable. The characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution is given by\n\n\\phi_X(t; x_0,\\gamma) \\mathrm{E}\\left[e^{iXt} \\right ] \n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;x_{0},\\gamma)e^{ixt}\\,dx =  e^{ix_0t - \\gamma |t|}.\n\nwhich is just the Fourier transform of the probability density. The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(x; x_0,\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi_X(t;x_0,\\gamma)e^{-ixt}\\,dt \\!\n\nThe nth moment of a distribution is the nth derivative of the characteristic function evaluated at t=0. Observe that the characteristic function is not differentiable at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have well-defined moments higher than the zeroth moment.\n\nExplanation of undefined moments\n\nMean\n\nIf a probability distribution has a density function f(x), then the mean is\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx. \\qquad\\qquad (1)\\!\n\nThe question is now whether this is the same thing as\n\\int_a^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx+\\int_{-\\infty}^a x f(x)\\,dx.\\qquad\\qquad (2) \\!\nfor an arbitrary real number a.\n\nIf at most one of the two terms in (2) is infinite, then (1) is the same as (2). But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the positive and negative terms of (2) are infinite. Hence (1) is undefined.\n\nNote that the  Cauchy principal value of the Cauchy distribution is:\n\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!\n\nwhich is zero, while:\n\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!\n\nis not zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral.\n\nVarious results in probability theory about expected values, such as the strong law of large numbers, will not work in such cases.\n\nHigher moments\n\nThe Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of any order.  Some of the higher raw moments do exist and have a value of infinity, for example the raw second moment:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{E}[X^2] & \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 1 - \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx \\\\[8pt]\n& \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx \n \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx-\\pi = \\infty.\n\\end{align}\n\nBy re-arranging the formula, one can see that the second moment is essentially the infinite integral of a constant (here 1).  Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity.  Odd-powered raw moments, however, are undefined, which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to \\infty - \\infty since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs.  The first raw moment is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the central moments and standardized moments are undefined, since they are all based on the mean.  The variance—which is the second central moment—is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).\n\nThe results for higher moments follow from Hölder's inequality, which implies that higher moments (or halves of moments) diverge if lower ones do.\n\nEstimation of parameters \n\nBecause the parameters of the Cauchy distribution do not correspond to a mean and variance, attempting to estimate the parameters of the Cauchy distribution by using a sample mean and a sample variance will not succeed.[http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/ee_distri_cauchy.html Illustration of instability of sample means] For example, if an i.i.d. sample of size n is taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:\n\n\\bar{x}\\frac 1 n \\sum_{i\n1}^n x_i\n\nAlthough the sample values x_i will be concentrated about the central value x_0, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more observations are taken, because of the increased probability of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the observations themselves; i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of x_0 than any single observation from the sample. Similarly, calculating the sample variance will result in values that grow larger as more observations are taken.\n\nTherefore, more robust means of estimating the central value x_0 and the scaling parameter \\gamma are needed. One simple method is to take the median value of the sample as an estimator of x_0 and half the sample interquartile range as an estimator of \\gamma. Other, more precise and robust methods have been developed   For example, the truncated mean of the middle 24% of the sample order statistics produces an estimate for x_0 that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean. However, because of the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases if more than 24% of the sample is used.\n\nMaximum likelihood can also be used to estimate the parameters x_0 and \\gamma. However, this tends to be complicated by the fact that this requires finding the roots of a high degree polynomial, and there can be multiple roots that represent local maxima. Also, while the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient, it is relatively inefficient for small samples.  The log-likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution for sample size n is:\n\n\\hat\\ell(\\!x_0,\\gamma\\mid x_1,\\dotsc,x_n) - n \\log (\\gamma \\pi) - \\sum_{i\n1}^n \\log \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x_i - x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right)\n\nMaximizing the log likelihood function with respect to x_0 and \\gamma produces the following system of equations:\n\n \\sum_{i1}^n \\frac{x_i - x_0}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - \\!x_0]^2} \n 0\n \\sum_{i1}^n \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} - \\frac{n}{2} \n 0\n\nNote that\n\n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} \n\nis a monotone function in \\gamma and that the solution \\gamma must satisfy\n\n \\min |x_i-x_0|\\le \\gamma\\le \\max |x_i-x_0|. \n\nSolving just for x_0 requires solving a polynomial of degree 2n-1, and solving just for \\gamma requires solving a polynomial of degree n (first for \\gamma^2, then x_0). Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both parameters simultaneously, a numerical solution on a computer is typically required. The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating x_0 using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating x_0 by maximum likelihood. The truncated sample mean using the middle 24% order statistics is about 88% as asymptotically efficient an estimator of x_0 as the maximum likelihood estimate. When Newton's method is used to find the solution for the maximum likelihood estimate, the middle 24% order statistics can be used as an initial solution for x_0.\n\nMultivariate Cauchy distribution\n\nA random vector X(X_1, \\ldots, X_k)' is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components Y\na_1X_1+ \\cdots + a_kX_k has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector a\\in \\mathbb R^k, the random variable Ya'X should have a univariate Cauchy distribution.  The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:\n\n\\varphi_X(t) =  e^{ix_0(t)-\\gamma(t)}, \\!\n\nwhere x_0(t) and \\gamma(t) are real functions with x_0(t) a homogeneous function of degree one and \\gamma(t) a positive homogeneous function of degree one.  More formally:\n\nx_0(at) = ax_0(t),\n\\gamma (at) = |a|\\gamma (t),\n\nfor all t.\n\nAn example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:\nf(x, y; x_0,y_0,\\gamma)= { 1 \\over 2 \\pi } \\left[ { \\gamma \\over ((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 +\\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \\right] .\nNote that in this example, even though there is no analogue to a covariance matrix, x and y are not statistically independent.\n\nAnalogous to the univariate density, the multidimensional Cauchy density also relates to the multivariate Student distribution. They are equivalent when the degrees of freedom parameter is equal to one. The density of a k dimension Student distribution with one degree of freedom becomes:\n\nf({\\mathbf x}; {\\mathbf\\mu},{\\mathbf\\Sigma}, k)= \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1+k}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2})\\pi^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\left|{\\mathbf\\Sigma}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[1+({\\mathbf x}-{\\mathbf\\mu})^T{\\mathbf\\Sigma}^{-1}({\\mathbf x}-{\\mathbf\\mu})\\right]^{\\frac{1+k}{2}}} .\n\nProperties and details for this density can be obtained by taking it as a particular case of the multivariate Student density.\n\nTransformation properties\n\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0,\\gamma)\\, then  kX+l \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0{k}+l,\\gamma |k|)\\,\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0,\\gamma_0)\\, and Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_1,\\gamma_1)\\, are independent, then  X+Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0+x_1,\\gamma_0+\\gamma_1)\\, and  X-Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0-x_1,|\\gamma_0-\\gamma_1|)\\,\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(0,\\gamma)\\, then  \\tfrac{1}{X} \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(0,\\tfrac{1}{\\gamma})\\,\n*McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions:McCullagh, P., [http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/2/247 \"Conditional inference and Cauchy models\"], Biometrika, volume 79 (1992), pages 247–259.

The three-parameter Lorentzian function indicated is not, in general, a probability density function, since it does not integrate to 1, except in the special case where  I = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma}.\\!\n\nCumulative distribution function\n\nThe cumulative distribution function is:\nF(x; x_0,\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\n\nand the quantile function (inverse cdf) of the Cauchy distribution is\nQ(p; x_0,\\gamma) = x_0 + \\gamma\\,\\tan\\left[\\pi\\left(p-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right].\nIt follows that the first and third quartiles are (x_0 - \\gamma, x_0 + \\gamma), and hence the interquartile range is 2\\gamma.\n\nFor the standard distribution, the cumulative distribution function simplifies to arctangent function \\arctan(x):\nF(x; 0,1)=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(x\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\n\nEntropy \n\nThe entropy of the Cauchy distribution is given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\nH(\\gamma) & =-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;x_0,\\gamma) \\log(f(x;x_0,\\gamma)) \\, dx \\\\[6pt]\n& =\\log(4\\pi\\gamma)\n\\end{align}\n\nThe derivative of the quantile function, the quantile density function, for the Cauchy distribution is:\n\nQ'(p; \\gamma) = \\gamma\\,\\pi\\,{\\sec}^2\\left[\\pi\\left(p-\\tfrac 1 2 \\right)\\right].\\!\n\nThe differential entropy of a distribution can be defined in terms of its quantile density, specifically:\n\nH(\\gamma) \\int_0^1 \\log\\,(Q'(p; \\gamma))\\,\\mathrm dp \n \\log(4\\pi\\gamma)\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}[\\log(1+(X-x_0)^2/\\gamma^2)]=\\log 4\n\nor, alternatively, for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}[\\log(1+(X-x_0)^2)]=2\\log(1+\\gamma).\n\nIn its standard form, it is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X for which \n\n\\operatorname{E}\\!\\left[\\ln(1+X^2) \\right]=\\ln 4.\n\nProperties\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution which has no mean, variance or higher moments defined. Its mode and median are well defined and are both equal to x_0.\n\nWhen U and V are two independent normally distributed random variables with expected value 0 and variance 1, then the ratio U/V has the standard Cauchy distribution.\n\nIf \\Sigma is a p\\times p positive-semidefinite covariance matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries, then for independent and identically distributed X,Y\\sim N(0,\\Sigma) and any random p-vector w independent of X and Y such that w_1+\\cdots+w_p1 and w_i\\geq 0, i\n1,\\cdots,p, it holds that\n\n\\sum_{j1}^p w_j\\frac{X_j}{Y_j}\\sim\\mathrm{Cauchy}(0,1).\n\nIf X_1, ..., X_n are independent and identically distributed random variables, each with a standard Cauchy distribution, then the sample mean (X_1 + ... + X_n)/n has the same standard Cauchy distribution. To see that this is true, compute the characteristic function of the sample mean:\n\\phi_{\\overline{X}}(t) = \\mathrm{E}\\left[e^{i\\overline{X}t}\\right]\n\nwhere \\overline{X} is the sample mean. This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the central limit theorem cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all stable distributions, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is an infinitely divisible probability distribution. It is also a strictly stable distribution.\n\nThe standard Cauchy distribution coincides with the Student's t-distribution with one degree of freedom.\n\nLike all stable distributions, the location-scale family to which the Cauchy distribution belongs is closed under linear transformations with real coefficients. In addition, the Cauchy distribution is closed under linear fractional transformations with real coefficients. In this connection, see also McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions.\n\nCharacteristic function\n\nLet X denote a Cauchy distributed random variable. The characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution is given by\n\n\\phi_X(t; x_0,\\gamma) \\mathrm{E}\\left[e^{iXt} \\right ] \n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;x_{0},\\gamma)e^{ixt}\\,dx =  e^{ix_0t - \\gamma |t|}.\n\nwhich is just the Fourier transform of the probability density. The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(x; x_0,\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi_X(t;x_0,\\gamma)e^{-ixt}\\,dt \\!\n\nThe nth moment of a distribution is the nth derivative of the characteristic function evaluated at t=0. Observe that the characteristic function is not differentiable at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have well-defined moments higher than the zeroth moment.\n\nExplanation of undefined moments\n\nMean\n\nIf a probability distribution has a density function f(x), then the mean is\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx. \\qquad\\qquad (1)\\!\n\nThe question is now whether this is the same thing as\n\\int_a^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx+\\int_{-\\infty}^a x f(x)\\,dx.\\qquad\\qquad (2) \\!\nfor an arbitrary real number a.\n\nIf at most one of the two terms in (2) is infinite, then (1) is the same as (2). But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the positive and negative terms of (2) are infinite. Hence (1) is undefined.\n\nNote that the  Cauchy principal value of the Cauchy distribution is:\n\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!\n\nwhich is zero, while:\n\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!\n\nis not zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral.\n\nVarious results in probability theory about expected values, such as the strong law of large numbers, will not work in such cases.\n\nHigher moments\n\nThe Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of any order.  Some of the higher raw moments do exist and have a value of infinity, for example the raw second moment:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{E}[X^2] & \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 1 - \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx \\\\[8pt]\n& \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx \n \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx-\\pi = \\infty.\n\\end{align}\n\nBy re-arranging the formula, one can see that the second moment is essentially the infinite integral of a constant (here 1).  Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity.  Odd-powered raw moments, however, are undefined, which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to \\infty - \\infty since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs.  The first raw moment is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the central moments and standardized moments are undefined, since they are all based on the mean.  The variance—which is the second central moment—is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).\n\nThe results for higher moments follow from Hölder's inequality, which implies that higher moments (or halves of moments) diverge if lower ones do.\n\nEstimation of parameters \n\nBecause the parameters of the Cauchy distribution do not correspond to a mean and variance, attempting to estimate the parameters of the Cauchy distribution by using a sample mean and a sample variance will not succeed.[http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/ee_distri_cauchy.html Illustration of instability of sample means] For example, if an i.i.d. sample of size n is taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:\n\n\\bar{x}\\frac 1 n \\sum_{i\n1}^n x_i\n\nAlthough the sample values x_i will be concentrated about the central value x_0, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more observations are taken, because of the increased probability of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the observations themselves; i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of x_0 than any single observation from the sample. Similarly, calculating the sample variance will result in values that grow larger as more observations are taken.\n\nTherefore, more robust means of estimating the central value x_0 and the scaling parameter \\gamma are needed. One simple method is to take the median value of the sample as an estimator of x_0 and half the sample interquartile range as an estimator of \\gamma. Other, more precise and robust methods have been developed   For example, the truncated mean of the middle 24% of the sample order statistics produces an estimate for x_0 that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean. However, because of the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases if more than 24% of the sample is used.\n\nMaximum likelihood can also be used to estimate the parameters x_0 and \\gamma. However, this tends to be complicated by the fact that this requires finding the roots of a high degree polynomial, and there can be multiple roots that represent local maxima. Also, while the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient, it is relatively inefficient for small samples.  The log-likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution for sample size n is:\n\n\\hat\\ell(\\!x_0,\\gamma\\mid x_1,\\dotsc,x_n) - n \\log (\\gamma \\pi) - \\sum_{i\n1}^n \\log \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x_i - x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right)\n\nMaximizing the log likelihood function with respect to x_0 and \\gamma produces the following system of equations:\n\n \\sum_{i1}^n \\frac{x_i - x_0}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - \\!x_0]^2} \n 0\n \\sum_{i1}^n \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} - \\frac{n}{2} \n 0\n\nNote that\n\n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} \n\nis a monotone function in \\gamma and that the solution \\gamma must satisfy\n\n \\min |x_i-x_0|\\le \\gamma\\le \\max |x_i-x_0|. \n\nSolving just for x_0 requires solving a polynomial of degree 2n-1, and solving just for \\gamma requires solving a polynomial of degree n (first for \\gamma^2, then x_0). Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both parameters simultaneously, a numerical solution on a computer is typically required. The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating x_0 using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating x_0 by maximum likelihood. The truncated sample mean using the middle 24% order statistics is about 88% as asymptotically efficient an estimator of x_0 as the maximum likelihood estimate. When Newton's method is used to find the solution for the maximum likelihood estimate, the middle 24% order statistics can be used as an initial solution for x_0.\n\nMultivariate Cauchy distribution\n\nA random vector X(X_1, \\ldots, X_k)' is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components Y\na_1X_1+ \\cdots + a_kX_k has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector a\\in \\mathbb R^k, the random variable Ya'X should have a univariate Cauchy distribution.  The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:\n\n\\varphi_X(t) =  e^{ix_0(t)-\\gamma(t)}, \\!\n\nwhere x_0(t) and \\gamma(t) are real functions with x_0(t) a homogeneous function of degree one and \\gamma(t) a positive homogeneous function of degree one.  More formally:\n\nx_0(at) = ax_0(t),\n\\gamma (at) = |a|\\gamma (t),\n\nfor all t.\n\nAn example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:\nf(x, y; x_0,y_0,\\gamma)= { 1 \\over 2 \\pi } \\left[ { \\gamma \\over ((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 +\\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \\right] .\nNote that in this example, even though there is no analogue to a covariance matrix, x and y are not statistically independent.\n\nAnalogous to the univariate density, the multidimensional Cauchy density also relates to the multivariate Student distribution. They are equivalent when the degrees of freedom parameter is equal to one. The density of a k dimension Student distribution with one degree of freedom becomes:\n\nf({\\mathbf x}; {\\mathbf\\mu},{\\mathbf\\Sigma}, k)= \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1+k}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2})\\pi^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\left|{\\mathbf\\Sigma}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[1+({\\mathbf x}-{\\mathbf\\mu})^T{\\mathbf\\Sigma}^{-1}({\\mathbf x}-{\\mathbf\\mu})\\right]^{\\frac{1+k}{2}}} .\n\nProperties and details for this density can be obtained by taking it as a particular case of the multivariate Student density.\n\nTransformation properties\n\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0,\\gamma)\\, then  kX+l \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0{k}+l,\\gamma |k|)\\,\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0,\\gamma_0)\\, and Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_1,\\gamma_1)\\, are independent, then  X+Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0+x_1,\\gamma_0+\\gamma_1)\\, and  X-Y \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(x_0-x_1,|\\gamma_0-\\gamma_1|)\\,\n*If X \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(0,\\gamma)\\, then  \\tfrac{1}{X} \\sim \\textrm{Cauchy}(0,\\tfrac{1}{\\gamma})\\,\n*McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions:McCullagh, P., [http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/2/247 \"Conditional inference and Cauchy models\"], Biometrika, volume 79 (1992), pages 247–259.
