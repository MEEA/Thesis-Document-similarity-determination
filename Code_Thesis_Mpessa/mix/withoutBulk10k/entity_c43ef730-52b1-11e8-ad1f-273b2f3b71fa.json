  "textBody" : "Arianespace SA is a multinational company founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch service provider. It undertakes the production, operation, and marketing of the Ariane programme. The company offers a number of different launch vehicles: the heavy-lift Ariane 5 for dual launches to geostationary transfer orbit, the Soyuz-2 as a medium-lift alternative, and the solid-fueled Vega for lighter payloads.\n\n, Arianespace has launched more than 550 satellites in 254 launches over  years (236 Ariane missions minus the first 8 flights handled by CNES, 17 Soyuz-2 missions and 9 Vega missions). The first commercial flight managed by the new entity was Spacenet F1 launched on May 23, 1984. Arianespace uses the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana as its main launch site. Through shareholding in Starsem, it can also offer commercial Soyuz launches from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan.

The company had halved subsidy support by €100m per year since 2002 but the fall in the value of the US Dollar meant Arianespace was losing €60m per year due to currency fluctuations on launch contracts. \n\nReducing the cost allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for lower slots on a Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on a SpaceX launch vehicle. \n\nArianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September that year. with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations.  Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth  billion with 38 satellites to be launched on Ariane 5, 7 on Soyuz and 9 on Vega, claiming 60% of the global satellite launch market.\n\nBy November 2014, SpaceX had \"already begun to take market share\" from Arianespace, and Eutelsat CEO Michel de Rosen — a major customer of Arianespace — said that \"Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale.\"\n\nLaunch vehicles \n\nCurrently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5:\n\nAdditionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on H-IIA through Launch Services Alliance.\n\nAriane launch vehicles\n\nSince the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane launch vehicle:\n\n* Ariane 1, first successful launch on December 24, 1979\n* Ariane 2, first successful launch on November 20, 1987 (the first launch on May 30, 1986 failed)\n* Ariane 3, first successful launch on August 4, 1984\n* Ariane 4, first successful launch on June 15, 1988\n* Ariane 5, first successful launch on October 30, 1997 (the first launch on June 4, 1996 failed).\nThe new Ariane 6 vehicle is in development.
