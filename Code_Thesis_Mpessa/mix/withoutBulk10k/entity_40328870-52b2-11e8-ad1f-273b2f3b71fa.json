About 9 BC Maroboduus returned to Germania and became ruler of his people. To deal with the threat of Roman expansion into the Rhine-Danube basin he led the Marcomanni to the area later known as Bohemia to be outside the range of the Roman influence. There he took the title of a king and organized a confederation of several neighboring Germanic tribes.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0197%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D3 7, 1, 3, p. 290]; Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History [http://droitromain.upmf-grenoble.fr/Anglica/VelleiusPaterculus2_Shipley.htm#101-110 2, 108] He was the first documented ruler of Bohemia.\n\nAugustus planned in 6 AD to destroy the kingdom of Maroboduus, which he considered to be too dangerous for the Romans.
