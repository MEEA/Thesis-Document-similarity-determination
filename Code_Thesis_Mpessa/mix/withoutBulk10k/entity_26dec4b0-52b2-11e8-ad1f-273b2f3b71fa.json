  "textBody" : "Javier Pedro Saviola Fernández (; born 11 December 1981) is a retired Argentine professional footballer who played as a forward.\n\nKnown for his speed, dribbling and ability to score from almost any attacking position on the field, he represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid and was named as the youngest player on Pelé's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. Due to his ancestry he also holds Spanish nationality since 2004, and he amassed La Liga totals of 196 games and 70 goals over the course of eight seasons; he started and finished his career at River Plate.\n\nAn Argentine international for seven years, Saviola represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and the 2004 Copa América, where his team reached the final. He also won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics.\n\nClub career\n\nRiver Plate\n\nNicknamed El Conejo (The Rabbit),[http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com/EMD03/PUB/2001/07/22/EMD20010722005MDP.pdf El 'Mono' Burgos bautizó a Saviola como el 'Conejo' ('Mono' Burgos dubbed Saviola 'Conejo')]; Mundo Deportivo, 22 July 2001 (in Spanish) Buenos Aires-born Saviola made his debut for Club Atlético River Plate at the age of 16, and went on to be a prolific goalscorer for the club.[http://www.theargentimes.com/culture/sport/interview-with-javier-saviola-/ Interview with Javier Saviola] ; The Argentina Independent, 10 October 2008\n\nHe helped River to the 1999 Apertura and 2000 Clausura championships, and earned the 1999 South American Footballer of the Year award. Still only 18, he gained a reputation as a phenomenal prospect, and was even regarded as a potential heir to Diego Maradona, in particular after he broke the latter's 1978 record by becoming the youngest player to win the Golden Boot award.\n\nBarcelona\n\nIn 2001, aged 19, Saviola moved abroad to play for FC Barcelona in a £15 million transfer. He obtained Spanish citizenship shortly after, thereby not being restricted by the Spanish league maximum on the number of non-European Union citizens allowed in each club. Under coach Carles Rexach, he scored 17 goals in his first season, finishing joint-fourth top scorer in La Liga.\n\nSaviola's second year at the club did not start well, as he only scored two goals in the first half of the season. When Van Gaal was fired and Radomir Antić became the new Barcelona manager, he went on to net 11 goals in the latter half of the campaign; at the start of the following season Frank Rijkaard was appointed as new manager, and the player scored 14 times in the league alone, but was deemed surplus at the club as longtime offensive partner Patrick Kluivert.\n\nSaviola was sent on loan in the summer of 2004, moving to AS Monaco FC in Ligue 1. As he did not fit into Rijkaard's plans he was again loaned out the following year, this time to Spanish club Sevilla FC, in order to replace Real Madrid-bound Júlio Baptista; with his new club he won his first title in Europe, conquering the UEFA Cup — he also scored nine times in the league, good enough for fifth.\n\nSaviola returned to Barcelona for the 2006–07 season,[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2006/08/31/futbol/1157027406.html Saviola seguirá en el Barça aunque Rijkaard no cuenta con él (Saviola to continue in Barça even though Rijkaard does not want him)]; El Mundo, 31 August 2006 (in Spanish) playing in 18 league games, six as a starter, and netting five goals.

Anderlecht also at the Karaiskakis Stadium for the group stage's last round, which helped the Piraeus outfit to the second position and the subsequent qualification, at the expense of former side Benfica.\n\nVerona\n\nOn 2 September 2014, Saviola joined Serie A club Hellas Verona FC. He made his official debut on 22 September, starting in a 2–2 home draw against Genoa CFC, and scored his first goal on 2 December, netting the only in a home win over Perugia Calcio for the Coppa Italia. His sole goal of the league season came on 25 January 2015, the only one in a home victory over Atalanta BC.\n\nReturn to River\n\nOn 30 June 2015, River Plate announced that Saviola had returned to the club. He left in January of the following year, after failing to find the net in his second spell.\n\nImmediately after retiring, 34-year-old Saviola was appointed assistant manager at FC Ordino in the Andorran Primera Divisió.\n\nInternational career\n\nSaviola starred in the 2001 edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup, held in Argentina.
