  "textBody" : "Transportation in the Dominican Republic is composed of a system of roads, airports, ports, harbours and an urban railway:\n\nRoadways \n\nThere are five main highways (DR-1, DR-2, DR-3, DR-4, DR-5) they are in good condition in the Dominican Republic connecting its biggest cities and tourist centers. There are nearly  of highways and roads, 9,872 being paved and  (2002 est.) unpaved. Like any underdeveloped nation, the Dominican Republic suffers from lack of good paved roads to connect smaller towns and less populated areas though they are working on it, however major town roads are kept in good condition.\n\nPublic transport \n\nMass transit \n\nThe Santo Domingo Metro is the first mass transit system in the country, and second in the Caribbean & Central American nations after the Tren Urbano in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  On February 27, 2008 the incumbent president Leonel Fernández test rode the system for the first time and free service was offered thereafter several times.  Commercial service started on January 30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently being planned.\n\nThe Santiago light rail system is a planned light rail system in the Dominican Republic's second largest city, still in developing stages it was said to start on mid-2008 but right now is currently on hold due to lack of approval and of central government funds.\n\nBuses\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a bus system that is rather reliable, and most of these public transportation vehicles are fairly comfortable. The fare is generally inexpensive, and there are bus terminals and stops in most of the island's major cities.\n\nPublic Cars (Carros Públicos)\n\nThe Public Cars (Carros Públicos–Conchos) are privately owned passenger cars that transit a specific route daily and passengers pay a certain fee with the convenience of stopping anywhere.  This comprises one of the main ways of transportation inside the capital city of Santo Domingo, as well as other major cities.\nThis system though, is not very reliable and lacks discipline. The high number of public cars that travel the roads, and the fact that they do not lend themselves to regulation or central control, causes frequent transit problems among city roads. They may also be somewhat uncomfortable, since they try to fit as many people as possible inside them. As a standard, a 4-person sedan (driver included) usually carries 6 passengers, twice the amount for which they were designed.\n\nRailways \n\nRail operations are provided by one state owned operator and several private operators (mainly for sugar mills):\n* Central Romana Railroad was established in 1911 in the sugarcane fields. The total length of the line is ,  being the  standard gauge.\n* The Dominican Republic Government Railway is a   narrow gauge railway.\n* There are  operated by other sugarcane companies in various gauges: , ,  gauges (1995).\n* There are no connections with Haiti.\n* A rapid transit system, Santo Domingo Metro, opened in 2008 in the capital. The Santiago Light Rail has been planned to serve the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.\n\nPorts and harbors \n\nMajor ports and harbours in the Dominican Republic:\n\nPorts\n\n*The Port of Santo Domingo, with its location in the Caribbean, is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road, and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\n*Haina Occidental Port, located just 20 km west of Santo Domingo, is one of the most important ports in the Dominican Republic.

This port is mainly used to discharge bulk fertilizer. Cement clinker, coal, wheat, diesel and LPG. It is also used to export sugar and molasses produced by several sugar cane mills in the region.\n*Central Romana Port, located in La Romana, belong to Central Romana Corporation which is a private company established in 1911 and has the largest sugar mill in the country.\n\nThe following six local ports are a single pier with berth facility:\n\n*Cayo Levantado Port or (Arroyo Barruk/Puerto Duarte) is located in the Samaná Bay.\n*Manzanillo Port is located very close to the Haitian border.\n*Port of Cabo Rojo is located in Cabo Rojo, southeast to the border.\n*Port of Barahona is located in Barahona, in the bay of Neyba.\n*Port of Azua in Azua, also called Puerto Viejo is located at Ocoa Bay.\n*Palenque Port is located southwest of Santo Domingo.\n\nhttp://www.cei-rd.gov.do/download/brochures/Investment-brochure.pdf\n\nA local ferry service runs daily between the Samaná and Sabana del Mar ports.\n\nMerchant marine\n\n*Total:\n**1 ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 1,587 GRT/\n*Ships by type:\n**cargo 1 (1999 est.)\n\nEntering the ports\n\nBoaters and sailors who wish to dock in any of DR's ports must follow certain entry requirements: \n* Upon approaching the port, ships must display a quarantine flag, which has the letter 'Q' on it, and wait for admittance into the port.\n* The passengers of the vessel must pay a fee, get a tourist card, and show proper identification including a valid passport.\n* Military officials must sometimes grant the passengers clearance to come ashore.\n\nAirports \n\n \n\nThere are 7 major and 31 minor airports in the DR (2009):\n\n* Las Américas International Airport, Santo Domingo City, Santo Domingo\n* Punta Cana International Airport, Punta Cana / Higüey\n* Cibao International Airport, Santiago City, Santiago\n* Gregorio Luperón International Airport, Puerto Plata\n* La Romana International Airport, La Romana City, La Romana\n* Samana El Catey International Airport, Sanchez, Samana\n* María Montez International Airport, Barahona City, Barahona\n\nAirports - with paved runways\n\n*Total:  10  (1999 est.)\n**Over 3,047 m:      3\n**2,438 to 3,047 m:  1\n**1,524 to 2,437 m:  4\n**914 to 1,523 m:    3\n**under 913 m:       2\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways\n\n*Total:  15  (1999 est.)\n**1,524 to 2,437 m:  2\n**914 to 1,523 m:    4\n**under 914 m:       9\n\nNational airlines\n\n* Dominicana de Aviación used to be the country's national airline for a large period of time.
