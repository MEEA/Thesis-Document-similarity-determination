She grew up in Palmdale, California, the daughter of Norwegian-American parents, Elsie Soliah (née Engstrom) and Palmdale High School English teacher and coach Martin Soliah. She went into hiding in 1976 after having been indicted in a bombing case. She has lived much of her life under the alias Sara Jane Olson, which is now her legal name. Arrested in 1999, she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder, and in 2003 to second-degree murder, both stemming from her SLA activities in the 1970s. She received a sentence of 14 years in prison.\n\nShe was mistakenly released for five days in March 2008, due to an error made in calculating her parole, before being rearrested.[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/22/olson.custody/index.html \"70's radical-turned-housewife back in prison\"], CNN, March 22, 2008 She was finally released on parole on March 17, 2009.[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/sns-ap-sla-olson,0,5802667.story \"Former 1970s radical freed from Calif. prison, to be paroled home in Minnesota\"], The Baltimore Sun, AP, March 17, 2009\n\nSymbionese Liberation Army\n\nKathleen Soliah was born in Fargo, North Dakota, while her family were living in Barnesville, Minnesota.

There, she met Angela Atwood at an acting audition where they both won lead roles. They became inseparable during the play's run. Atwood tried to sponsor Soliah into the SLA.

In 2002, new forensics technology allowed police to link these shells definitively to those found at Crocker Bank prior to charging the former members of SLA, including Soliah, with the crime.

After the bomb was discovered, all Los Angeles police were ordered to search under their cars, and another bomb was found in front of a police department about a mile away. Soliah was accused of planting the bombs in an attempt to avenge the SLA members who had died a year earlier in the standoff with LA police.\n\nThe pipe bombs were rigged to detonate as the patrol cars drove away. One police officer present that day described the first bomb as one of \"the most dangerous pipe bombs he had ever seen\" and went on to say: \n\nAt Soliah's 2002 sentencing hearing on the bombing, police officer John Hall, who had been in the car on top of the bomb described a little girl who stood feet away with her family: \n\nSoliah was indicted in 1976 for setting the police bombs along with five other SLA members, but vanished before the trial could commence. When Soliah was eventually brought to trial years later, the evidence against her was not considered by prosecutors to be a \"slam dunk\", although enough to convince a jury of her guilt. Two witnesses who had originally testified in her grand jury indictment had died by the time she was found and brought to trial: a plumber who had sold materials used in the bomb had picked Soliah out of a lineup as one of the buyers, and a bomb expert had stated the explosive could have been built in Soliah's apartment. Police could not identify any fingerprints on the devices other than those of the officers who had disarmed them; however, Soliah's fingerprint, handwriting and signature were identified on a letter sent to order a fuse that could only be used for bomb-making purposes, and components matching those used in the police car bombs were found in a locked closet at the Precita Avenue hideout that Soliah lived in with the other members of SLA.\n\nUnderground life, capture, and prosecution\n\nIn February 1976, a grand jury indicted Soliah in the bombing case. Soliah went underground and became a fugitive for 23 years.\n\nShe moved to Minnesota, having assumed the alias Sara Jane Olson; the surname chosen being one of the most common names in Minnesota due to the large number of people of Scandinavian-Americans descent. In 1980 she married the physician Gerald Frederick \"Fred\" Peterson, with whom she would have three daughters. Olson and Peterson went to Zimbabwe for a while, where Peterson worked for a British Medical missionary group. Then they settled in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where Olson resumed her acting career. She was active in Saint Paul on community issues. Her husband described the family as interested in progressive social causes.\n\nOn March 3, 1999, and again on May 15, 1999, Soliah was profiled on the America's Most Wanted television program. After a tip generated by the show, she was arrested on June 16, 1999. Soliah was then charged with conspiracy to commit murder, possession of explosives, explosion, and attempt to ignite an explosive with intent to murder.\n\nShortly after her arrest, Soliah legally changed her name to her alias, Sara Jane Olson. She also published a cookbook titled Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes. On October 31, 2001, she accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder.[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/07/13_helmsm_sarajanesentence/ \"Sara Jane Olson's 14-year prison sentence thrown out\"] by Marisa Helms, Minnesota Public Radio, July 13, 2004 As part of a plea bargain, the other charges were dropped.\n\nPlea controversy\n\nImmediately after entering the plea, however, Olson told reporters that she was innocent and that she had decided to take a plea bargain due to the climate after the September 11 attacks, in which she felt an accused bomber could not receive a fair trial from a jury. \"It became clear to me that the incident would have a remarkable effect on the outcome of this trial ... the effect was probably going to be negative,\" she said. \"That's really what governed this decision, not the truth or honesty, but what was probably in my best interests and the interests of my family.\"\n\nAngered by Olson's announcement that she had lied in court, Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler ordered another hearing on November 6, at which he asked her several times if she was indeed guilty of the charges. Olson replied \"I want to make it clear, Your Honor, that I did not make that bomb. I did not possess that bomb. I did not plant that bomb.

Rather, she said: \n\nSentencing in explosives charges\n\nOn December 3, 2001, Fidler offered to let Olson testify under oath about her role in the case. She refused. He then wondered \"I took those pleas twice ... were you lying to me then or are you lying to me now?\"—and denied her request to withdraw her plea. Observers expected her to serve only three to five years, but on January 18, 2002, she was sentenced to two consecutive 10-years-to-life terms. Fidler warned that according to California law, the Board of Prison Terms could later change the sentence to a lesser term. Olson's lawyers asserted that due to discrepancies between 1970s laws and current California laws, their client would most likely serve only five years, which could turn into two years for good behavior. The Board of Prison Terms did later change the sentence.\n\nAt her sentencing hearing, Olson's teenage daughter Leila, her pastor, and her husband spoke in her defense, while Olson's mother claimed on the stand that Olson had never been a part of the SLA and spoke against prosecutors and police she asserted had harassed the family.\n\nSentencing in Opsahl murder\n\nOn January 16, 2002, first-degree murder charges for the killing of Myrna Opsahl were filed against Olson and four other SLA members: Emily Harris, Bill Harris, Michael Bortin (Olson's brother-in law who had married her sister Josephine), and James Kilgore, who remained a fugitive. Judge Fidler arraigned Olson on the murder charges immediately following her sentencing hearing on January 18. Olson pleaded not guilty to that charge at the time, but on November 7, she changed her mind and pleaded guilty. She was sentenced on February 14, 2003, for the maximum term allowed under her plea bargain, which was a six-year term concurrent to the 14-year sentence she was already serving.\n\nIncarceration and release\n\nThe state Board of Prison Terms had scrapped her original sentence in October 2002 in exchange for a longer 14-year sentence, saying Olson's crimes had the potential for great violence and targeted multiple victims. In July 2004, a judge said there was \"no analysis\" of how the state Board of Prison Terms had decided 14 years was appropriate, and threw it out.

For five days, she stayed at her mother's home in Palmdale, and spent some time hiking with her husband.\n\nOn March 21, 2008, she was rearrested when it was decided that she had been mistakenly released a year early from prison due to a miscalculation by the parole board. Her attorney claimed that the action was a political move. Olson was taken back into custody by the California Department of Corrections and placed in the California Institution for Women in Corona for an additional year.\n\nRelease and parole\n\nAfter serving a total of seven years, about half of her sentence, Olson was released from prison on March 17, 2009, to serve her parole in Minnesota. Police unions in both Minnesota and California protested the arrangement, stating that they believe her parole should be served in California, where her crimes were committed. In a letter to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor Tim Pawlenty also protested Olson being allowed to return to Minnesota.\n\nDaughter competes in American Idol\n\nOlson's 28-year-old daughter, Sophia Shorai, was a contestant in the 2011 season of the talent show American Idol.",

David Nickerson, Olson's attorney, stated that this status reflected the Department of Corrections' view that she was a potential flight risk.\n\nOlson's husband and three daughters continued to support her during her imprisonment and took turns visiting her frequently in Chowchilla.[http://www.marieclaire.com/world/news/Mom-Secret-8 \"When Mom Has A Secret: An Exclusive Report on a Family Torn Apart\"], Tara McKelvey, Marie Claire June 2007.

For five days, she stayed at her mother's home in Palmdale, and spent some time hiking with her husband.\n\nOn March 21, 2008, she was rearrested when it was decided that she had been mistakenly released a year early from prison due to a miscalculation by the parole board. Her attorney claimed that the action was a political move. Olson was taken back into custody by the California Department of Corrections and placed in the California Institution for Women in Corona for an additional year.\n\nRelease and parole\n\nAfter serving a total of seven years, about half of her sentence, Olson was released from prison on March 17, 2009, to serve her parole in Minnesota. Police unions in both Minnesota and California protested the arrangement, stating that they believe her parole should be served in California, where her crimes were committed. In a letter to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor Tim Pawlenty also protested Olson being allowed to return to Minnesota.\n\nDaughter competes in American Idol\n\nOlson's 28-year-old daughter, Sophia Shorai, was a contestant in the 2011 season of the talent show American Idol.
