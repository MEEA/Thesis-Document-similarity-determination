  "textBody" : "In mathematics and computational geometry,  a Delaunay triangulation (also known as a Delone triangulation) for a given set P of discrete points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles. The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.\n\nFor a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation (the notion of triangulation is degenerate for this case).  For four or more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfies the \"Delaunay condition\", i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles of all triangles have empty interiors.\n\nBy considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions.  Generalizations are possible to metrics other than Euclidean distance. However, in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.\n\nRelationship with the Voronoi diagram\n\nThe Delaunay triangulation of a discrete point set P in general position corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram for P. Special cases include the existence of three points on a line and four points on circle.\n\nFile:Delaunay_circumcircles_centers.svg|The Delaunay triangulation with all the circumcircles and their centers (in red).\nFile:Delaunay_Voronoi.svg|Connecting the centers of the circumcircles produces the Voronoi diagram (in red).\n\nd-dimensional Delaunay \n\nFor a set P of points in the (d-dimensional) Euclidean space, a Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circum-hypersphere of any d-simplex in DT(P).  It is known that there exists a unique Delaunay triangulation for P if P is a set of points in general position; that is, the affine hull of P is d-dimensional and no set of d + 2 points in P lie on the boundary of a ball whose interior does not intersect P.\n\nThe problem of finding the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in d-dimensional Euclidean space can be converted to the problem of finding the convex hull of a set of points in (d + 1)-dimensional space, by giving each point p an extra coordinate equal to |p|2, taking the bottom side of the convex hull, and mapping back to d-dimensional space by deleting the last coordinate. As the convex hull is unique, so is the triangulation, assuming all facets of the convex hull are simplices. Nonsimplicial facets only occur when d + 2 of the original points lie on the same d-hypersphere, i.e., the points are not in general position.\n\nProperties\n\nLet n be the number of points and d the number of dimensions.\n\n*The union of all simplices in the triangulation is the convex hull of the points.\n*The Delaunay triangulation contains O(n⌈d / 2⌉) simplices.\n*In the plane (d = 2), if there are b vertices on the convex hull, then any triangulation of the points has at most 2n − 2 − b triangles, plus one exterior face (see Euler characteristic).\n*If points are distributed according to a Poisson process in the plane with constant intensity, then each vertex has on average six surrounding triangles. More generally for the same process in d dimensions the average number of neighbors is a constant depending only on d.. As cited by .\n*In the plane, the Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle.  Compared to any other triangulation of the points, the smallest angle in the Delaunay triangulation is at least as large as the smallest angle in any other.  However, the Delaunay triangulation does not necessarily minimize the maximum angle.. The Delaunay triangulation also does not necessarily minimize the length of the edges. \n*A circle circumscribing any Delaunay triangle does not contain any other input points in its interior.\n*If a circle passing through two of the input points doesn't contain any other of them in its interior, then the segment connecting the two points is an edge of a Delaunay triangulation of the given points.\n* Each triangle of the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in d-dimensional spaces corresponds to a facet of convex hull of the projection of the points onto a (d + 1)-dimensional paraboloid, and vice versa.\n* The closest neighbor b to any point p is on an edge bp in the Delaunay triangulation since the nearest neighbor graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation.\n* The Delaunay triangulation is a geometric spanner: the shortest path between two vertices, along Delaunay edges, is known to be no longer than \\frac{4\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 2.418 times the Euclidean distance between them..\n\nVisual Delaunay definition: Flipping \n\nFrom the above properties an important feature arises: Looking at two triangles ABD and BCD with the common edge BD (see figures), if the sum of the angles α and γ is less than or equal to 180°, the triangles meet the Delaunay condition.\n\nThis is an important property because it allows the use of a flipping technique. If two triangles do not meet the Delaunay condition, switching the common edge BD for the common edge AC produces two triangles that do meet the Delaunay condition:\n\n  File:Delaunay_geometry.png|This triangulation does not meet the Delaunay condition (the sum of α and γ is bigger than 180°).\n  File:Point inside circle - Delaunay condition broken.svg |This pair of triangles does not meet the Delaunay condition (the circumcircle contains more than three points).\n  File:Edge Flip - Delaunay condition ok.svg|Flipping the common edge produces a valid Delaunay triangulation for the four points.\n\nThis operation is called a flip, and can be generalised to three and higher dimensions.\n\nAlgorithms\n\nMany algorithms for computing Delaunay triangulations rely on fast operations for detecting when a point is within a triangle's circumcircle and an efficient data structure for storing triangles and edges.  In two dimensions, one way to detect if point D lies in the circumcircle of A, B, C is to evaluate the determinant:\n\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nA_x & A_y & A_x^2 + A_y^2 & 1\\\\\nB_x & B_y & B_x^2 + B_y^2 & 1\\\\\nC_x & C_y & C_x^2 + C_y^2 & 1\\\\\nD_x & D_y & D_x^2 + D_y^2 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}\nA_x - D_x & A_y - D_y & (A_x^2 - D_x^2) + (A_y^2 - D_y^2) \\\\\nB_x - D_x & B_y - D_y & (B_x^2 - D_x^2) + (B_y^2 - D_y^2) \\\\\nC_x - D_x & C_y - D_y & (C_x^2 - D_x^2) + (C_y^2 - D_y^2)\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}\nA_x - D_x & A_y - D_y & (A_x - D_x)^2 + (A_y - D_y)^2 \\\\\nB_x - D_x & B_y - D_y & (B_x - D_x)^2 + (B_y - D_y)^2 \\\\\nC_x - D_x & C_y - D_y & (C_x - D_x)^2 + (C_y - D_y)^2\n\\end{vmatrix} > 0\n\nWhen A, B and C are sorted in a counterclockwise order, this determinant is positive if and only if D lies inside the circumcircle.\n\nFlip algorithms\n\nAs mentioned above, if a triangle is non-Delaunay, we can flip one of its edges.  This leads to a straightforward algorithm: construct any triangulation of the points, and then flip edges until no triangle is non-Delaunay. Unfortunately, this can take Ω(n2) edge flips. While this algorithm can be generalised to three and higher dimensions, its convergence is not guaranteed in these cases, as it is conditioned to the connectedness of the underlying flip graph: this graph is connected for two dimensional sets of points, but may be disconnected in higher dimensions.\n\nIncremental\n\nThe most straightforward way of efficiently computing the Delaunay triangulation is to repeatedly add one vertex at a time, retriangulating the affected parts of the graph.  When a vertex v is added, we split in three the triangle that contains v, then we apply the flip algorithm.  Done naïvely, this will take O(n) time: we search through all the triangles to find the one that contains v, then we potentially flip away every triangle.  Then the overall runtime is O(n2).\n\nIf we insert vertices in random order, it turns out (by a somewhat intricate proof) that each insertion will flip, on average, only O(1) triangles – although sometimes it will flip many more.\nThis still leaves the point location time to improve.  We can store the history of the splits and flips performed: each triangle stores a pointer to the two or three triangles that replaced it.  To find the triangle that contains v, we start at a root triangle, and follow the pointer that points to a triangle that contains v, until we find a triangle that has not yet been replaced.  On average, this will also take O(log n) time.  Over all vertices, then, this takes O(n log n) time.  While the technique extends to higher dimension (as proved by Edelsbrunner and Shah), the runtime can be exponential in the dimension even if the final Delaunay triangulation is small.\n\nThe Bowyer–Watson algorithm provides another approach for incremental construction.  It gives an alternative to edge flipping for computing the Delaunay triangles containing a newly inserted vertex.\n\nUnfortunately the flipping-based algorithms are generally hard to be parallelized, since adding some certain point (e.g. the center point of a wagon wheel) can lead to up to O(n) consecutive flips.

The sweep-hull is created sequentially by iterating a radially-sorted set of 2D points, and connecting triangles to the visible part of the convex hull, which gives a non-overlapping triangulation.
