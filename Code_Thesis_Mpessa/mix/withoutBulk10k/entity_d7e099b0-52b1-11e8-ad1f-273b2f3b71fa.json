  "textBody" : "In probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (CDF, also cumulative density function) of a real-valued random variable X, or just distribution function of X, evaluated at x, is the probability that X will take a value less than or equal to x.\n\nIn the case of a continuous distribution, it gives the area under the probability density function from minus infinity to x.  Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of multivariate random variables.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable X is the function  given by\n\nF_X(x) = \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x),\n\nwhere the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable X takes on a value less than or\nequal to x. The probability that X lies in the semi-closed interval (a, b], where a  \\operatorname{P}(a \n\nIn the definition above, the \"less than or equal to\" sign, \"≤\", is a convention, not a universally used one (e.g. Hungarian literature uses \"X as follows:\n\nF_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t)\\,dt.\n\nIn the case of a random variable X which has distribution having a discrete component at a value b,\n\\operatorname{P}(Xb) \n F_X(b) - \\lim_{x \\to b^{-}} F_X(x).\n\nIf FX is continuous at b, this equals zero and there is no discrete component at b.\n\nProperties \n\nEvery cumulative distribution function F is non-decreasing and right-continuous, which makes it a càdlàg function. Furthermore,\n\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty}F(x)0, \\quad \\lim_{x\\to +\\infty}F(x)\n1.\n\nEvery function with these four properties is a CDF, i.e., for every such function, a random variable can be defined such that the function is the cumulative distribution function of that random variable.\n\nIf X is a purely discrete random variable, then it attains values x1, x2, ... with probability pi = P(xi), and the CDF of X will be discontinuous at the points xi and constant in between:\n\nF(x) \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x) \n \\sum_{x_i \\leq x} \\operatorname{P}(X x_i) \n \\sum_{x_i \\leq x} p(x_i).\n\nIf the CDF F of a real valued random variable X is continuous, then X is a continuous random variable; if furthermore F is absolutely continuous, then there exists a Lebesgue-integrable function f(x) such that\n\nF(b)-F(a) \\operatorname{P}(a\n\nfor all real numbers a and b. The function f is equal to the derivative of F almost everywhere, and it is called the probability density function of the distribution of X.\n\nExamples \n\nAs an example, suppose X is uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0, 1].\nThen the CDF of X is given by\n\nF(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 &:\\ x \n\nSuppose instead that X takes only the discrete values 0 and 1, with equal probability.\nThen the CDF of X is given by\n\nF(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 &:\\ x \n\nDerived functions\n\nComplementary cumulative distribution function (tail distribution)\n\nSometimes, it is useful to study the opposite question and ask how often the random variable is above a particular level.  This is called the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) or simply the tail distribution or exceedance, and is defined as\n\n\\bar F(x) \\operatorname{P}(X > x) \n 1 - F(x).\n\nThis has applications in statistical hypothesis testing, for example, because the one-sided p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. Thus, provided that the test statistic, T, has a continuous distribution,  the one-sided p-value is simply given by the ccdf: for an observed value t of the test statistic\np\\operatorname{P}(T \\ge t) \n \\operatorname{P}(T > t) =1 - F_T(t).\n\nIn survival analysis, \\bar F(x) is called the survival function and denoted  S(x) , while the term reliability function is common in engineering.\n\n;Properties\n* For a non-negative continuous random variable having an expectation, Markov's inequality states that\n: \\bar F(x) \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{E}(X)}{x} .\n* As  x \\to \\infty, \\bar F(x) \\to 0 \\ , and in fact  \\bar F(x) = o(1/x)  provided that \\operatorname{E}(X) is finite.\nProof: Assuming X has a density function f, for any  c> 0 \n:\n\\operatorname{E}(X) = \\int_0^\\infty xf(x) \\, dx \\geq \\int_0^c xf(x) \\, dx + c\\int_c^\\infty f(x) \\, dx\n\nThen, on recognizing \\bar F(c) = \\int_c^\\infty f(x) \\, dx  and rearranging terms,\n:\n0 \\leq c\\bar F(c) \\leq \\operatorname{E}(X) - \\int_0^c x f(x) \\, dx \\to 0 \\text{  as  } c \\to \\infty\n\nas claimed.\n\nFolded cumulative distribution\n\nWhile the plot of a cumulative distribution often has an S-like shape, an alternative illustration is the folded cumulative distribution or mountain plot, which folds the top half of the graph over,\n\nthus using two scales, one for the upslope and another for the downslope. This form of illustration emphasises the median and dispersion (specifically, the mean absolute deviation from the median) of the distribution or of the empirical results.\n\nInverse distribution function (quantile function)\n\nIf the CDF F is strictly increasing and continuous then  F^{-1}( p ), p \\in [0,1],  is the unique real number  x  such that  F(x) = p . In such a case, this defines the inverse distribution function or quantile function.\n\nSome distributions do not have a unique inverse (for example in the case where f_X(x)=0 for all a, causing F_X to be constant).  This problem can be solved by defining, for  p \\in [0,1] , the generalized inverse distribution function: \n\nF^{-1}(p) = \\inf  \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: F(x) \\geq p \\}.\n\n* Example 1: The median is F^{-1}( 0.5 ).\n* Example 2: Put  \\tau = F^{-1}( 0.95 ) .  Then we call  \\tau  the 95th percentile.\n\nSome useful properties of the inverse cdf (which are also preserved in the definition of the generalized inverse distribution function) are:\n\n# F^{-1} is nondecreasing\n# F^{-1}(F(x)) \\leq x\n# F(F^{-1}(p)) \\geq p\n# F^{-1}(p) \\leq x if and only if p \\leq F(x)\n# If Y has a U[0, 1] distribution then F^{-1}(Y) is distributed as F. This is used in random number generation using the inverse transform sampling-method.\n# If \\{X_\\alpha\\} is a collection of independent F-distributed random variables defined on the same sample space, then there exist random variables Y_\\alpha such that Y_\\alpha is distributed as U[0,1] and F^{-1}(Y_\\alpha) = X_\\alpha with probability 1 for all \\alpha.\nThe inverse of the cdf can be used to translate results obtained for the uniform distribution to other distributions.\n\nMultivariate case \n\nWhen dealing simultaneously with more than one random variable the joint cumulative distribution function can also be defined. For example, for a pair of random variables X,Y, the joint CDF F is given by\n\nF(x,y) = \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x,Y\\leq y),\n\nwhere the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable X takes on a value less than or\nequal to x and that Y takes on a value less than or\nequal to y.\n\nEvery multivariate CDF is:\n# Monotonically non-decreasing for each of its variables,\n# Right-continuous in each of its variables,\n# 0\\leq F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\leq 1,\n# \\lim_{x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\rightarrow+\\infty}F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)1 \\text{ and } \\lim_{x_i\\rightarrow-\\infty}F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\n0, \\text{for all } i.\n\nUse in statistical analysis\n\nThe concept of the cumulative distribution function makes an explicit appearance in statistical analysis in two (similar) ways. Cumulative frequency analysis is the analysis of the frequency of occurrence of values of a phenomenon less than a reference value. The empirical distribution function is a formal direct estimate of the cumulative distribution function for which simple statistical properties can be derived and which can form the basis of various statistical hypothesis tests. Such tests can assess whether there is evidence against a sample of data having arisen from a given distribution, or evidence against two samples of data having arisen from  the same (unknown) population distribution.\n\nKolmogorov–Smirnov and Kuiper's tests\n\nThe Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is based on cumulative distribution functions and can be used to test to see whether two empirical distributions are different or whether an empirical distribution is different from an ideal distribution. The closely related Kuiper's test is useful if the domain of the distribution is cyclic as in day of the week. For instance Kuiper's test might be used to see if the number of tornadoes varies during the year or if sales of a product vary by day of the week or day of the month.",
