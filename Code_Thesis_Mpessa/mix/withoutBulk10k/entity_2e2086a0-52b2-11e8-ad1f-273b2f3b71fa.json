The Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990 and the 2006 Lebanon War with Israel severely damaged the country's infrastructure.\n\nRoads\n\nLebanon has an extensive road network throughout the country, generally in good conditions, though it varies. The main roads in the country are:\n\n*Beirut - Byblos - Tripoli - Aarida\n*Beirut - Sidon - Sour - Naqoura\n*Beirut - Bhamdoun Al Mhatta - Chtaura - Masnaa\n*Chtaura - Zahle - Baalbek - Qaa\n*Tripoli - Bcharre - Baalbek\n\nMotorways\n\nPart of the main road network have been updated to dual carriageway, four-lane motorways, which are the following:\n\n*Beirut - Tripoli. Length: 81 km.\n*Beirut - Kfar Badde. Length: 65 km.\n*Beirut - Sofar. Length: 26 km.\n*Tripoli - Khane. Length: 20 km.\n\nBuses\n\nAn overland trans-desert bus service between Beirut, Haifa, Damascus and Baghdad was established by the Nairn Transport Company of Damascus in 1923.\n\nBeirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria. The Lebanese Commuting Company, or LCC in short, is just one of a handful brands of public transportations all over Lebanon.http://www.lccworld.com/profile.asp Company Profile], [http://www.lccworld.com LCC] On the other hand, the publicly owned buses are managed by le Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC), or the \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\" in English.OCFTC Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/middle-east/lebanon/beirut/transport Beirut Transport], [http://www.lonelyplanet.com Lonely Planet]\n\nBuses are popular and inexpensive and can be stopped anywhere along the way simply by hailing. Never take a bus without verifying the destination with the driver. The fair is for LBP1500 ($1). There are Public Buses (are not regular) and Private Buses (are in general better organized than Public buses).\n\nFerries\n\nApart from the international airport, the Port of Beirut is another port of entry. As a final destination, anyone can also reach Lebanon by ferry from Cyprus or by road from Damascus.[http://www.ikamalebanon.com/info/transportation.htm Transportation & Communication], [http://www.ikamalebanon.com Ikama] The Port of Tripoli (Lebanon) is also a port of entry.\n\nTaxis and services\n\nIn order to get from one place to another, people can either use a service or taxis. A \"service\" is a lot cheaper than a \"taxi\" as the passenger would be sharing the cab in the first place unlike the latter, where he would have the cab to himself.\n\nCabs can be recognized by their red license plates (indicating that it is licensed for public transportation). The driver would pull aside for if the person hails while seeing him. He will then ask for his destination and then will decide whether he will drive the passenger with the regular fare, an extra, or not at all.\n\nTypes of taxis in Lebanon\n\n*Service-taxis\n\nOne has to specify one's destination and enter the taxi only if one's destination corresponds to the itinerary of the Service-taxi. The driver stops to pick up additional passengers anywhere on the streets and drop them off generally in main squares and main streets. It remains advantageous with very low fares.\n\nService-Taxi Taxi \n*Local\n**LBP 2000 ($1.33) per person or LBP 4000 ($2.66) per person depending on how close/far the destination is. Prices within Beirut could vary depending on traffic and distance but overall should not exceed LBP 4000 per person (Maximum of LBP 5000 for Beirut outskirts). However, the driver could ask for more if the passenger intends to go to an area with high traffic like Hamra Street.\n*Long Distance\n**Starts from LBP 5.000 ($3.33) and goes up from there. For example, from Beirut to Sidon, the drivers usually charge in between LBP 50,000 ($33.33) and LBP 75,000 ($50).\n*Traditional Taxis\nThe driver must not pick up additional passengers. Most of these taxis are not equipped with meters, so it is important to negotiate the fare before embarking. The regular taxi fare starts at LBP 10,000 ($6.66).\n\n*On-call taxis\nPick up people who have pre-booked by phone. They don’t respond to hails in the street. They don’t have a meter so passengers should ask the operator the price when they are booking the taxi, and double check with the driver at the end of the journey. \n\n*Transportation network companies\nUber, a transportation network company operates in Beirut and quotes the fare before the ride is accepted.\n\nTrains\n\nThe Lebanese rail system is not currently in use, with services having ceased due to the country's political difficulties.\n\nPort infrastructure\n\nAirport\n\nThe main national airport is the Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport and is located in the southern suburbs.
