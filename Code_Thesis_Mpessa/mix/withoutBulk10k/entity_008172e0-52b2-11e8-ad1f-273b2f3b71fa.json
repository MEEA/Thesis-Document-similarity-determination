This type of monopoly is not uncommon in Greenland.\n\nRadio and television\n\nTelevision in Greenland began in the 1960s.\n\nPrivately owned transmitters were created to receive TV from Canada, Iceland, and Denmark. This can date as far back when television was introduced to Greenland in the 1960s. It was possible to receive TV from Canada with a normal household TV antenna, but color transmissions were NTSC and signals were in very bad quality and however in some circumstances, television transmissions were not available at all due to factors such as weather conditions or time of day, even for the people who owned private transmitters. Greenland did not have any local TV service until 1982. \n\nThe state broadcaster is Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR, Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation), which provides one television and one radio service nationwide.[http://knr.gl Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR): Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation].
