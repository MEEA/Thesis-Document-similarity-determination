  "textBody" : "Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses their mind on a particular object, thought or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Meditation may be used to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. It may be done while sitting, repeating a mantra, and closing the eyes in a quiet environment.\n\nMeditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its Asian origins to Western cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life. Meditation is under psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular research to define its possible health effects.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English meditation is derived from the Latin meditatio, from a verb meditari, meaning \"to think, contemplate, devise, ponder\".An universal etymological English dictionary 1773, London, by Nathan Bailey . Note: from the 1773 edition on Google books, not earlier editions.\n\nIn the Old Testament, hāgâ (Hebrew: הגה) means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate.Terje Stordalen, \"Ancient Hebrew Meditative Recitation\", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories, 2013,  pages 17-31 When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, hāgâ became the Greek melete. The Latin Bible then translated hāgâ/melete into meditatio.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996  page 88\nThe use of the term meditatio as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk Guigo II.The Oblate Life by Gervase Holdaway, 2008  page 115\n\nApart from its historical usage, the term meditation was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as dhyāna in Buddhism and in Hinduism, which comes from the Sanskrit root dhyai, meaning to contemplate or meditate.Feuerstein, Georg. [http://www.santosha.com/moksha/meditation1.html \"Yoga and Meditation (Dhyana).\"] Moksha Journal. Issue 1. 2006. , The verb root \"dhyai\" is listed as referring to \"contemplate, meditate on\" and \"dhyāna\" is listed as referring to \"meditation; religious contemplation\" on page 134 of  The term \"meditation\" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm. An edited book about \"meditation\" published in 2003, for example, included chapter contributions by authors describing Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. In the print edition (pp. 54-55), the \"Through the Ages\" box describes \"Christian Meditation\", \"Cabalistic (Jewish) Meditation\", \"Muslim Meditation\", and others. Scholars have noted that \"the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage\" is parallel to the term \"contemplation\" in Christianity,. Page 161 states \"In Christianity, the term 'contemplation' is parallel to the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage\" but in many cases, practices similar to modern forms of meditation were simply called \"prayer\". Christian, Judaic, and Islamic forms of meditation are typically devotional, scriptural or thematic, while Asian forms of meditation are often more purely technical.Halvor Eifring, \"Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Technical Aspects of Devotional Practices\", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories, 2013,  pages 1-16.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced.A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002  page 199–202 Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation,Buddhist scholar B. Alan Wallace has argued that focused attention is a basis for the practice of mindfulness. He writes that \"Truly effective meditation is impossible without focused attention... the cultivation of attentional stability has been a core element of the meditative traditions throughout the centuries\" (p. xi) in  may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution. This paper draws on various lines of evidence to argue that \"Campfire rituals of focused attention created Baldwinian selection for enhanced working memory among our Homo sapiens ancestors.... this emergence was [in part] caused by a fortuitous genetic mutation that enhanced working memory capacity [and] a Baldwinian process where genetic adaptation follows somatic adaptation was the mechanism for this emergence\" (p. 47). Some of the earliest references to meditation are found in the Hindu Vedas of India. Wilson translates the most famous Vedic mantra \"Gayatri\" as: \"We meditate on that desirable light of the divine Savitri, who influences our pious rites\" (Rigveda : Mandala-3, Sukta-62, Rcha-10). Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed via Confucianism and Taoism in China as well as Hinduism, Jainism, and early Buddhism in Nepal and India.\n\nIn the west, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of \"spiritual exercises\" involving attention (prosoche) and concentrationHadot, Pierre; Arnold I. Davidson (1995) Philosophy as a way of life  pages 83-84 and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques.\n\nThe Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE considers Buddhist meditation as a step towards liberation.Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005  pages 15 By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100 CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to Zen (known as Chan in China, Thiền in Vietnam, and Seon in Korea).Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005  pages 50 The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other Asian countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Singapore.Zen Buddhism : a History: Japan by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W.

Mandal 2007  page 63 By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.Spiritual Psychology by Akbar Husain 2006  page 109 Interactions with Indians, Nepalese or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this can not be proved.An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches by John Binns 2002  page 128 Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101021081733/http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html Archived] from [http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html the original]  on February 11, 2014.\n\nWestern Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a \"ladder\" were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms lectio, meditatio, oratio, and contemplatio (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch by George Lane 2005  page 20Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996  page 38The Oblate Life by Gervase Holdaway, 2008  page 109After Augustine: the meditative reader and the text by Brian Stock 2001  page 105\n\nSecular forms of meditation were introduced in India in the 1950s as a Westernized form of Hindu meditative techniques and arrived in Australia in the late 1950sBruhn, O (2017) Ainslie Meares on Meditation. and, the United States and Europe in the 1960s. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion by David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden, Stanton Marlan 2009 ISBN page 559 Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses. Research on meditation began in 1931, with scientific research increasing dramatically during the 1970s and 1980s. Since the beginning of the '70s more than a thousand studies of meditation in English-language have been reported. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.\n\nModern definitions\n\nDefinitions and scope\n\nAs early as 1971, Claudio Naranjo noted that \"The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what meditation is.\"Claudio Naranjo (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, On the Psychology of Meditation. New York: Viking. There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community, as one study recently noted a \"persistent lack of consensus in the literature\" and a \"seeming intractability of defining meditation\".\n\nIn popular usage, the word \"meditation\" and the phrase \"meditative practice\" are often used imprecisely to designate broadly similar practices, or sets of practices, that are found across many cultures and traditions.\n\nSome of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the need to recognize the particularities of the many various traditions. There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation. The differences between the various traditions themselves, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker. To accurately define \"what is meditation\" has caused difficulties for modern scientists. Scientific reviews have proposed that researchers attempt to more clearly define the type of meditation being practiced in order that the results of their studies be made clearer.Lutz, Dunne and Davidson, \"Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction\" in The Cambridge handbook of consciousness by Philip David Zelazo, Morris Moscovitch, Evan Thompson, 2007  page 499-551 [http://compassion.stanford.edu/pdf/Dunne_Ch%2019%20Lutz%20Dunne%20Davidson-1.pdf (proof copy)] (NB: pagination of published was 499-551 proof was 497-550).  Taylor noted that to refer only to meditation from a particular faith (e.g., \"Hindu\" or \"Buddhist\")\n\nThe table shows several definitions of meditation that have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions. Within a specific context, more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word \"meditation\".Besides Lectio and Yoga, examples include Herbert Benson's (1975) Relaxation Response , Jon Kabat-Zinn's (1990) Full Catastrophe Living , and Eknath Easwaran's (1978) Passage Meditation  For example, \"meditation\" is sometimes the translation of meditatio in Latin. Meditatio is the third of four steps of Lectio Divina, an ancient form of Christian prayer. \"Meditation\" also refers to the seventh of the eight limbs of Yoga in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, a step called dhyāna in Sanskrit. Meditation refers to a mental or spiritual state that may be attained by such practices, and also refers to the practice of that state.\n\nThis article mainly focuses on meditation in the broad sense of a type of discipline, found in various forms in many cultures, by which the practitioner attempts to get beyond the reflexive, \"thinking\" mindThis does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond all thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as \"discursive\" or \"logical\" (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al., 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007). (sometimes called \"discursive thinking\"An influential definition by Shapiro (1982; republished 1984, 2008) states that \"meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought\" (p. 6, italics in original); the term \"discursive thought\" has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought (). or \"logic\"Bond, Ospina et al. (2009) – see fuller discussion elsewhere on this page -- report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an \"essential\" component of meditation \"Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process\" (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an \"essential\" component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely \"important but not essential\" (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007, p. 281)) into a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. The terms \"meditative practice\" and \"meditation\" are mostly used here in this broad sense. However, usage may vary somewhat by context – readers should be aware that in quotations, or in discussions of particular traditions, more specialized meanings of \"meditation\" may sometimes be used (with meanings made clear by context whenever possible).\n\nDefinitions in \"living\" dictionaries\n\nDefinitions in the Oxford and Cambridge living dictionaries are \"to focus one's mind for a period of time\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meditate and \"the act of giving your attention to only one thing.\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meditation\n\nPrayer beads\n\nMost of the ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using some type of prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation.Mysteries of the Rosary by Stephen J. Binz 2005  page 3The everything Buddhism book by Jacky Sach 2003  page 175For a general overview see Beads of Faith: Pathways to Meditation and Spirituality Using Rosaries, Prayer Beads, and Sacred Words by Gray Henry, Susannah Marriott 2008  Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads.Meditation and Mantras by Vishnu Devananda 1999  pages 82–83 Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone all the way around the mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads. Specific meditations of each religion may be different.\n\nReligious and spiritual meditation\n\nIndian religions\n\nJainism\n\nIn Jainism, meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the Tirthankara, Rishabha. All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment. They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols. Mahavira practiced deep meditation for twelve years and attained enlightenment. The Acaranga Sutra dating to 500 BCE, addresses the meditation system of Jainism in detail.Ahimsa – The Science Of Peace by Surendra Bothra 1987 Acharya Bhadrabahu of the 4th century BCE practiced deep Mahaprana meditation for twelve years. Kundakunda of 1st century BCE, opened new dimensions of meditation in Jain tradition through his books Samayasāra, Pravachansar and others.Jain Yoga by Acharya Mahapragya 2004 The 8th century Jain philosopher Haribhadra also contributed to the development of Jain yoga through his Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya, which compares and analyzes various systems of yoga, including Hindu, Buddhist and Jain systems.\n\nJain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path. It has three important parts called the Ratnatraya \"Three Jewels\": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom. It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to Dharmya Dhyana and Shukla Dhyana.\n\nThere exists a number of meditation techniques such as pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna, etc. In padāstha dhyāna one focuses on Mantra. A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. Yogasana and Pranayama has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama – breathing exercises – are performed to strengthen the five Pranas or vital energy. Yogasana and Pranayama balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.\n\nContemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts – life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.\n\nAcharya Mahapragya formulated Preksha meditation in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. Asana and Pranayama, meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts. Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhist meditation refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of Buddhism. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient Buddhist texts and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward awakening and nirvana.For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has Enlightenment as its ultimate aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, Nibbana....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber et al. (1991), p. 142: \"Meditation – general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4). The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are bhāvanā,The Pāli and Sanskrit word bhāvanā literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber et al. (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the Pali Canon, in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (Maha-Rahulovada Sutta, MN 62), Ven. Sariputta tells Ven. Rahula (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation ['] of mindfulness of in-&-out breathing.\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.) jhāna/dhyāna,See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), entry for \"jhāna1\"]; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p. 385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\". Pāli Text Society Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of wandering ascetics contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n[T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] dhyāna / [Pali:] jhāna) or \"concentrations\" (samādhi); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.) and vipassana.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices – such as breath meditation and various recollections (anussati) – that are used across Buddhist schools, as well as significant diversity. In the Theravāda tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the Tibetan tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the Satipatthana Sutta, \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called vipassana..., and in one form or another – and by whatever name – are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to Visuddhimagga's oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas\" (p. 227). Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, Nyanaponika (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).\n\nThe Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: samatha) which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: vipassana) which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).These definitions of samatha and vipassana are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" (AN 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269–70, 440 n. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].\n\nAccording to Buddhist theory, through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].\n\nIn the modern era, Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of Buddhist modernism and the lay meditation based Vipassana movement. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the Western world paralleled the spread of Buddhism in the West. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in 1979.\"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979...\" - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term sati) and related meditative practices has in turn led to several mindfulness based therapies.\n\nHinduism\n\nThere are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.\n\nTraditional\n\nIn pre-modern and traditional Hindu religions, Yoga and Dhyana are done to realize union of one's eternal self or soul, one's ātman. In some Hindu traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta this is equated with the omnipresent and non-dual Brahman. In others, such as the dualistic the Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self is referred to as Purusha, a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.\n\nThe earliest clear references to meditation in Hindu literature are in the middle Upanishads and the Mahabharata, the latter of which includes the Bhagavad Gita.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51. The earliest reference is actually in the Mokshadharma, which dates to the early Buddhist period.The Katha Upanishad describes yoga, including meditation. On meditation in this and other post-Buddhist Hindu literature see Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 199. According to Gavin Flood, the earlier Brihadaranyaka Upanishad refers to meditation when it states that \"having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (ātman) within oneself\".\n\nOne of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is Patañjali's Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to kaivalya (\"aloneness\"). These are ethical discipline (yamas), rules (niyamas), physical postures (āsanas), breath control (prāṇāyama), withdrawal from the senses (pratyāhāra), one-pointedness of mind (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and finally samādhi.\n\nLater developments in Hind meditation include the compilation of Hatha Yoga (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development of Bhakti yoga as a major form of meditation and Tantra. Another important Hindu yoga text is the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which makes use of Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy.\n\nIn the sixth chapter of Bhāvārthadipikā commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita by Sri Jñāneśvar (Dnyaneshwar)[https://sites.google.com/site/nathasiddhas/jnanesvar-and-nivritti-nath] meditation in yoga is described as a state caused by the spontaneous awakening of the sacred energy Kundalini (not Prana or Chi), which creates a connection of the individual soul Ātman with universal Spirit - Paramātman.\n\nModern\n\nMeditation in Hinduism has expanded beyond Hinduism to the West. Mantra meditation, with the use of a japa mala and especially with focus on the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, is a central practice of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith tradition and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular New Religious Movements include the Ramakrishna Mission, Vedanta Society, Divine Light Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, Oneness University, and Brahma Kumaris.\n\nSikhism\n\nIn Sikhism, simran (meditation) and good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee's Spiritual goals; without good deeds meditation is futile. When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God's presence and immerge in the divine light. It is only God's divine will or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate. Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib daily Sikh scripture explains:Visits to temples, penance, compassion and charity gain you but a sesame seed of credit. It is hearkening to His Name, accepting and adoring Him that obtains emancipation by bathing in the shrine of soul. All virtues are Yours, O Lord! I have none; Without good deeds one can't even meditate.Nām Japnā involves focusing one's attention on the names or great attributes of God. The practices of Simran and Nām Japnā encourage quiet internal meditation but may be practiced vocally in the sangat (holy congregation). Sikhs believe that there are ten \"gates\" to the body, the nine visible holes (nostrils, eyes, ears, mouth, urethra, anus) and the tenth invisible hole. The tenth invisible hole is the topmost energy level and is called the tenth gate or Dasam Duaar. When one reaches this stage through continuous practice meditation becomes a habit that continues whilst walking, talking, eating, awake and even sleeping. There is a distinct taste or flavour when a meditator reaches this lofty stage of meditation, and experiences absolute peace and tranquility inside and outside the body.\n\nFollowers of the Sikh religion also believe that love comes through meditation on the lord's name since meditation only conjures up positive emotions in oneself which are portrayed through our actions. The first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev Ji preached the equality of all humankind and stressed the importance of living a householder's life instead of wandering around jungles meditating, the latter of which being a popular practice at the time. The Guru preached that we can obtain liberation from life and death by living a totally normal family life and by spreading love amongst every human being regardless of religion.\n\nIn the Sikh religion, kirtan, otherwise known as singing the hymns of God is seen as one of the most beneficial ways of aiding meditation,  and it too in some ways is believed to be a meditation of one kind.\n\nEast-Asian religions\n\nTaoism\n\nTaoist or Daoist meditation has a long history, and has developed various techniques including concentration, visualization, qi cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations. Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by Chinese Buddhism beginning around the 5th century, and later had influence upon Traditional Chinese medicine and the Chinese martial arts.\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in The Encyclopedia of Taoism, ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118. Ding 定 (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". Guan 觀 (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by Tang Dynasty (618–907) Daoist masters based upon the Tiantai Buddhist practice of Vipassanā \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. Cun 存 (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Daoist Shangqing and Lingbao Schools. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within his/her body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even xian 仙/仚/僊, \"immortality\".\n\nThe (late 4th century BCE) Guanzi essay Neiye \"Inward training\" is the oldest received writing on the subject of qi cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques. For instance, \"When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called \"revolving the vital breath\": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.\"Roth, Harold D. (1999), Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh) and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism, Columbia University Press, p. 92.\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist Zhuangzi records zuowang or \"sitting forgetting\" meditation. Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what \"sit and forget\" means: \"I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.\"Mair, Victor H., tr. (1994), Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu, Bantam Books, p. 64.\n\nDaoist meditation practices are central to Chinese martial arts (and some Japanese martial arts), especially the qi-related neijia \"internal martial arts\". Some well-known examples are daoyin \"guiding and pulling\", qigong \"life-energy exercises\", neigong \"internal exercises\", neidan \"internal alchemy\", and taijiquan \"great ultimate boxing\", which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts \"movement in stillness\" referring to energetic visualization of qi circulation in qigong and zuochan \"seated meditation\", versus \"stillness in movement\" referring to a state of meditative calm in taijiquan forms.\n\nIranian religions\n\nBahá'í Faith\n\nIn the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, meditation along with prayer are both primary tools for spiritual development and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God. While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form. However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the Bahá'í writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth at the end of each day. During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Bahá'ís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.\n\nSecular applications\n\nMeditation may be for a religious purpose, but even before being brought to the West it was used in secular contexts. Beginning with the theosophists, meditation has been employed in the West by a number of religious and spiritual movements, such as yoga, New Age and the New Thought movement.\n\nMeditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with systematic desensitization, relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.\n\nFrom the point of view of psychology and physiology, meditation can induce an altered state of consciousness.Deane Shapiro \"Towards an empirical understanding of meditation as an altered state of consciousness\" in Meditation, classic and contemporary perspectives by Deane H. Shapiro, Roger N. Walsh 1984  page 13 Such altered states of consciousness may correspond to altered neuro-physiologic states.New developments in consciousness research by Vincent W. Fallio 2006  page 151\n\nToday, there are many different types of meditation practiced in western culture. Mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving kindness meditations for instance have been found to provide cognitive benefits such as relaxation and decentering. With training in meditation, depressive rumination can be decreased and overall peace of mind can flourish. Different techniques have shown to work better for different people.\n\nAs stated by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a US government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of Alternative Medicine, \"Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being.\"\n\nSound-based meditation\n\nHerbert Benson of Harvard Medical School conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the Transcendental Meditation technique and Tibetan Buddhism. In 1975, Benson published a book titled The Relaxation Response where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation. Also in the 1970s, the American psychologist Patricia Carrington developed a similar technique called Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM). In Norway, another sound-based method called Acem Meditation developed a psychology of meditation and has been the subject of several scientific studies.\n\nBiofeedback has been used by many researchers since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism\n\nThere is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years.The history and varieties of Jewish meditation by Mark Verman 1997  page 1Jacobs, L. (1976) Jewish Mystical Testimonies, Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House Jerusalem Ltd. For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going \"לשוח\" (lasuach) in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63).Kaplan, A. (1978) Meditation and the Bible, Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc., p 101.\n\nSimilarly, there are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that meditation was used by the prophets.The history and varieties of Jewish meditation by Mark Verman 1997  page 45 In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: hāgâ (), which means to sigh or murmur, but also to meditate, and sîḥâ (), which means to muse, or rehearse in one's mind.Kaplan, A. (1985) Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide, New York Schocken Books.\n\nSome meditative traditions have been encouraged in the school of Judaism known as Kabbalah, and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study.Kaplan, A. (1982) Meditation and Kabbalah, Maine, Samuel Weiser, Inc.Matt, D.C. (1996) The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart of Jewish Mysticism, San Francisco, HarperCollins. Aryeh Kaplan has argued that, for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of meditative practice is to understand and cleave to the Divine. Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the Merkabah, from the root /R-K-B/ meaning \"chariot\" (of God).\n\nMeditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called \"hitbodedut\" (התבודדות, alternatively transliterated as \"hisbodedus\"), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav. The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p2 Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of \"hisbonenus\", related to the Sephirah of \"Binah\", Hebrew for understanding.Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p13 This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.\n\nThe Musar Movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character.Claussen, Geoffrey. [https://www.academia.edu/1502958/The_Practice_of_Musar \"The Practice of Musar\"]. Conservative Judaism 63, no. 2 (2012): 3-26. Retrieved June 10, 2014\n\nChristianity\n\nChristian meditation is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God.Christian Meditation for Beginners by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000,  page 7 The word meditation comes from the Latin word meditari, which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a biblical scene involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.An introduction to Christian spirituality by F. Antonisamy, 2000  pages 76-77\n\nThe Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asphttp://www.theholyrosary.org/“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.http://www.loyolapress.com/our-catholic-faith/prayer/personal-prayer-life/different-ways-to-pray/the-rosary-as-a-tool-for-meditation-by-liz-kelly\n\nChristian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with depictions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979  page 12 Unlike Eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of mantras, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979  pages 12-13The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003  page 488\n\nIn Aspects of Christian meditation, the Catholic Church warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation (in English), October 15, 1989] In 2003, in A Christian reflection on the New Age the Vatican announced that the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\".\n[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003 New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds][http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm BBC Feb 4, 2003 Vatican sounds New Age alert][http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html Vatican website]\n\nChristian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.Simple Ways to Pray by Emilie Griffin 2005  page 134\n\nIn Frankfurt, Germany in 2007 the Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim was founded by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. In and by the centre different kinds of church services are offered like for example with elements such as expressionist dance, moreover days of exercises of Christian mysticism, contemplative prayer, meditative singing, meditation courses, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises and retreats\n\nEarly studies on states of consciousness conducted by Roland Fischer Roland Fischer (1971), A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States. In Science, Vol 174 Num 4012 26 November 1971 found evidence of mystical experience description in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. In her autobiography she describes that, at the peak of a praying experience \"... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place\".Saint Teresa, The Life of Saint Teresa, J. M. Cohen, Transl. (Penquin, Baltimore, 1957), p. 142. This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, \"Devotion of Ecstasy\", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.\n\nIslam\n\nRemembrance of God in Islam, which is known by the concept Dhikr is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with fikr (thinking) which leads to knowledge.Sainthood and revelatory discourse by David Emmanuel Singh 2003  page 154 By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.\n\nNumerous Sufi traditions place emphasis upon a meditative procedure which comes from the cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative quiescence is said to have a quality of healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.Dwivedi, Kedar Nath. Review:Freedom from Self, Sufism, Meditation and Psychotherapy. Group Analysis, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 434-436, December 1989\n\nTafakkur or tadabbur in Sufism literally means reflection upon the universe: this is considered to permit access to a form of cognitive and emotional development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the infinite. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.\n\nMeditation in the Sufi traditions is largely based on a spectrum of mystical exercises, varying from one lineage to another. Such techniques, particularly the more audacious, can be, and often have been down the ages, a source of controversy among scholars. One broad group of ulema, followers of the great Al-Ghazali, for example, have in general been open to such techniques and forms of devotion.\n\nIn recent years, meditation or Muraqaba has been popularized in various parts of the world by Silsila Naqshbandia Mujaddadia under Nazim Al-Haqqani and Silsila Azeemia under Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi.\n\nModern spirituality\n\nNew Age\n\nNew Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html Time Magazine, Youth: The Hippies Friday, Jul. 07, 1967]\nNew Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.\n\nPagan and occult religions\n\nReligions and religious movements which use magic, such as Wicca, Thelema, Neopaganism, occultism etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various trance states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.\n\nWestern context\n\nDissemination in the west\n\nMethods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and Sufi practices going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived, and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.The organization [http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international Contemplative Outreach] , which teaches Christian Centering Prayer, has chapters in non-Western locations in Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea (accessed 5 July 2010) Also evident is some extent of influence over Enlightenment thinking through Denis Diderot's Encyclopédie, although he states, \"I find that a meditation practitioner is often quite useless and that a contemplation practitioner is always insane\".\n\nIdeas about Eastern meditation had begun \"seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity\", and such ideas \"came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s.\" The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:\n\nThe World Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, Swami Vivekananda... [founded] various Vedanta ashrams... Anagarika Dharmapala lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; Abdul Baha ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and Soyen Shaku toured in 1907 teaching Zen...\n\nMore recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. Thomas Keating, a founder of Contemplative Outreach, wrote that \"the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West.\" Daniel Goleman, a scholar of meditation, suggested that the shift in interest from \"established religions\" to meditative practices \"is caused by the scarcity of the personal experience of these [meditation-derived] transcendental states – the living spirit at the common core of all religions.\"\n\nAnother suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which \"set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West\", oftentimes as refugees.Taylor (1999, p. 7) stated that \"the increased Soviet influence in India, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Communist Chinese takeover of Tibet and Mongolia, and the increased political influence of Chinese Communism in Korea and Southeast Asia were key forces that collectively set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West. An entirely new generation of them appeared on the American scene and they found a willing audience of devotees within the American counter-culture. Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Swami Satchitananda, Guru Maharaji, Kerpal Singh, Nayanaponika Thera, Swami Rama, Thich Nhat Hanh, Chogyam Trungpa, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Swami Muktananda, Sri Bagwan Rujneesh, Pir Viliyat Kahn, and the Karmapa were but a few of the names that found followers in the United States... [and] the most well known and influential... today remains Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\"\n\nWestern typologies\n\nOrnstein noted that \"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief.\"Robert Ornstein (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, On the Psychology of Meditation. New York: Viking. LCCN 76149720 This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or \"typologies\" are noted here.\n\nProgress on the \"intractable\" problem of defining meditation was attempted by a recent study of views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived) forms of meditation.\"members were chosen on the basis of their publication record of research on the therapeutic use of meditation, their knowledge of and training in traditional or clinically developed meditation techniques, and their affiliation with universities and research centers.. Each member had specific expertise and training in at least one of the following meditation practices: kundalini yoga, Transcendental Meditation, relaxation response, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and vipassana meditation\" (Bond, Ospina et al., 2009, p. 131); their views were combined using \"the Delphi technique... a method of eliciting and refining group judgments to address complex problems with a high level of uncertainty\" (p. 131). The study identified \"three main criteria... as essential to any meditation practice: the use of a defined technique, logic relaxation, and a self-induced state/mode. Other criteria deemed important [but not essential] involve a state of psychophysical relaxation, the use of a self-focus skill or anchor, the presence of a state of suspension of logical thought processes, a religious/spiritual/philosophical context, or a state of mental silence.\" However, the study cautioned, \"It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by 'family resemblances'... or by the related 'prototype' model of concepts.\"The full quotation from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 135) reads: \"It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by 'family resemblances' (Wittgenstein, 1968) or by the related 'prototype' model of concepts (Rosch, 1973; Rosch & Mervin, 1975).\"\n\nIn modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in a variety of ways; many of these emphasize the role of attention.\n\nIn the West, meditation is sometimes thought of in two broad categories: concentrative meditation and mindfulness meditation. These two categories are discussed in the following two paragraphs, with concentrative meditation being used interchangeably with focused attention and mindfulness meditation being used interchangeably with open monitoring:\n\nDirection of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called concentrative meditation), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called mindfulness meditation), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.The full quote from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 130) reads: \"The differences and similarities among these techniques is often explained in the Western meditation literature in terms of the direction of mental attention (Koshikawa & Ichii, 1996; Naranjo, 1971; Orenstein, 1971): A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called concentrative meditation), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called mindfulness meditation), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness (Orenstein, 1971).\"\n\nOne style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object, breathing, image, or words. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment.\n\nOther typologies have also been proposed, and some techniques shift among major categories.\n\nEvidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the categories of meditation, defined by how they direct attention, appear to generate different brainwave patterns. Evidence also suggests that using different focus objects during meditation may generate different brainwave patterns.\n\nMeditation in the workplace\n\nIt is estimated that around a quarter of US employers are using stress reduction initiatives and that the number is growing. Many large companies have introduced mindfulness programs to their employees. In 2010, healthcare benefits company Aetna developed, launched and studied two mindfulness programs, called Viniyoga Stress Reduction and Mindfulness at Work. The goal was to help reduce stress and improve reactions to stress. Aetna now offers its program to its customers. Google also implements mindfulness, offering more than a dozen meditation courses, with the most prominent one, \"Search Inside Yourself\", having been implemented since 2007. General Mills offers the Mindful Leadership Program Series, a course which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, yoga and dialog with the intention of developing the mind's capacity to pay attention.\n\nThe increasing amount of quantifiable research that mindfulness has on the brain and body is one of the major reasons why corporate mindfulness programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that mindfulness meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that mindfulness can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.\n\nAccording to a study on spirituality and performance in organizations, the increase in corporate meditation programs can also be linked to a complex paradigm shift in the structure and system of organizations. The changes in management include a shift from an economic focus to a balance of profits, quality of life, spirituality and social responsibility concerns. For the past 300 years, the mechanical paradigm shaped the economy where the main corporate objectives were to satisfy shareholders by increasing competition and exploitation. The new emerging business paradigm is called the \"Spiritual Movement\" and moves away from a materialistic to a more spiritual orientation. In this new paradigm, a company's competitive advantage resides in how much it invests in its human capital and the qualities of its employees. The shift in business paradigm's can be explained by the fact that the business world is more competitive, globalized and fast-pace than ever. The boundaries between work and home are blurred, where work has become central to people's lives and employees can be connected to their work whenever. The increase in the importance of work has led to an increase in stress and burnout. The workplace is a place where employees spend most of their lives, develop friendships, create value and make meaningful contributions to society. This means that they are looking for satisfaction beyond work. According to a report on emerging cultures, the shift in paradigm can also be explained by American demographics. \"The American adult population is divided into three groups, each with a different set of values and view of the world.\"  The \"Cultural Creatives,\" whom constitute 24% of US adults are the newest and increasingly growing worldview. \"Their values align with ecological sustainability, globalism, women's issues, social conscience, self-actualization and spirituality\". They reflect a major change that has been growing in American culture.\n\nNursing professionals work in a stressful environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses are at high risk for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data analyses revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment.\"  Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.\n\nEmployee turnover rate is a significant problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, turnover rate among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to a substantial number of employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee turnover rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is a significant increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.\n\nForms of meditation\n\nPhysical postures\n\nVarious postures are taken up in some meditation techniques. Sitting, supine, and standing postures are used. Popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism are the full-lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, Seiza, and kneeling positions. Meditation is sometimes done while walking, known as kinhin, or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as samu.\n\nMindfulness\n\nOver the past 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs have become increasingly important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community as a means of helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy.\"In the last 20 years, mindfulness has become the focus of considerable attention for a large community of clinicians and, to a lesser extent, empirical psychology.\" - [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~perlman/0903-EmoPaper/BishopMindfulnessDefinition2004.pdf Mindfulness: A Proposed Operation Definition] Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat.Kabat-Zinn gives the body scan and food meditations in \"Mindfulness for Beginners\" the 2CD set, and Matthieu Ricard gives the letting thoughts arise and pass away in his 2CD set \"Happiness: A Guide to Cultivating Life's Most Important Skill\" Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.\n\nJacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions, especially extreme anxiety.see Progressive muscle relaxation from where these two references were taken showing that this method reduces extreme anxiety, 1)  and 2) \n\nAs a result of the popularity in participation of mindfulness, conferences such as Wisdom 2.0 have arisen. Mindfulness has entered the secular world in many ways, allowing it to reach many different groups of people.\n\nIt has also been shown that mindfulness has resulted in increased antibody titers to the influenza vaccine.\n\nMental silence\n\nSahaja yoga meditation is regarded as a mental silence meditation, and has been shown to correlate with particular brain and brain wave activity. Some studies have led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information. Sahaja meditators scored above peer group for emotional well-being measures on SF-36 ratings.\n\nResearch on meditation\n\nResearch on the processes and effects of meditation is a subfield of neurological research. Modern scientific techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, were used to observe neurological responses during meditation. Since the 1950s, hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the overall methological quality of meditation research is poor, yielding unreliable results. \n\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology and psychiatry have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as reducing depression, stress, and anxiety. Mindfulness is also used in the treatment of drug addiction. Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain. There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight.\n\nA 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on empathy, compassion, and prosocial behaviors found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can \"improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors\".Luberto, C.M., Shinday, N., Song, R. et al. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8 A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Meditation on Empathy, Compassion, and Prosocial Behaviors]. Mindfulness (2017). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8 doi:10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8]\n\nMeditation, religion and drugs\n\nMany major traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, advise members not to consume intoxicants, while others, such as the Rastafarian movements and Native American Church, view drugs as integral to their religious lifestyle.\n\nThe fifth of the five precepts of the Pancasila, the ethical code in the Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist traditions, states that adherents must: \"abstain from fermented and distilled beverages that cause heedlessness.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce altered states of consciousness. In several traditional shamanistic ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the Rastafari movement, cannabis is believed to be a gift from Jah and a sacred herb to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use peyote, as part of religious ceremony, continuing today. In India, the soma drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the Vedas.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as LSD, became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end.\"A Zen Life\" a documentary film about the life of D.T. Suzuki Many practitioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In The Master Game, Robert S de Ropp writes that the \"door to full consciousness\" can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to \"pass beyond the door\" requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as Rick Strassman, believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, \n\nPrevalence of meditation\n\nThe 2012 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (n = 34,525), found 8.0% of US adults used meditation,https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/NHIS/2012/mind-body/meditation, with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively.https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36760 In the 2007 survey meditation use among workers was 9.9% (up from 8.0% in 2002).https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0034.htm\n\nIn popular culture\n\nVarious forms of meditation have been described in popular culture, various religions and the their Ideas of meditation are well highlighted.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses their mind on a particular object, thought or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Meditation may be used to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. It may be done while sitting, repeating a mantra, and closing the eyes in a quiet environment.\n\nMeditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its Asian origins to Western cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life. Meditation is under psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular research to define its possible health effects.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English meditation is derived from the Latin meditatio, from a verb meditari, meaning \"to think, contemplate, devise, ponder\".An universal etymological English dictionary 1773, London, by Nathan Bailey . Note: from the 1773 edition on Google books, not earlier editions.\n\nIn the Old Testament, hāgâ (Hebrew: הגה) means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate.Terje Stordalen, \"Ancient Hebrew Meditative Recitation\", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories, 2013,  pages 17-31 When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, hāgâ became the Greek melete. The Latin Bible then translated hāgâ/melete into meditatio.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996  page 88\nThe use of the term meditatio as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk Guigo II.The Oblate Life by Gervase Holdaway, 2008  page 115\n\nApart from its historical usage, the term meditation was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as dhyāna in Buddhism and in Hinduism, which comes from the Sanskrit root dhyai, meaning to contemplate or meditate.Feuerstein, Georg. [http://www.santosha.com/moksha/meditation1.html \"Yoga and Meditation (Dhyana).\"] Moksha Journal. Issue 1. 2006. , The verb root \"dhyai\" is listed as referring to \"contemplate, meditate on\" and \"dhyāna\" is listed as referring to \"meditation; religious contemplation\" on page 134 of  The term \"meditation\" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm. An edited book about \"meditation\" published in 2003, for example, included chapter contributions by authors describing Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. In the print edition (pp. 54-55), the \"Through the Ages\" box describes \"Christian Meditation\", \"Cabalistic (Jewish) Meditation\", \"Muslim Meditation\", and others. Scholars have noted that \"the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage\" is parallel to the term \"contemplation\" in Christianity,. Page 161 states \"In Christianity, the term 'contemplation' is parallel to the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage\" but in many cases, practices similar to modern forms of meditation were simply called \"prayer\". Christian, Judaic, and Islamic forms of meditation are typically devotional, scriptural or thematic, while Asian forms of meditation are often more purely technical.Halvor Eifring, \"Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Technical Aspects of Devotional Practices\", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories, 2013,  pages 1-16.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced.A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002  page 199–202 Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation,Buddhist scholar B. Alan Wallace has argued that focused attention is a basis for the practice of mindfulness. He writes that \"Truly effective meditation is impossible without focused attention... the cultivation of attentional stability has been a core element of the meditative traditions throughout the centuries\" (p. xi) in  may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution. This paper draws on various lines of evidence to argue that \"Campfire rituals of focused attention created Baldwinian selection for enhanced working memory among our Homo sapiens ancestors.... this emergence was [in part] caused by a fortuitous genetic mutation that enhanced working memory capacity [and] a Baldwinian process where genetic adaptation follows somatic adaptation was the mechanism for this emergence\" (p. 47). Some of the earliest references to meditation are found in the Hindu Vedas of India. Wilson translates the most famous Vedic mantra \"Gayatri\" as: \"We meditate on that desirable light of the divine Savitri, who influences our pious rites\" (Rigveda : Mandala-3, Sukta-62, Rcha-10). Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed via Confucianism and Taoism in China as well as Hinduism, Jainism, and early Buddhism in Nepal and India.\n\nIn the west, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of \"spiritual exercises\" involving attention (prosoche) and concentrationHadot, Pierre; Arnold I. Davidson (1995) Philosophy as a way of life  pages 83-84 and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques.\n\nThe Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE considers Buddhist meditation as a step towards liberation.Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005  pages 15 By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100 CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to Zen (known as Chan in China, Thiền in Vietnam, and Seon in Korea).Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005  pages 50 The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other Asian countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Singapore.Zen Buddhism : a History: Japan by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W.

Mandal 2007  page 63 By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.Spiritual Psychology by Akbar Husain 2006  page 109 Interactions with Indians, Nepalese or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this can not be proved.An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches by John Binns 2002  page 128 Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101021081733/http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html Archived] from [http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html the original]  on February 11, 2014.\n\nWestern Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a \"ladder\" were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms lectio, meditatio, oratio, and contemplatio (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch by George Lane 2005  page 20Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996  page 38The Oblate Life by Gervase Holdaway, 2008  page 109After Augustine: the meditative reader and the text by Brian Stock 2001  page 105\n\nSecular forms of meditation were introduced in India in the 1950s as a Westernized form of Hindu meditative techniques and arrived in Australia in the late 1950sBruhn, O (2017) Ainslie Meares on Meditation. and, the United States and Europe in the 1960s. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion by David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden, Stanton Marlan 2009 ISBN page 559 Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses. Research on meditation began in 1931, with scientific research increasing dramatically during the 1970s and 1980s. Since the beginning of the '70s more than a thousand studies of meditation in English-language have been reported. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.\n\nModern definitions\n\nDefinitions and scope\n\nAs early as 1971, Claudio Naranjo noted that \"The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what meditation is.\"Claudio Naranjo (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, On the Psychology of Meditation. New York: Viking. There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community, as one study recently noted a \"persistent lack of consensus in the literature\" and a \"seeming intractability of defining meditation\".\n\nIn popular usage, the word \"meditation\" and the phrase \"meditative practice\" are often used imprecisely to designate broadly similar practices, or sets of practices, that are found across many cultures and traditions.\n\nSome of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the need to recognize the particularities of the many various traditions. There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation. The differences between the various traditions themselves, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker. To accurately define \"what is meditation\" has caused difficulties for modern scientists. Scientific reviews have proposed that researchers attempt to more clearly define the type of meditation being practiced in order that the results of their studies be made clearer.Lutz, Dunne and Davidson, \"Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction\" in The Cambridge handbook of consciousness by Philip David Zelazo, Morris Moscovitch, Evan Thompson, 2007  page 499-551 [http://compassion.stanford.edu/pdf/Dunne_Ch%2019%20Lutz%20Dunne%20Davidson-1.pdf (proof copy)] (NB: pagination of published was 499-551 proof was 497-550).  Taylor noted that to refer only to meditation from a particular faith (e.g., \"Hindu\" or \"Buddhist\")\n\nThe table shows several definitions of meditation that have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions. Within a specific context, more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word \"meditation\".Besides Lectio and Yoga, examples include Herbert Benson's (1975) Relaxation Response , Jon Kabat-Zinn's (1990) Full Catastrophe Living , and Eknath Easwaran's (1978) Passage Meditation  For example, \"meditation\" is sometimes the translation of meditatio in Latin. Meditatio is the third of four steps of Lectio Divina, an ancient form of Christian prayer. \"Meditation\" also refers to the seventh of the eight limbs of Yoga in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, a step called dhyāna in Sanskrit. Meditation refers to a mental or spiritual state that may be attained by such practices, and also refers to the practice of that state.\n\nThis article mainly focuses on meditation in the broad sense of a type of discipline, found in various forms in many cultures, by which the practitioner attempts to get beyond the reflexive, \"thinking\" mindThis does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond all thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as \"discursive\" or \"logical\" (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al., 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007). (sometimes called \"discursive thinking\"An influential definition by Shapiro (1982; republished 1984, 2008) states that \"meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought\" (p. 6, italics in original); the term \"discursive thought\" has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought (). or \"logic\"Bond, Ospina et al. (2009) – see fuller discussion elsewhere on this page -- report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an \"essential\" component of meditation \"Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process\" (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an \"essential\" component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely \"important but not essential\" (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007, p. 281)) into a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. The terms \"meditative practice\" and \"meditation\" are mostly used here in this broad sense. However, usage may vary somewhat by context – readers should be aware that in quotations, or in discussions of particular traditions, more specialized meanings of \"meditation\" may sometimes be used (with meanings made clear by context whenever possible).\n\nDefinitions in \"living\" dictionaries\n\nDefinitions in the Oxford and Cambridge living dictionaries are \"to focus one's mind for a period of time\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meditate and \"the act of giving your attention to only one thing.\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meditation\n\nPrayer beads\n\nMost of the ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using some type of prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation.Mysteries of the Rosary by Stephen J. Binz 2005  page 3The everything Buddhism book by Jacky Sach 2003  page 175For a general overview see Beads of Faith: Pathways to Meditation and Spirituality Using Rosaries, Prayer Beads, and Sacred Words by Gray Henry, Susannah Marriott 2008  Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads.Meditation and Mantras by Vishnu Devananda 1999  pages 82–83 Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone all the way around the mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads. Specific meditations of each religion may be different.\n\nReligious and spiritual meditation\n\nIndian religions\n\nJainism\n\nIn Jainism, meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the Tirthankara, Rishabha. All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment. They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols. Mahavira practiced deep meditation for twelve years and attained enlightenment. The Acaranga Sutra dating to 500 BCE, addresses the meditation system of Jainism in detail.Ahimsa – The Science Of Peace by Surendra Bothra 1987 Acharya Bhadrabahu of the 4th century BCE practiced deep Mahaprana meditation for twelve years. Kundakunda of 1st century BCE, opened new dimensions of meditation in Jain tradition through his books Samayasāra, Pravachansar and others.Jain Yoga by Acharya Mahapragya 2004 The 8th century Jain philosopher Haribhadra also contributed to the development of Jain yoga through his Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya, which compares and analyzes various systems of yoga, including Hindu, Buddhist and Jain systems.\n\nJain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path. It has three important parts called the Ratnatraya \"Three Jewels\": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom. It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to Dharmya Dhyana and Shukla Dhyana.\n\nThere exists a number of meditation techniques such as pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna, etc. In padāstha dhyāna one focuses on Mantra. A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. Yogasana and Pranayama has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama – breathing exercises – are performed to strengthen the five Pranas or vital energy. Yogasana and Pranayama balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.\n\nContemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts – life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.\n\nAcharya Mahapragya formulated Preksha meditation in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. Asana and Pranayama, meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts. Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhist meditation refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of Buddhism. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient Buddhist texts and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward awakening and nirvana.For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has Enlightenment as its ultimate aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, Nibbana....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber et al. (1991), p. 142: \"Meditation – general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4). The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are bhāvanā,The Pāli and Sanskrit word bhāvanā literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber et al. (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the Pali Canon, in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (Maha-Rahulovada Sutta, MN 62), Ven. Sariputta tells Ven. Rahula (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation ['] of mindfulness of in-&-out breathing.\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.) jhāna/dhyāna,See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), entry for \"jhāna1\"]; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p. 385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\". Pāli Text Society Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of wandering ascetics contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n[T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] dhyāna / [Pali:] jhāna) or \"concentrations\" (samādhi); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.) and vipassana.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices – such as breath meditation and various recollections (anussati) – that are used across Buddhist schools, as well as significant diversity. In the Theravāda tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the Tibetan tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the Satipatthana Sutta, \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called vipassana..., and in one form or another – and by whatever name – are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to Visuddhimagga's oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas\" (p. 227). Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, Nyanaponika (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).\n\nThe Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: samatha) which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: vipassana) which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).These definitions of samatha and vipassana are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" (AN 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269–70, 440 n. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].\n\nAccording to Buddhist theory, through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].\n\nIn the modern era, Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of Buddhist modernism and the lay meditation based Vipassana movement. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the Western world paralleled the spread of Buddhism in the West. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in 1979.\"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979...\" - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term sati) and related meditative practices has in turn led to several mindfulness based therapies.\n\nHinduism\n\nThere are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.\n\nTraditional\n\nIn pre-modern and traditional Hindu religions, Yoga and Dhyana are done to realize union of one's eternal self or soul, one's ātman. In some Hindu traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta this is equated with the omnipresent and non-dual Brahman. In others, such as the dualistic the Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self is referred to as Purusha, a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.\n\nThe earliest clear references to meditation in Hindu literature are in the middle Upanishads and the Mahabharata, the latter of which includes the Bhagavad Gita.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51. The earliest reference is actually in the Mokshadharma, which dates to the early Buddhist period.The Katha Upanishad describes yoga, including meditation. On meditation in this and other post-Buddhist Hindu literature see Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 199. According to Gavin Flood, the earlier Brihadaranyaka Upanishad refers to meditation when it states that \"having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (ātman) within oneself\".\n\nOne of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is Patañjali's Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to kaivalya (\"aloneness\"). These are ethical discipline (yamas), rules (niyamas), physical postures (āsanas), breath control (prāṇāyama), withdrawal from the senses (pratyāhāra), one-pointedness of mind (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and finally samādhi.\n\nLater developments in Hind meditation include the compilation of Hatha Yoga (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development of Bhakti yoga as a major form of meditation and Tantra. Another important Hindu yoga text is the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which makes use of Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy.\n\nIn the sixth chapter of Bhāvārthadipikā commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita by Sri Jñāneśvar (Dnyaneshwar)[https://sites.google.com/site/nathasiddhas/jnanesvar-and-nivritti-nath] meditation in yoga is described as a state caused by the spontaneous awakening of the sacred energy Kundalini (not Prana or Chi), which creates a connection of the individual soul Ātman with universal Spirit - Paramātman.\n\nModern\n\nMeditation in Hinduism has expanded beyond Hinduism to the West. Mantra meditation, with the use of a japa mala and especially with focus on the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, is a central practice of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith tradition and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular New Religious Movements include the Ramakrishna Mission, Vedanta Society, Divine Light Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, Oneness University, and Brahma Kumaris.\n\nSikhism\n\nIn Sikhism, simran (meditation) and good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee's Spiritual goals; without good deeds meditation is futile. When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God's presence and immerge in the divine light. It is only God's divine will or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate. Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib daily Sikh scripture explains:Visits to temples, penance, compassion and charity gain you but a sesame seed of credit. It is hearkening to His Name, accepting and adoring Him that obtains emancipation by bathing in the shrine of soul. All virtues are Yours, O Lord! I have none; Without good deeds one can't even meditate.Nām Japnā involves focusing one's attention on the names or great attributes of God. The practices of Simran and Nām Japnā encourage quiet internal meditation but may be practiced vocally in the sangat (holy congregation). Sikhs believe that there are ten \"gates\" to the body, the nine visible holes (nostrils, eyes, ears, mouth, urethra, anus) and the tenth invisible hole. The tenth invisible hole is the topmost energy level and is called the tenth gate or Dasam Duaar. When one reaches this stage through continuous practice meditation becomes a habit that continues whilst walking, talking, eating, awake and even sleeping. There is a distinct taste or flavour when a meditator reaches this lofty stage of meditation, and experiences absolute peace and tranquility inside and outside the body.\n\nFollowers of the Sikh religion also believe that love comes through meditation on the lord's name since meditation only conjures up positive emotions in oneself which are portrayed through our actions. The first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev Ji preached the equality of all humankind and stressed the importance of living a householder's life instead of wandering around jungles meditating, the latter of which being a popular practice at the time. The Guru preached that we can obtain liberation from life and death by living a totally normal family life and by spreading love amongst every human being regardless of religion.\n\nIn the Sikh religion, kirtan, otherwise known as singing the hymns of God is seen as one of the most beneficial ways of aiding meditation,  and it too in some ways is believed to be a meditation of one kind.\n\nEast-Asian religions\n\nTaoism\n\nTaoist or Daoist meditation has a long history, and has developed various techniques including concentration, visualization, qi cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations. Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by Chinese Buddhism beginning around the 5th century, and later had influence upon Traditional Chinese medicine and the Chinese martial arts.\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in The Encyclopedia of Taoism, ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118. Ding 定 (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". Guan 觀 (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by Tang Dynasty (618–907) Daoist masters based upon the Tiantai Buddhist practice of Vipassanā \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. Cun 存 (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Daoist Shangqing and Lingbao Schools. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within his/her body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even xian 仙/仚/僊, \"immortality\".\n\nThe (late 4th century BCE) Guanzi essay Neiye \"Inward training\" is the oldest received writing on the subject of qi cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques. For instance, \"When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called \"revolving the vital breath\": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.\"Roth, Harold D. (1999), Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh) and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism, Columbia University Press, p. 92.\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist Zhuangzi records zuowang or \"sitting forgetting\" meditation. Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what \"sit and forget\" means: \"I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.\"Mair, Victor H., tr. (1994), Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu, Bantam Books, p. 64.\n\nDaoist meditation practices are central to Chinese martial arts (and some Japanese martial arts), especially the qi-related neijia \"internal martial arts\". Some well-known examples are daoyin \"guiding and pulling\", qigong \"life-energy exercises\", neigong \"internal exercises\", neidan \"internal alchemy\", and taijiquan \"great ultimate boxing\", which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts \"movement in stillness\" referring to energetic visualization of qi circulation in qigong and zuochan \"seated meditation\", versus \"stillness in movement\" referring to a state of meditative calm in taijiquan forms.\n\nIranian religions\n\nBahá'í Faith\n\nIn the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, meditation along with prayer are both primary tools for spiritual development and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God. While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form. However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the Bahá'í writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth at the end of each day. During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Bahá'ís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.\n\nSecular applications\n\nMeditation may be for a religious purpose, but even before being brought to the West it was used in secular contexts. Beginning with the theosophists, meditation has been employed in the West by a number of religious and spiritual movements, such as yoga, New Age and the New Thought movement.\n\nMeditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with systematic desensitization, relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.\n\nFrom the point of view of psychology and physiology, meditation can induce an altered state of consciousness.Deane Shapiro \"Towards an empirical understanding of meditation as an altered state of consciousness\" in Meditation, classic and contemporary perspectives by Deane H. Shapiro, Roger N. Walsh 1984  page 13 Such altered states of consciousness may correspond to altered neuro-physiologic states.New developments in consciousness research by Vincent W. Fallio 2006  page 151\n\nToday, there are many different types of meditation practiced in western culture. Mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving kindness meditations for instance have been found to provide cognitive benefits such as relaxation and decentering. With training in meditation, depressive rumination can be decreased and overall peace of mind can flourish. Different techniques have shown to work better for different people.\n\nAs stated by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a US government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of Alternative Medicine, \"Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being.\"\n\nSound-based meditation\n\nHerbert Benson of Harvard Medical School conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the Transcendental Meditation technique and Tibetan Buddhism. In 1975, Benson published a book titled The Relaxation Response where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation. Also in the 1970s, the American psychologist Patricia Carrington developed a similar technique called Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM). In Norway, another sound-based method called Acem Meditation developed a psychology of meditation and has been the subject of several scientific studies.\n\nBiofeedback has been used by many researchers since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism\n\nThere is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years.The history and varieties of Jewish meditation by Mark Verman 1997  page 1Jacobs, L. (1976) Jewish Mystical Testimonies, Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House Jerusalem Ltd. For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going \"לשוח\" (lasuach) in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63).Kaplan, A. (1978) Meditation and the Bible, Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc., p 101.\n\nSimilarly, there are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that meditation was used by the prophets.The history and varieties of Jewish meditation by Mark Verman 1997  page 45 In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: hāgâ (), which means to sigh or murmur, but also to meditate, and sîḥâ (), which means to muse, or rehearse in one's mind.Kaplan, A. (1985) Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide, New York Schocken Books.\n\nSome meditative traditions have been encouraged in the school of Judaism known as Kabbalah, and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study.Kaplan, A. (1982) Meditation and Kabbalah, Maine, Samuel Weiser, Inc.Matt, D.C. (1996) The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart of Jewish Mysticism, San Francisco, HarperCollins. Aryeh Kaplan has argued that, for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of meditative practice is to understand and cleave to the Divine. Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the Merkabah, from the root /R-K-B/ meaning \"chariot\" (of God).\n\nMeditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called \"hitbodedut\" (התבודדות, alternatively transliterated as \"hisbodedus\"), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav. The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p2 Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of \"hisbonenus\", related to the Sephirah of \"Binah\", Hebrew for understanding.Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p13 This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.\n\nThe Musar Movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character.Claussen, Geoffrey. [https://www.academia.edu/1502958/The_Practice_of_Musar \"The Practice of Musar\"]. Conservative Judaism 63, no. 2 (2012): 3-26. Retrieved June 10, 2014\n\nChristianity\n\nChristian meditation is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God.Christian Meditation for Beginners by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000,  page 7 The word meditation comes from the Latin word meditari, which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a biblical scene involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.An introduction to Christian spirituality by F. Antonisamy, 2000  pages 76-77\n\nThe Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asphttp://www.theholyrosary.org/“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.http://www.loyolapress.com/our-catholic-faith/prayer/personal-prayer-life/different-ways-to-pray/the-rosary-as-a-tool-for-meditation-by-liz-kelly\n\nChristian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with depictions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979  page 12 Unlike Eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of mantras, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.Christian Meditation by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979  pages 12-13The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003  page 488\n\nIn Aspects of Christian meditation, the Catholic Church warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation (in English), October 15, 1989] In 2003, in A Christian reflection on the New Age the Vatican announced that the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\".\n[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003 New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds][http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm BBC Feb 4, 2003 Vatican sounds New Age alert][http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html Vatican website]\n\nChristian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.Simple Ways to Pray by Emilie Griffin 2005  page 134\n\nIn Frankfurt, Germany in 2007 the Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim was founded by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. In and by the centre different kinds of church services are offered like for example with elements such as expressionist dance, moreover days of exercises of Christian mysticism, contemplative prayer, meditative singing, meditation courses, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises and retreats\n\nEarly studies on states of consciousness conducted by Roland Fischer Roland Fischer (1971), A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States. In Science, Vol 174 Num 4012 26 November 1971 found evidence of mystical experience description in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. In her autobiography she describes that, at the peak of a praying experience \"... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place\".Saint Teresa, The Life of Saint Teresa, J. M. Cohen, Transl. (Penquin, Baltimore, 1957), p. 142. This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, \"Devotion of Ecstasy\", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.\n\nIslam\n\nRemembrance of God in Islam, which is known by the concept Dhikr is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with fikr (thinking) which leads to knowledge.Sainthood and revelatory discourse by David Emmanuel Singh 2003  page 154 By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.\n\nNumerous Sufi traditions place emphasis upon a meditative procedure which comes from the cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative quiescence is said to have a quality of healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.Dwivedi, Kedar Nath. Review:Freedom from Self, Sufism, Meditation and Psychotherapy. Group Analysis, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 434-436, December 1989\n\nTafakkur or tadabbur in Sufism literally means reflection upon the universe: this is considered to permit access to a form of cognitive and emotional development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the infinite. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.\n\nMeditation in the Sufi traditions is largely based on a spectrum of mystical exercises, varying from one lineage to another. Such techniques, particularly the more audacious, can be, and often have been down the ages, a source of controversy among scholars. One broad group of ulema, followers of the great Al-Ghazali, for example, have in general been open to such techniques and forms of devotion.\n\nIn recent years, meditation or Muraqaba has been popularized in various parts of the world by Silsila Naqshbandia Mujaddadia under Nazim Al-Haqqani and Silsila Azeemia under Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi.\n\nModern spirituality\n\nNew Age\n\nNew Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html Time Magazine, Youth: The Hippies Friday, Jul. 07, 1967]\nNew Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.\n\nPagan and occult religions\n\nReligions and religious movements which use magic, such as Wicca, Thelema, Neopaganism, occultism etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various trance states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.\n\nWestern context\n\nDissemination in the west\n\nMethods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and Sufi practices going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived, and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.The organization [http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international Contemplative Outreach] , which teaches Christian Centering Prayer, has chapters in non-Western locations in Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea (accessed 5 July 2010) Also evident is some extent of influence over Enlightenment thinking through Denis Diderot's Encyclopédie, although he states, \"I find that a meditation practitioner is often quite useless and that a contemplation practitioner is always insane\".\n\nIdeas about Eastern meditation had begun \"seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity\", and such ideas \"came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s.\" The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:\n\nThe World Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, Swami Vivekananda... [founded] various Vedanta ashrams... Anagarika Dharmapala lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; Abdul Baha ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and Soyen Shaku toured in 1907 teaching Zen...\n\nMore recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. Thomas Keating, a founder of Contemplative Outreach, wrote that \"the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West.\" Daniel Goleman, a scholar of meditation, suggested that the shift in interest from \"established religions\" to meditative practices \"is caused by the scarcity of the personal experience of these [meditation-derived] transcendental states – the living spirit at the common core of all religions.\"\n\nAnother suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which \"set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West\", oftentimes as refugees.Taylor (1999, p. 7) stated that \"the increased Soviet influence in India, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Communist Chinese takeover of Tibet and Mongolia, and the increased political influence of Chinese Communism in Korea and Southeast Asia were key forces that collectively set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West. An entirely new generation of them appeared on the American scene and they found a willing audience of devotees within the American counter-culture. Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Swami Satchitananda, Guru Maharaji, Kerpal Singh, Nayanaponika Thera, Swami Rama, Thich Nhat Hanh, Chogyam Trungpa, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Swami Muktananda, Sri Bagwan Rujneesh, Pir Viliyat Kahn, and the Karmapa were but a few of the names that found followers in the United States... [and] the most well known and influential... today remains Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\"\n\nWestern typologies\n\nOrnstein noted that \"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief.\"Robert Ornstein (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, On the Psychology of Meditation. New York: Viking. LCCN 76149720 This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or \"typologies\" are noted here.\n\nProgress on the \"intractable\" problem of defining meditation was attempted by a recent study of views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived) forms of meditation.\"members were chosen on the basis of their publication record of research on the therapeutic use of meditation, their knowledge of and training in traditional or clinically developed meditation techniques, and their affiliation with universities and research centers.. Each member had specific expertise and training in at least one of the following meditation practices: kundalini yoga, Transcendental Meditation, relaxation response, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and vipassana meditation\" (Bond, Ospina et al., 2009, p. 131); their views were combined using \"the Delphi technique... a method of eliciting and refining group judgments to address complex problems with a high level of uncertainty\" (p. 131). The study identified \"three main criteria... as essential to any meditation practice: the use of a defined technique, logic relaxation, and a self-induced state/mode. Other criteria deemed important [but not essential] involve a state of psychophysical relaxation, the use of a self-focus skill or anchor, the presence of a state of suspension of logical thought processes, a religious/spiritual/philosophical context, or a state of mental silence.\" However, the study cautioned, \"It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by 'family resemblances'... or by the related 'prototype' model of concepts.\"The full quotation from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 135) reads: \"It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by 'family resemblances' (Wittgenstein, 1968) or by the related 'prototype' model of concepts (Rosch, 1973; Rosch & Mervin, 1975).\"\n\nIn modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in a variety of ways; many of these emphasize the role of attention.\n\nIn the West, meditation is sometimes thought of in two broad categories: concentrative meditation and mindfulness meditation. These two categories are discussed in the following two paragraphs, with concentrative meditation being used interchangeably with focused attention and mindfulness meditation being used interchangeably with open monitoring:\n\nDirection of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called concentrative meditation), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called mindfulness meditation), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.The full quote from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 130) reads: \"The differences and similarities among these techniques is often explained in the Western meditation literature in terms of the direction of mental attention (Koshikawa & Ichii, 1996; Naranjo, 1971; Orenstein, 1971): A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called concentrative meditation), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called mindfulness meditation), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness (Orenstein, 1971).\"\n\nOne style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object, breathing, image, or words. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment.\n\nOther typologies have also been proposed, and some techniques shift among major categories.\n\nEvidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the categories of meditation, defined by how they direct attention, appear to generate different brainwave patterns. Evidence also suggests that using different focus objects during meditation may generate different brainwave patterns.\n\nMeditation in the workplace\n\nIt is estimated that around a quarter of US employers are using stress reduction initiatives and that the number is growing. Many large companies have introduced mindfulness programs to their employees. In 2010, healthcare benefits company Aetna developed, launched and studied two mindfulness programs, called Viniyoga Stress Reduction and Mindfulness at Work. The goal was to help reduce stress and improve reactions to stress. Aetna now offers its program to its customers. Google also implements mindfulness, offering more than a dozen meditation courses, with the most prominent one, \"Search Inside Yourself\", having been implemented since 2007. General Mills offers the Mindful Leadership Program Series, a course which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, yoga and dialog with the intention of developing the mind's capacity to pay attention.\n\nThe increasing amount of quantifiable research that mindfulness has on the brain and body is one of the major reasons why corporate mindfulness programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that mindfulness meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that mindfulness can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.\n\nAccording to a study on spirituality and performance in organizations, the increase in corporate meditation programs can also be linked to a complex paradigm shift in the structure and system of organizations. The changes in management include a shift from an economic focus to a balance of profits, quality of life, spirituality and social responsibility concerns. For the past 300 years, the mechanical paradigm shaped the economy where the main corporate objectives were to satisfy shareholders by increasing competition and exploitation. The new emerging business paradigm is called the \"Spiritual Movement\" and moves away from a materialistic to a more spiritual orientation. In this new paradigm, a company's competitive advantage resides in how much it invests in its human capital and the qualities of its employees. The shift in business paradigm's can be explained by the fact that the business world is more competitive, globalized and fast-pace than ever. The boundaries between work and home are blurred, where work has become central to people's lives and employees can be connected to their work whenever. The increase in the importance of work has led to an increase in stress and burnout. The workplace is a place where employees spend most of their lives, develop friendships, create value and make meaningful contributions to society. This means that they are looking for satisfaction beyond work. According to a report on emerging cultures, the shift in paradigm can also be explained by American demographics. \"The American adult population is divided into three groups, each with a different set of values and view of the world.\"  The \"Cultural Creatives,\" whom constitute 24% of US adults are the newest and increasingly growing worldview. \"Their values align with ecological sustainability, globalism, women's issues, social conscience, self-actualization and spirituality\". They reflect a major change that has been growing in American culture.\n\nNursing professionals work in a stressful environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses are at high risk for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data analyses revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment.\"  Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.\n\nEmployee turnover rate is a significant problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, turnover rate among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to a substantial number of employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee turnover rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is a significant increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.\n\nForms of meditation\n\nPhysical postures\n\nVarious postures are taken up in some meditation techniques. Sitting, supine, and standing postures are used. Popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism are the full-lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, Seiza, and kneeling positions. Meditation is sometimes done while walking, known as kinhin, or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as samu.\n\nMindfulness\n\nOver the past 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs have become increasingly important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community as a means of helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy.\"In the last 20 years, mindfulness has become the focus of considerable attention for a large community of clinicians and, to a lesser extent, empirical psychology.\" - [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~perlman/0903-EmoPaper/BishopMindfulnessDefinition2004.pdf Mindfulness: A Proposed Operation Definition] Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat.Kabat-Zinn gives the body scan and food meditations in \"Mindfulness for Beginners\" the 2CD set, and Matthieu Ricard gives the letting thoughts arise and pass away in his 2CD set \"Happiness: A Guide to Cultivating Life's Most Important Skill\" Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.\n\nJacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions, especially extreme anxiety.see Progressive muscle relaxation from where these two references were taken showing that this method reduces extreme anxiety, 1)  and 2) \n\nAs a result of the popularity in participation of mindfulness, conferences such as Wisdom 2.0 have arisen. Mindfulness has entered the secular world in many ways, allowing it to reach many different groups of people.\n\nIt has also been shown that mindfulness has resulted in increased antibody titers to the influenza vaccine.\n\nMental silence\n\nSahaja yoga meditation is regarded as a mental silence meditation, and has been shown to correlate with particular brain and brain wave activity. Some studies have led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information. Sahaja meditators scored above peer group for emotional well-being measures on SF-36 ratings.\n\nResearch on meditation\n\nResearch on the processes and effects of meditation is a subfield of neurological research. Modern scientific techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, were used to observe neurological responses during meditation. Since the 1950s, hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the overall methological quality of meditation research is poor, yielding unreliable results. \n\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology and psychiatry have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as reducing depression, stress, and anxiety. Mindfulness is also used in the treatment of drug addiction. Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain. There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight.\n\nA 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on empathy, compassion, and prosocial behaviors found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can \"improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors\".Luberto, C.M., Shinday, N., Song, R. et al. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8 A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Meditation on Empathy, Compassion, and Prosocial Behaviors]. Mindfulness (2017). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8 doi:10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8]\n\nMeditation, religion and drugs\n\nMany major traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, advise members not to consume intoxicants, while others, such as the Rastafarian movements and Native American Church, view drugs as integral to their religious lifestyle.\n\nThe fifth of the five precepts of the Pancasila, the ethical code in the Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist traditions, states that adherents must: \"abstain from fermented and distilled beverages that cause heedlessness.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce altered states of consciousness. In several traditional shamanistic ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the Rastafari movement, cannabis is believed to be a gift from Jah and a sacred herb to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use peyote, as part of religious ceremony, continuing today. In India, the soma drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the Vedas.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as LSD, became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end.\"A Zen Life\" a documentary film about the life of D.T. Suzuki Many practitioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In The Master Game, Robert S de Ropp writes that the \"door to full consciousness\" can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to \"pass beyond the door\" requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as Rick Strassman, believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, \n\nPrevalence of meditation\n\nThe 2012 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (n = 34,525), found 8.0% of US adults used meditation,https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/NHIS/2012/mind-body/meditation, with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively.https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36760 In the 2007 survey meditation use among workers was 9.9% (up from 8.0% in 2002).https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0034.htm\n\nIn popular culture\n\nVarious forms of meditation have been described in popular culture, various religions and the their Ideas of meditation are well highlighted.
