  "textBody" : "Jordanians (Arabic: أردنيون‎), also known as the Jordanian people (Arabic: الشعب الأردني‎ ALA-LC: al-sha‘ab al-ūrdunī) are the citizens of Jordan, who share a common Levantine Semitic ancestry. Some 98% percent of Jordanians are Arabs, while the remaining 2% are other ethnic minorities.  \n\nJordan has a population of approximately 9,531,712 inhabitants (Female: 47%; Males: 53%) as of 2015. Around 2.9 million were non-citizens, a figure including refugees, legal and illegal immigrants. Jordan's annual population growth rate stood at 2.05% in 2017, with an average of three children per woman. There were 1,977,534 households in Jordan in 2015, with an average of 4.8 persons per household. \n\nThe official language is Arabic, while English is the second most widely spoken language by Jordanians. It is also widely used in commerce and government. In 2016, about 84% of Jordan's population live in urban towns and cities. Many Jordanians and people of Jordanian descent live across the world, mainly in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, Sweden and Spain.\n\nIn 2016, Jordan was named as the largest refugee hosting country per capita in the world, followed by Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon. The kingdom of Jordan hosts refugees mainly from Palestine, Syria, Iraq and many other countries. There are also hundreds of thousands of workers from Egypt, Indonesia and South Asia, who work as domestic and construction workers.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe territory of Jordan can be defined by the history of its creation after the end of World War I, the League of Nations and redrawing of the borders of the Eastern Mediterranean littoral. The ensuing decisions, most notably the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which created the Mandatory Palestine. In September 1922, Transjordan was formally identified as a subdivision of the Mandate Palestine after the League of Nations approved the British Transjordan memorandum which stated that the Mandate east of the Jordan River would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement west of the Jordan River.\n\nEthnic and religious groups\n\n \n    \nArab\n\nArab Jordanians are descended from prominent families in the historical cities and towns in Transjordan. Most notably in the governorates of Jerash, Ajlun, Balqa, Irbid, Madaba, Al Karak, Aqaba, Amman and some other towns in the country. Most of the Christian population in the country belongs to this ethnicity or to the Bedouin ethnicity.\n\nBedouin\n\nThe other group of Jordanians is descended from Bedouins (of which, less than 1% live a nomadic lifestyle). Bedouin settlements are concentrated in the wasteland south and east of the country. \n\nArmenians\n\nThere were an estimated 5,000 Armenians living within the country in 2009.[http://i-cias.com/e.o/jordan_4.htm Jordan: Religions & Peoples] An estimated 4,500 of these are members of the Armenian Apostolic Church, and predominantly speak the Western dialect[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=ARM Ethnologue 14 report for language code:ARM] of the Armenian language. This population makes up the majority of non-Arab Christians in the country.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/256321/Religion Jordan :: Religion - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]\n\nAssyrians\n\nThere is an Assyrian refugee population in Jordan. Many Assyrians have arrived in Jordan as refugees since the invasion of Iraq, making up a large part of the Iraqi refugees.\n\nCircassians\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman Authorities directed the Circassian immigrants to settle in Jordan. The Circassians are Sunni Muslims and are estimated to number 20,000 to 80,000 persons.\n\nChechens\n\nThere are about 10,000 Chechens estimated to reside in Jordan.\n\nRefugees \n\nJordan is a home to more than 2 million Palestinians refugees by 2015 who came after the 1948 & 1967 wars, and most of them, but not all, were granted Jordanian citizenship. Jordan also hosts around 1.4 million Syrian refugees who fled to the country due to the Syrian Civil War since 2011. About 31,163 Yemenis and 22,700 Libyan refugees live in Jordan as of January 2015. There are thousands of Lebanese refugees who came to Jordan when civil strife and war and the 2006 war broke out in their native country. Up to 1 million Iraqis came to Jordan following the Iraq War in 2003. In 2015, their number was 130,911. About 2,500 Iraqi Mandaean refugees have been resettled in Jordan.\n\nReligion\n\nHealth and Education\n\nJordan prides itself on its health services, some of the best in the region. Qualified medics, favourable investment climate and Jordan's stability have contributed to the success of this sector.\n\nJordan has a very advanced education system. The school education system comprises 2 years of pre-school education, 10 years of compulsory basic education, and two years of secondary academic or vocational education, after which the students sit for the General Certificate of Secondary Education Exam (Tawjihi). Scholars may attend either private or public schools.\n\nAccess to higher education is open to holders of the General Secondary Education Certificate, who can then choose between private Community Colleges, public Community Colleges or universities (public and private). The credit-hour system, which entitles students to select courses according to a study plan, is implemented at universities. The number of public universities has reached (10), besides (17) universities that are private, and (51) community colleges. Numbers of universities accompanied by significant increase in number of students enrolled to study in these universities, where the number of enrolled students in both public and private universities is estimated at nearly (236) thousand; (28) thousand out of the total are from Arab or foreign nationalities.\n\nStatistics\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nTotal population\n\n10,086,876 (According to the Population Clock as of  February 14, 2018).\n\nGender ratio \n\n* at birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n* 0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n* 15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female \n* 25-54 years: 1 male(s)/female\n* 55-64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n* 65 years and over: 0.89 male(s)/female \n* total population: 1.02 male(s)/female (2016 est.)\n\nAge structure \n\n* 0-14 years: 34.68% (male 1,827,554/female 1,726,691) \n* 15-24 years: 20.07% (male 1,103,042/female 953,704) \n* 25-54 years: 37.36% (male 2,073,211/female 1,755,290)\n* 55-64 years: 4.44% (male 236,435/female 218,469)\n* 65 years and over: 3.45% (male 174,470/female 179,203) (2017 est.)\n\nStructure of the population http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm\n\nStructure of the population (01.10.2004) (Census) \n\nStructure of the population (31.12.2013) (Estimates) (Excluding foreigners, including registered Palestinian):\nrefugees. :\n\nMedian age \n\n* total: 22.5 years\n* male: 22.9 years\n* female: 22 years (2017 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate \n\n2.05% (2017 est.)\n\nBirth rate \n\n23.9 births/1,000 population (2017 est.)\n\nBirths and deaths[http://www.dos.gov.jo/dos_home_a/main/cd_yb2011/Page_details.html Department of Statistics, Jordan]\n\nDeath rate \n\n3.4 deaths/1,000 population (2017 est.)\n\nNet migration rate \n\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2017 est.)\n\nUrbanization \n\nurban population: 84.1% of total population (2017)\nrate of urbanization: 1.26% annual rate of change (2015-20 est.)\n\nMaternal mortality rate \n\n58 deaths/100,000 live births (2015 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth \n\n* total population: 80.18 years\n* male: 78.82 years\n* female: 81.61 years (2012 est.)\n:* total population: 74.8 years\n* male: 73.4 years\n* female: 76.3 years (2017 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate \n\n3.19 children born/woman (2017 est.)\n\nFertility Rate (The Demographic Health Survey) http://www.dhsprogram.com/\nFertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and CBR (Crude Birth Rate):\n\nHealth expenditures \n\n7.5% of GDP (2014)\n\nPhysicians density \n\n2.65 physicians/1,000 population (2014)\n\nHospital bed density \n\n1.8 beds/1,000 population (2012)\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate \n\n35.5% (2016)\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight \n\n3% (2012)\n\nLiteracy rate \n\n15-24 years (in 2015):\n* Total: 99.23%\n* Male: 99.11%\n* Female: 99.37%\n15 years and older (in 2015):\n* Total: 98.01%\n* Male: 98.51%\n* Female: 97.49%\n\nUN estimates[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]",
