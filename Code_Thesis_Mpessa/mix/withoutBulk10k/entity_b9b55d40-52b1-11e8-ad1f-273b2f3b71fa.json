  "textBody" : "Algol, designated Beta Persei (β Persei, abbreviated Beta Per, β Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright multiple star in the constellation of Perseus. It is the first and best known eclipsing binary, and one of the first non-nova variable stars to be discovered. It is a three-star system, consisting of Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab - in which the large and bright primary β Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer β Persei Aa2. Thus, Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days (2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes) during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse (the \"second minimum\") when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically.\n\nAlgol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as Algol variables.\n\nObservation history\n\nAn Ancient Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days composed some 3,200 years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical document of the discovery of Algol.\n\nThe association of Algol with a demon-like creature (Gorgon in the Greek tradition, ghoul in the Arabic tradition) suggests that its variability was known long before the 17th century, but except for the Ancient Egyptian discovery there is still no indisputable evidence for this.G.A. Davis, \"Why did the Arabs Call Beta Persei \"al-Ghul\"?\", Sky and Telescope, 16 (1957), 177 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957S%26T....16..177D ADS]. The Arabic astronomer al-Sufi said nothing about any variability of the star in his Book of Fixed Stars published c.964.\n\nThe variability of Algol was noted in 1667 by Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari,G. Montanari, \"Sopra la sparizione d'alcune stelle et altre novità celesti\", in: Prose de Signori Accademici Gelati di Bologna (Bologna: Manolessi, 1671), pp. 369-92 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TfgLF4-BsqEC Google books]). but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later, when the British amateur astronomer John Goodricke also proposed a mechanism for the star's variability.[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957Obs....77..191E ADS O.J. Eggen,\"An Eighteenth Century Discussion of Algol\", The Observatory, 77 (1957), 191-197]. In May 1783, he presented his findings to the Royal Society, suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star (or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the Earth). For his report he was awarded the Copley Medal.\n\nIn 1881, the Harvard astronomer Edward Charles Pickering presented evidence that Algol was actually an eclipsing binary. This was confirmed a few years later, in 1889, when the Potsdam astronomer Hermann Carl Vogel found periodic doppler shifts in the spectrum of Algol, inferring variations in the radial velocity of this binary system. Thus Algol became one of the first known spectroscopic binaries. Joel Stebbins at the University of Illinois Observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first-ever photoelectric study of a variable star. The light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars.\nSome difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system; four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct.Meltzer, Alan S., A \"Spectroscopic Investigation of Algol\". Astrophysical Journal, vol. 125, (1957), p.359, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...125..359M BibCode:1957ApJ...125..359M]\n\nSystem\n\n  \nFrom the point of view of the Earth, Algol Aa1 and Algol Aa2 form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the  line of sight to the Earth. To be more precise, Algol is a triple-star system: the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0.062 astronomical units (au) from each other, whereas the third star in the system (Algol Ab) is at an average distance of 2.69 au from the pair, and the mutual orbital period of the trio is 681 Earth days. The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of Aa1, Aa2, and Ab are about 4.5 to 1 to 2.\n\nThe three components of the bright triple star used to be, and still sometimes are, referred to as β Per A, B, and C.  The Washington Double Star Catalog lists them as Aa1, Aa2, and An, with two very faint stars B and C about one arcmin distant.  A further five faint stars are also listed as companions.\n\nStudies of Algol led to the Algol paradox in the theory of stellar evolution: although components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars, the more massive component Algol A is still in the main sequence, but the less massive Algol B is a subgiant star at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by mass transfer: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its Roche lobe, and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can be seen.\n\nThis system also exhibits x-ray and radio wave flares. The x-ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the A and B components interacting with the mass transfer. The radio-wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of sunspots, but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the Sun, these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent.\n\nMagnetic activity cycles in the chromospherically active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of  ≈ 10−5 via the Applegate mechanism. Mass transfer between the components is small in the Algol system but could be a significant source of period change in other Algol-type binaries.\n\nAlgol is about 92.8 light-years from the Sun, but about 7.3 million years ago it passed within 9.8 light-years of the Solar System and its apparent magnitude was about −2.5, which is considerably brighter than the star Sirius is today. Because the total mass of the Algol system is about 5.8 solar masses, at the closest approach this might have given enough gravity to perturb the Oort cloud of the Solar System somewhat and hence increase the number of comets entering the inner Solar System. However, the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small.\n\nNames\n\nBeta Persei is the star's Bayer designation. The name Algol derives from Arabic  raʾs al-ghūl : head (raʾs) of the ogre (al-ghūl) (see \"ghoul\").P. Kunitzsch & T. Smart, Short Guide to Modern Star Names and Their Derivations (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1986), p 49. The English name \"Demon Star\" is a direct translation of this. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Algol for this star. It is so entered on the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nIn Hebrew folklore, Algol was called Rōsh ha Sāṭān or \"Satan's Head\", as stated by Edmund Chilmead, who called it \"Divels head\" or Rosch hassatan. A Latin name for Algol from the 16th century was Caput Larvae or \"the Spectre's Head\". Hipparchus and Pliny made this a separate, though connected, constellation.\n\nIn Chinese,  (), meaning Mausoleum, refers to an asterism consisting of β Persei, 9 Persei, τ Persei, ι Persei, κ Persei, ρ Persei, 16 Persei and 12 Persei. Consequently, β Persei itself is known as  (, English: The Fifth Star of Mausoleum.).

In the Tetrabiblos, the 2nd-century astrological text of the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, Algol is referred to as \"the Gorgon of Perseus\" and associated with death by decapitation: a theme which mirrors the myth of the hero Perseus's victory over the snake-haired Gorgon Medusa.Robbins, Frank E. (ed.) 1940. Ptolemy: Tetrabiblos. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (Loeb Classical Library). , IV.9, p.435.
