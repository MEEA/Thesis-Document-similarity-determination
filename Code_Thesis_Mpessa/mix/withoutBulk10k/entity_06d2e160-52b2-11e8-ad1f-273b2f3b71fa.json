  "textBody" : "Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\n\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length.Metal: The Definitive Guide (Garry Sharpe-Young), US Death Metal and Grindcore British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"You Suffer\" (1987). Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.\n\nA variety of microgenres have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nGrindcore evolved as a blend of thrash metal and hardcore punk.  The name derives from the fact that grind is a British term for thrash; that term was appended to -core from hardcore.  Grindcore relies on standard hardcore punk instrumentation: electric guitar, bass and drums. However, grindcore alters the usual practices of metal or rock music in regard to song structure and tone. The vocal style is \"ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks.\" In some cases, no clear lyrics exist. Vocals may be used as merely an added sound effect, a common practice with bands such as the experimental Naked City.\n\nA characteristic of some grindcore songs is the \"microsong,\" lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the Guinness Book of World Records awarded Brutal Truth the record for \"Shortest Music Video\" for 1994's \"Collateral Damage\" (the song lasts four seconds). In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song \"You Suffer\" set a new \"Shortest Music Video\" record: 1.3 seconds. Beyond the microsong, it is characteristic of grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, Carcass' debut album Reek of Putrefaction (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is also not uncommon for grindcore albums to be very short when compared to other genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nMany grindcore groups experiment with down-tuned guitars. While the vinyl A-side of Napalm Death's debut, 1987's Scum, is set to standard tuning, on side B, the guitars are tuned down 2½ steps. Their second album From Enslavement to Obliteration and the Mentally Murdered EP were tuned to C♯. Harmony Corruption, their third full-length album, was tuned up to a D. Bolt Thrower went  further, dropping 3½ steps down (A).Johnson 2007, page 04. Bass is tuned low as well, and is often distorted.\n\nBlast beat \n\nThe blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms,Adam MacGregor, Agoraphobic Nosebleed review, Dusted, June 11, 2006. [http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2945] Access date: October 2, 2008. although its usage predates the genre itself, as it is native to jazz. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\" Blast beats have been described as \"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per second than sheer sonic violence.\"Strub, Whitney. [http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/napalm-death-060511.shtml \"Behind the Key Club: An Interview with Mark 'Barney' Greenway of Napalm Death\"]. PopMatters, May 11, 2006. Retrieved September 17, 2008. Napalm Death coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo.Ekeroth, p. 22. D.R.I. (\"No Sense\"), S.O.D. (\"Milk\"),Stormtroopers of Death, 1985, track 11. Sarcófago (\"Satanas\"),Sarcófago, Sepultura (\"Antichrist\"),Sepultura, 1986, track 10. and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.\n\nLyrical themes \n\nGrindcore lyrics are typically provocative. A number of grindcore musicians are committed to political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots.\"Grindcore Special,\" p. 46. For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, in the tradition of anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Other grindcore groups, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans.Carcass biography. NME.com. [http://www.nme.com/artists/carcass] Access date: April 25, 2009. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to \"bodily\" themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam's lyrics are notorious for their black comedy,Eduardo Rivadavia, Anal Cunt bio, Allmusic. [] Access date: April 25, 2009. while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' cut-up method.\n\nHistory \n\nPrecursors \n\nThe early grindcore scene relied on an international network of tape trading and DIY production.\"Grindcore Special\", p. 44. The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are Siege,Steven Blush, \"Boston Not L.A.\", American Hardcore, Feral House, p. 171. a hardcore punk group, and Repulsion, an early death metal outfit.Matthew Widener, \"Scared to Death: The Making of Repulsion's Horrified\", Decibel no. 46, August 2008, p. 63-69.\nSiege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were influenced by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Motörhead.Mudrian 2004, p. 50. Siege's goal was maximum velocity: \"We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, 'Okay, we're gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them, drummer Robert Williams recalled.\n\nRepulsion is often credited with inventing the classic grind blast beat (played at 190 bpm), as well as its distinctive bass tone. Shane Embury, in particular, advocates the band as the origin of Napalm Death's later innovations. Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth declares that \"Horrified was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion.\"\"Grindcore Special\", p. 41.\n\nOther groups in the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have emphasized the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat.\"Grindcore Special,\" p. 43. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer,\"Grindcore Special\", p. 45. and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style.\"Grindcore Special\", p. 52. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge,\"Dark Recollections: Napalm Death, Scum,\" Terrorizer, issue 183, May 2009, p. 84-85 Amebix, Throbbing Gristle,Mudrian 2004, page 31. and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division,Interview with Mick Harris, DVD half of Napalm Death's Scum 20 year anniversary reissue. was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.\n\nBritish grindcore \n\nGrindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the anarcho-punk scene in Birmingham, England.Glasper 2009, p. 11 While their first recordings were in the vein of Crass, they eventually became associated with crust punk.\"Crustgrind\", \"Grindcore Special\" part 2, p. 46 The group began to take on increasing elements of thrashcore, post-punk, and power electronics.Glasper 2009, p. 12 The group also went through many changes in personnel.Glasper 2009, p. 14 A major shift in style took place after Mick Harris became the group's drummer. Punk historian Ian Glasper indicates that \"For several months gob-smacked audiences weren't sure whether Napalm Death were actually a serious band any longer, such was the undeniable novelty of their hyper-speed new drummer.\" Albert Mudrian's research suggests that the name \"grindcore\" was coined by Harris. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said:\n\nOther sources contradict Harris' claim. In a Spin magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that \"the man often credited\" for dubbing the style grindcore was Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore \"sound\" came to be:\n\nEarache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death \"put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.\"Blush 1991, page 35 Pearson, however, said that grindcore \"wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.\" He claimed that \"it actually was coined to describe the guitars - heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.\"\n\nWhile abrasive, grindcore achieved a measure of mainstream visibility. New Musical Express featured Napalm Death on their cover in 1988, declaring them \"the fastest band in the world.\"Glasper 2009, p. 22 As James Hoare, deputy editor of Terrorizer, writes:\n\nNapalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.Felix von Havoc, Maximum Rock'n'Roll #198.  Archived by Havoc Records. Access date: June 20, 2008. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984.Glasper 2009, p. 273 With the goal of becoming \"the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time,\"Dean Jones, quoted in Glasper 2009, p. 273 the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987.Glasper 2009, p. 275 Ian Glasper describes the group as \"pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [vocalists] Dean [Jones] and Phil [Vane] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit.\" In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992.Glasper 2009, p. 277 Carcass released Reek of Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite album of the year despite its very poor production.Mudrian 2004, p. 132 The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken \"perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance\"Glasper 2009, p. 237 were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music.Glasper 2009, p. 238 Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.Glasper 2009, p. 502\n\nIn the subsequent decade, two pioneers of the style became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's \"Twist the Knife (Slowly)\" on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum in less than a year. The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding the subsequent popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: \"'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.\"Glasper 2009, 279 Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that \"Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme.\"Glasper 2009, p. 25\n\nNorth American grindcore \n\nJournalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, the American precursors, and death metal.Kevin Stewart-Panko, \"Altered States,\" \"Grindcore Special\" part 2, p. 42-43. As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works, such as Harmony Corruption. American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal. Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Assück. Anal Cunt, a particularly dissonant group who lacked a bass player, were also particularly influential. Their style was sometimes referred to as \"noisecore\" or \"noisegrind\", described by Giulio of Cripple Bastards as \"the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time.\" Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.\n\nHowever, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of Dark Angel than the British groups. Discordance Axis had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style. Scott Hull is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. ANb's Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope has been described as \"the Paul's Boutique of grindcore\", by Village Voice critic Phil Freeman, for its \"hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants.\"Phil Freeman, \"Gratuitous Grindcore Gross-Out Gimps' Glade and Guns Get Guffaws\", Village Voice, September 13, 2005.

In Los Angeles, Hole also initially drew influence from grindcore in their early releases, particularly on their singles \"Dicknail\" and \"Teenage Whore\", as well as on their debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), all of which featured sexually provocative and violent lyrics, as well as the heavy distortion and fluctuating tempo that distinguished the genre. Frontwoman Courtney Love stated that she wanted to capture the distinguishing elements of grindcore while incorporating more pop-based melodic structure, although the band distanced themselves from the style in their later releases.\n\nOther later prominent grindcore groups of North America include Brujeria,Jason Birchmeier, Matando Güeros review, Allmusic.

Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.\n\nPowerviolence \n\nPowerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk.\"Powerviolence: The Dysfunctional Family of Bllleeeeaaauuurrrgghhh!!\".

The style is closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.\n\nPowerviolence bands focus on speed, brevity, bizarre timing breakdowns, and constant tempo changes. Powerviolence songs are often very short; it is not uncommon for some to last less than 30 seconds. Some groups, particularly Man Is the Bastard, took influence from sludge metal and noise music. Lyrically and conceptually, powerviolence groups were very raw and underproduced, both sonically and in their packaging. Some groups  (Man Is the Bastard and Dropdead) took influence from anarcho-punk and crust punk, emphasizing animal rights and anti-militarism.

Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\n\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length.Metal: The Definitive Guide (Garry Sharpe-Young), US Death Metal and Grindcore British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"You Suffer\" (1987). Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.\n\nA variety of microgenres have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nGrindcore evolved as a blend of thrash metal and hardcore punk.  The name derives from the fact that grind is a British term for thrash; that term was appended to -core from hardcore.  Grindcore relies on standard hardcore punk instrumentation: electric guitar, bass and drums. However, grindcore alters the usual practices of metal or rock music in regard to song structure and tone. The vocal style is \"ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks.\" In some cases, no clear lyrics exist. Vocals may be used as merely an added sound effect, a common practice with bands such as the experimental Naked City.\n\nA characteristic of some grindcore songs is the \"microsong,\" lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the Guinness Book of World Records awarded Brutal Truth the record for \"Shortest Music Video\" for 1994's \"Collateral Damage\" (the song lasts four seconds). In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song \"You Suffer\" set a new \"Shortest Music Video\" record: 1.3 seconds. Beyond the microsong, it is characteristic of grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, Carcass' debut album Reek of Putrefaction (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is also not uncommon for grindcore albums to be very short when compared to other genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nMany grindcore groups experiment with down-tuned guitars. While the vinyl A-side of Napalm Death's debut, 1987's Scum, is set to standard tuning, on side B, the guitars are tuned down 2½ steps. Their second album From Enslavement to Obliteration and the Mentally Murdered EP were tuned to C♯. Harmony Corruption, their third full-length album, was tuned up to a D. Bolt Thrower went  further, dropping 3½ steps down (A).Johnson 2007, page 04. Bass is tuned low as well, and is often distorted.\n\nBlast beat \n\nThe blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms,Adam MacGregor, Agoraphobic Nosebleed review, Dusted, June 11, 2006. [http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2945] Access date: October 2, 2008. although its usage predates the genre itself, as it is native to jazz. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\" Blast beats have been described as \"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per second than sheer sonic violence.\"Strub, Whitney. [http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/napalm-death-060511.shtml \"Behind the Key Club: An Interview with Mark 'Barney' Greenway of Napalm Death\"]. PopMatters, May 11, 2006. Retrieved September 17, 2008. Napalm Death coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo.Ekeroth, p. 22. D.R.I. (\"No Sense\"), S.O.D. (\"Milk\"),Stormtroopers of Death, 1985, track 11. Sarcófago (\"Satanas\"),Sarcófago, Sepultura (\"Antichrist\"),Sepultura, 1986, track 10. and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.\n\nLyrical themes \n\nGrindcore lyrics are typically provocative. A number of grindcore musicians are committed to political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots.\"Grindcore Special,\" p. 46. For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, in the tradition of anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Other grindcore groups, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans.Carcass biography. NME.com. [http://www.nme.com/artists/carcass] Access date: April 25, 2009. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to \"bodily\" themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam's lyrics are notorious for their black comedy,Eduardo Rivadavia, Anal Cunt bio, Allmusic. [] Access date: April 25, 2009. while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' cut-up method.\n\nHistory \n\nPrecursors \n\nThe early grindcore scene relied on an international network of tape trading and DIY production.\"Grindcore Special\", p. 44. The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are Siege,Steven Blush, \"Boston Not L.A.\", American Hardcore, Feral House, p. 171. a hardcore punk group, and Repulsion, an early death metal outfit.Matthew Widener, \"Scared to Death: The Making of Repulsion's Horrified\", Decibel no. 46, August 2008, p. 63-69.\nSiege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were influenced by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Motörhead.Mudrian 2004, p. 50. Siege's goal was maximum velocity: \"We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, 'Okay, we're gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them, drummer Robert Williams recalled.\n\nRepulsion is often credited with inventing the classic grind blast beat (played at 190 bpm), as well as its distinctive bass tone. Shane Embury, in particular, advocates the band as the origin of Napalm Death's later innovations. Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth declares that \"Horrified was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion.\"\"Grindcore Special\", p. 41.\n\nOther groups in the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have emphasized the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat.\"Grindcore Special,\" p. 43. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer,\"Grindcore Special\", p. 45. and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style.\"Grindcore Special\", p. 52. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge,\"Dark Recollections: Napalm Death, Scum,\" Terrorizer, issue 183, May 2009, p. 84-85 Amebix, Throbbing Gristle,Mudrian 2004, page 31. and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division,Interview with Mick Harris, DVD half of Napalm Death's Scum 20 year anniversary reissue. was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.\n\nBritish grindcore \n\nGrindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the anarcho-punk scene in Birmingham, England.Glasper 2009, p. 11 While their first recordings were in the vein of Crass, they eventually became associated with crust punk.\"Crustgrind\", \"Grindcore Special\" part 2, p. 46 The group began to take on increasing elements of thrashcore, post-punk, and power electronics.Glasper 2009, p. 12 The group also went through many changes in personnel.Glasper 2009, p. 14 A major shift in style took place after Mick Harris became the group's drummer. Punk historian Ian Glasper indicates that \"For several months gob-smacked audiences weren't sure whether Napalm Death were actually a serious band any longer, such was the undeniable novelty of their hyper-speed new drummer.\" Albert Mudrian's research suggests that the name \"grindcore\" was coined by Harris. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said:\n\nOther sources contradict Harris' claim. In a Spin magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that \"the man often credited\" for dubbing the style grindcore was Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore \"sound\" came to be:\n\nEarache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death \"put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.\"Blush 1991, page 35 Pearson, however, said that grindcore \"wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.\" He claimed that \"it actually was coined to describe the guitars - heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.\"\n\nWhile abrasive, grindcore achieved a measure of mainstream visibility. New Musical Express featured Napalm Death on their cover in 1988, declaring them \"the fastest band in the world.\"Glasper 2009, p. 22 As James Hoare, deputy editor of Terrorizer, writes:\n\nNapalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.Felix von Havoc, Maximum Rock'n'Roll #198.  Archived by Havoc Records. Access date: June 20, 2008. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984.Glasper 2009, p. 273 With the goal of becoming \"the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time,\"Dean Jones, quoted in Glasper 2009, p. 273 the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987.Glasper 2009, p. 275 Ian Glasper describes the group as \"pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [vocalists] Dean [Jones] and Phil [Vane] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit.\" In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992.Glasper 2009, p. 277 Carcass released Reek of Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite album of the year despite its very poor production.Mudrian 2004, p. 132 The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken \"perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance\"Glasper 2009, p. 237 were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music.Glasper 2009, p. 238 Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.Glasper 2009, p. 502\n\nIn the subsequent decade, two pioneers of the style became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's \"Twist the Knife (Slowly)\" on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum in less than a year. The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding the subsequent popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: \"'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.\"Glasper 2009, 279 Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that \"Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme.\"Glasper 2009, p. 25\n\nNorth American grindcore \n\nJournalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, the American precursors, and death metal.Kevin Stewart-Panko, \"Altered States,\" \"Grindcore Special\" part 2, p. 42-43. As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works, such as Harmony Corruption. American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal. Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Assück. Anal Cunt, a particularly dissonant group who lacked a bass player, were also particularly influential. Their style was sometimes referred to as \"noisecore\" or \"noisegrind\", described by Giulio of Cripple Bastards as \"the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time.\" Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.\n\nHowever, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of Dark Angel than the British groups. Discordance Axis had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style. Scott Hull is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. ANb's Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope has been described as \"the Paul's Boutique of grindcore\", by Village Voice critic Phil Freeman, for its \"hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants.\"Phil Freeman, \"Gratuitous Grindcore Gross-Out Gimps' Glade and Guns Get Guffaws\", Village Voice, September 13, 2005.

In Los Angeles, Hole also initially drew influence from grindcore in their early releases, particularly on their singles \"Dicknail\" and \"Teenage Whore\", as well as on their debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), all of which featured sexually provocative and violent lyrics, as well as the heavy distortion and fluctuating tempo that distinguished the genre. Frontwoman Courtney Love stated that she wanted to capture the distinguishing elements of grindcore while incorporating more pop-based melodic structure, although the band distanced themselves from the style in their later releases.\n\nOther later prominent grindcore groups of North America include Brujeria,Jason Birchmeier, Matando Güeros review, Allmusic.

Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.\n\nPowerviolence \n\nPowerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk.\"Powerviolence: The Dysfunctional Family of Bllleeeeaaauuurrrgghhh!!\".

The style is closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.\n\nPowerviolence bands focus on speed, brevity, bizarre timing breakdowns, and constant tempo changes. Powerviolence songs are often very short; it is not uncommon for some to last less than 30 seconds. Some groups, particularly Man Is the Bastard, took influence from sludge metal and noise music. Lyrically and conceptually, powerviolence groups were very raw and underproduced, both sonically and in their packaging. Some groups  (Man Is the Bastard and Dropdead) took influence from anarcho-punk and crust punk, emphasizing animal rights and anti-militarism.
