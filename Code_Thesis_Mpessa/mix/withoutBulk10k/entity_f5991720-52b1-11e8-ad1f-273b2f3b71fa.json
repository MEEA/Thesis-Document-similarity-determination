  "textBody" : "Esperanto is a constructed language. Due to its highly regular grammar, it is often said that Esperanto is easier to learn than other languages. \n\nEach part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ‑o; adjectives with ‑a; present‑tense indicative verbs with ‑as, and so on.\n\nIt is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 \"meaning words\", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.\n\nReference grammars include the Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo) () by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien, and the Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko () by Bertilo Wennergren.\n\nGrammatical summary\n\nEsperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the indicative has three tenses, and are derived for several aspects, but do not agree with the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects information flow and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nScript and pronunciation\n\nEsperanto uses the Latin alphabet with six additional lettersĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭand does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.\n\nZamenhof suggested Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation.\n\nThe article\n\nEsperanto has a single definite article, la, which is invariable. It is similar to English \"the\".\n\nLa is used:\n\nFor identifiable, countable objects:\n:Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.\n::\"I found a bottle and took off the lid.\"\nFor representative individuals:\n:La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.\n::\"The cheetah is the fastest of the animals.\"\n:La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi.\n::\"Bees have fur, but they're no good for petting.\"\nFor adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:\n:la blua\n:: \"the blue one\"\n:la angla\n:: \"English\" (i.e. \"the English language\")\nFor possessive pronouns, when definite:\n:La mia bluas, la via ruĝas.\n::\"Mine is blue, yours is red\".\n\nThe article is also used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a possessive adjective:\nIli tranĉis la manon.\n:\"They cut their hands.\" [one hand each]\n\nThe article la, like the demonstrative adjective tiu (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the noun phrase.\n\nThere is no grammatically required indefinite article: homo means either \"human being\" or \"a human being\", depending on the context, and similarly the plural homoj means \"human beings\" or \"some human beings\". The words iu and unu (or their plurals iuj and unuj) may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to \"some\" and \"a certain\" than to English \"a\". This use of unu corresponds to English \"a\" when the \"a\" indicates a specific individual.Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#specifa 'La artikolo'], in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo\n\nParts of speech\n\nThe suffixes ‑o, ‑a, ‑e, and ‑i indicate that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word vidi (to see) are vida (visual), vide (visually), and vido (vision).\n\nEach root word has an inherent part of speech: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix ‑o indicates an abstraction: parolo (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root paroli (to speak); belo (beauty) from the adjectival root bela (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ‑a: reĝa (royal), from the nominal root reĝo (a king); parola (spoken). The various verbal endings mean to be [__] when added to an adjectival root: beli (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean \"to act as\" the noun, \"to use\" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: reĝi (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in -e are derived: bele (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a prepositional phrase: parole (by speech, orally); vide (by sight, visually); reĝe (like a king, royally).\n\nThe meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry broso), whereas kombi (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under kombi). Change the suffix to -o, and the similar meanings of brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.\n\nA limited number of basic adverbs do not end with -e, but with an undefined part-of-speech ending -aŭ. Not all words ending in -aŭ are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in -aŭ have other functions, such as hodiaŭ \"today\" [noun or adverb] or ankoraŭ \"yet, still\" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as nun \"now\", tro \"too, too much\", not counting the adverbs among the correlatives. (See special Esperanto adverbs.)\n\nOther parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions (al \"to\"), conjunctions (kaj \"and\"), interjections (ho \"oh\"), numerals (du \"two\"), and pronouns (mi \"I\"—The final -i found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical \"particles\" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ne (not), ankaŭ (also), nur (only), eĉ (even).\n\nNouns and adjectives\n\nA suffix -j following the noun or adjective suffixes -o or -a makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a countable noun is understood to be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix -n, which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence -ojn rhymes with English coin, and -ajn rhymes with fine.)\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they modify are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in subject–object–verb or verb–subject–object clauses:\n\nla knabino feliĉan knabon kisis (the girl kissed a happy boy)\nla knabino feliĉa knabon kisis (the happy girl kissed a boy).\n\nAgreement clarifies the syntax in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:\nruĝaj domo kaj aŭto (a red house and [a red] car)\nruĝa domo kaj aŭto (a red house and a car).\n\nA predicative adjective does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:\nmi farbis la pordon ruĝan (I painted the red door)\nmi farbis la pordon ruĝa (I painted the door red).\n\nPronouns\n\nThere are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal (vi \"you plural\"), demonstrative (tio \"that\", iu \"someone\"), and relative/interrogative (kio \"what\").\nAccording to the fifth rulehttp://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html of the Fundamento de Esperanto:\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nThe Esperanto personal pronoun system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a reflexive pronoun.\n\n Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun ci to be used in translations from languages where the T–V distinction is important, and added it in the Dua Libro in 1888 clarifying that \"this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used\". It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didn't include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the Fundamento and in his 28th Lingva Respondo, published in 1908, recommended to use only vi. The normal usage is to use vi regardless of number or formality. However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ci in practical speech.\n\nPersonal pronouns take the accusative suffix -n as nouns do: min (me), lin (him), ŝin (her). Possessive adjectives are formed with the adjectival suffix -a: mia (my), ĝia (its), nia (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: ni salutis liajn amikojn (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: la mia (mine).\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer to back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:\nli lavis sin \"he washed\" (himself)\nili lavis sin \"they washed\" (themselves or each other)\nli lavis lin \"he washed him\" (someone else)\nli manĝis sian panon \"he ate his bread\" (his own bread)\nli manĝis lian panon \"he ate his bread\" (someone else's bread).\n\nThe indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject it with a passive verb,\noni diras, ke ... \"One says that...\", meaning: \"they say that ...\" or \"it's said that ...\"\nWith \"impersonal\" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:\npluvas \"rains; is raining; it's raining\".\n\nThe rain is falling by itself, therefore \"it\" doesn't get used.\n\nĜi (\"it\"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an epicene (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, Aŭgusto However, this proposal is not generally accepted.\n\nIn popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:\nLa infano estas ploranta, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi \"the child is crying, because it wants to eat\".\nWhen speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun tiu (\"that thing or person that is already known to the listener\") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence\nIu ĵus diris, ke tiu malsatas \"Someone just said that that thing/person is hungry\",\nthe word tiu would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns this or that but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of ĝi, li or ŝi.\n\nOther pronouns\n\nThe demonstrative and relative pronouns form part of the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in -o (simple pronouns) and -u (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in -n, but the genitive case ends in -es, which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases lia domo (his house) and ties domo (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural liaj domoj (his houses) and ties domoj (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive lian domon and ties domon.An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition na has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun (ties, accusative na ties). The purposefully ambiguous preposition je may be so used as well (accusative je ties), though normally the -es words are simply not inflected for case.\n\nPrepositions\n\nAlthough Esperanto word order is fairly free, prepositions must come at the beginning of a noun phrase. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various cases (accusative, dative, and so on), in Esperanto all prepositions govern the nominative: por Johano (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is replaced by the accusative.\n\nPrepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition je should be used:\nili iros je la tria de majo (they'll go on the third of May: the \"on\" isn't literally true).\n\nAlternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:\nili iros la trian de majo.\n\nNote that although la trian (the third) is in the accusative, de majo (of May) is still a prepositional phrase, and so the noun majo remains in the nominative case.\n\nA frequent use of the accusative is in place of al (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion (allative construction). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:\nla kato ĉasis la muson en la domo (the cat chased the mouse in [inside of] the house)\nla kato ĉasis la muson en la domon (the cat chased the mouse into the house).\n\nThe accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:\nli iris al sia hejmo (he went to his home)\nli iris hejmen (he went home)\n\nBoth por and pro often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish for a goal (looking forward in time, or causing: por) and for a cause (looking back in time, or being caused by: pro): To vote por your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote pro your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.\n\nThe preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps de, which corresponds to English of, from, off, and (done) by:\nlibro de Johano (John's book)\nli venis de la butiko (he came from the shop)\nmordita de hundo (bitten by a dog)\n\nHowever, English of corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: de, el (out of, made of), and da (quantity of, unity of form and contents):\ntablo el ligno (a table of wood)\nglaso da vino (a glass of wine)\nlisto da kondiĉoj de la kandidatoj (a list of conditions from the candidates)\nThe last of these, da, is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.Sergio Pokrovskij, 2007. \"[http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#Da La artikolo]\", in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo.See the entry for da at Wiktionary.\n\nOccasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare root may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) we get the preposition far (done by).\n\nVerbs\n\nAll verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the indicative mood. The other moods are the infinitive, conditional, and jussive. No aspectual distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of Aktionsart are common.\n\nVerbs do not change form according to their subject. I am, we are, and he is are simply mi estas, ni estas, and li estas, respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: pluvas (it is raining); estas muso en la domo (there's a mouse in the house).\n\nMost verbs are inherently transitive or intransitive. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes -ig- (the transitivizer/causative) and -iĝ- (the intransitivizer/middle voice):\nakvo bolas je cent gradoj (water boils at 100 degrees)\nni boligas la akvon (we boil the water).\n\nThe verbal paradigm\n\nThe tenses have characteristic vowels. A indicates the present tense, i the past, and o the future.\n\nThe verbal forms may be illustrated with the root esper- (hope):\nesperi (to hope)\nesperas (hopes, is hoping)\nesperis (hoped, was hoping)\nesperos (shall hope, will hope)\nesperu (hope!; a command)\nesperus (were to hope, would hope)\n\nA verb can be made emphatic with the particle ja (indeed): mi ja esperas (I do hope), mi ja esperis (I did hope).\n\nTense\n\nAs in English, Esperanto present tense may be used for generic statements such as \"birds fly\" (la birdoj flugas).\n\nThe Esperanto future is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English \"(I'll give it to you) when I see you\" the verb \"see\" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: (Mi donos ĝin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin.\n\nEsperanto tense is relative. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a subordinate verb is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, \"John said that he would go\" is in Esperanto Johano diris, ke li iros (lit., \"John said that he will go\"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as \"John said that he will go\" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.\n\nMood\n\nThe conditional mood is used for such expressions as se mi povus, mi irus (if I could, I would go) and se mi estus vi, mi irus (if I were you, I'd go).\n\nThe jussive mood, is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the imperative and subjunctive:\nIru! (Go!)\nMi petis, ke li venu. (I asked him to come.)\nLi parolu. (Let him speak.)\nNi iru. (Let's go.)\nBenu ĉi tiun domaĉon. (Bless this bad house.)\nMia filino belu! (May my daughter be beautiful!)\n\nCopula\n\nThe verb esti (to be) is both the copula (\"X is Y\") and the existential (\"there is\") verb. As a copula linking two noun phrases, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with esti can be semantically important: compare hundoj estas personoj (dogs are people) and personoj estas hundoj (people are dogs).\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common to replace esti-plus-adjective with a verb: la ĉielo estas blua or la ĉielo bluas (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: Morti (to die) does not have the same meaning as esti morta (to be dead).\n\nParticiples\n\nParticiples are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:\n* three aspects: past (or \"perfective\"), present (or \"progressive\"), and future (or \"predictive\")\ntimes\n* two voices: active (performing an action) and passive (receiving an action)\nThe participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: i, a, o. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing voice, with either nt or t following the vowel (see next section).\n\nAdjectival participles\n\nThe basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb fali (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are falonta (about to fall). As they drop, they are falanta (falling). After they hit the ground, they are falinta (fallen).\n\nActive and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb haki (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is hakonta (about to chop) and the tree is hakota (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is hakanta (chopping) and the tree hakata (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is hakinta (having chopped) and the tree hakita (chopped).\n\nAdjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:\nili ŝparis la arbojn hakotajn (they spared the trees [that were] to be chopped down).\n\nCompound tense\n\nCompound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus esti (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:\n*Present progressive: mi estas kaptanta (I am catching [something]), mi estas kaptata (I am being caught)\n*Present perfect: mi estas kaptinta (I have caught [something]), mi estas kaptita (I have been caught, I am caught)\n*Present prospective: mi estas kaptonta (I am going to catch / about to catch), mi estas kaptota (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)\n\nThese are not used as often as their English equivalents. For \"I am going to the store\", you would normally use the simple present mi iras in Esperanto.\n\nThe tense and mood of esti can be changed in these compound tenses:\nmi estis kaptinta (I had caught)\nmi estus kaptonta (I would be about to catch)\nmi estos kaptanta (I will be catching).\n\nAlthough such periphrastic constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [esti + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:\n\nmi estas kaptinta or mi kaptintas (I have caught)\nmi estis kaptinta or mi kaptintis (I had caught)\n\nThe active synthetic forms are:\n\nInfinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably -intus and -atas, entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.Bertilo Wennergren, Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko, [http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/participoj/kunmetitaj_verboformoj/nekutimaj.html Nekutimaj kunmetitaj verboj]\n\nNominal participles\n\nParticiples may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix -a with -e or -o. This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.\n\nA nominal participle indicates one who participates in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, esperinto is a \"hoper\" (past tense), or one who had been hoping.\n\nAdverbial participles\n\nAdverbial participles are used with subjectless clauses:\nKaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen (Having caught the ball, he ran for the goal).\n\nConditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)\n\nOccasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel u (-unt-, -ut-).Timothy Reagan (2009) Language Matters: Reflections on Educational Linguistics, p. 167 If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be hakunta and the tree hakuta (he, the one \"who would chop\", and the tree, the one that \"would be chopped\").\n\nThis can also be illustrated with the verb prezidi (to preside). Just after the recount of the 2000 United States presidential election:\n*then-president Bill Clinton was still prezidanto (current president) of the United States,\n*president-elect George W. Bush was declared prezidonto (president-to-be),\n*the previous president George H. W. Bush was a prezidinto (former president), and\n*the contending candidate Al Gore was prezidunto (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for 'president' (of a country) is the tense-neutral word prezidento. Prezidanto is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and prezidinto is used for former presidents in such contexts.\n\nThe tense-neutral word prezidento is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb prezidi.\n\nNegation\n\nA statement is made negative by using ne or one of the negative (neni-) correlatives. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:\n\nMi ne faris ion ajn. I didn't do anything.\n\nTwo negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.\n\nMi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion. It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.\n\nThe word ne comes before the word it negates:\nMi ne skribis tion (I didn't write that)\nNe mi skribis tion (It wasn't I who wrote that)\nMi skribis ne tion (It wasn't that that I wrote)\n\nThe latter will frequently be reordered as ne tion mi skribis depending on the flow of information.\n\nQuestions\n\n\"Wh\" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative (ki-) correlatives. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:\n\nLi scias, kion vi faris (He knows what you did.)\nKion vi faris? (What did you do?)\nVi faris kion? (You did what?)\n\nYes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ĉu (whether):\n\nMi ne scias, ĉu li venos (I don't know whether he'll come)\nĈu li venos? (Will he come?)\n\nSuch questions can be answered jes (yes) or ne (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ĝuste (correct) or malĝuste (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:\n\nĈu vi ne iris? (Did you not go?)\n— Ne, mi ne iris (No, I didn't go); — Jes, mi iris (Yes, I went)\n— Ĝuste, mi ne iris (Correct, I didn't go); — Malĝuste, mi iris (Incorrect, I did go)\n\nNote that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.\n\nConjunctions\n\nBasic Esperanto conjunctions are kaj (both/and), aŭ (either/or), nek (neither/nor), se (if), ĉu (whether/or), sed (but), anstataŭ (instead of), krom (besides, in addition to), kiel (like, as), ke (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:\n\nMi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon (I saw both him and his friend)\nEstis nek hele nek agrable (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)\nĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo (whether by whim, or by natural language development)\nLi volus, ke ni iru (he would like us to go)\n\nHowever, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from Don Harlow:\n\nLi traktis min kiel princon (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)\nLi traktis min kiel princo (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)\n\nInterjections\n\nInterjections may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ek! (get going!), from the perfective prefix; um (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; fek! (shit!), from feki (to defecate).\n\nWord formation\n\nEsperanto derivational morphology uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.\n\nNumbers\n\nNumerals\n\nThe cardinal numerals are:\n\nnul (zero)\nunu (one)\ndu (two)\ntri (three)\nkvar (four)\nkvin (five)\nses (six)\nsep (seven)\nok (eight)\nnaŭ (nine)\ndek (ten)\ncent (one hundred)\nmil (one thousand)\n\nThese are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, unu (and only unu) is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning \"a certain\", and in such cases it may take the plural affix -j, just as the demonstrative pronoun tiu does:\nunuj homoj\n\"certain people\";\nili kuris unuj post la aliaj\n\"they ran some after others\".\nIn such use unu is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix -n in the singular, but does in the plural:\nian unu ideon\n\"some particular idea\",\nbut\nunuj objektoj venis en unujn manojn, aliaj en aliajn manojn\n\"some objects come into certain hands, others into other hands\".\nAdditionally, when counting off, the final u of unu may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:\nUn'! Du! Tri! Kvar!\n\nHigher numbers\n\nAt numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots miliono (million) and miliardo (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A billion in most English-speaking countries is different from a billion in most other countries (109 vs. 1012 respectively; that is, a thousand million vs. a million million). The international root biliono is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix -iliono to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix -iliardo:\"[http://purl.org/net/voko/revo/art/bilion.html biliono]\" at Reta Vortaro\n\n106: miliono\n109: miliardo (or mil milionoj)\n1012: duiliono\n1015: duiliardo (or mil duilionoj)\n1018: triiliono\n1021: triiliardo (or mil triilionoj)\netc.\n\nNote that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: mil homojn (a thousand people [accusative]) but milionon da homoj (a million people [accusative]).\n\nCompound numerals and derivatives\n\nNumerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (dudek 20, dek du 12, dudek du 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix -a, quantities with the nominal suffix -o, multiples with -obl-, fractions with ‑on‑, collectives with ‑op‑, and repetitions with the root ‑foj‑.\n\nsescent sepdek kvin (675)\ntria (third [as in first, second, third])\ntrie (thirdly)\ndudeko (a score [20])\nduobla (double)\nkvarono (one fourth, a quarter)\nduope (by twos)\ndufoje (twice)\n\nThe particle po is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the logogram @ is not used (except in email addresses, of course):\nmi donis al ili po tri pomojn or pomojn mi donis al ili po tri (I gave [to] them three apples each).\n\nNote that particle po forms a phrase with the numeral tri and is not a preposition for the noun phrase tri pomojn, so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.\n\nComparisons\n\nComparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives tiel ... kiel (as ... as), the adverbial roots pli (more) and plej (most), the antonym prefix mal-, and the preposition ol (than):\n\nmi skribas tiel bone kiel vi (I write as well as you)\ntiu estas pli bona ol tiu (this one is better than that one)\ntio estas la plej bona (that's the best)\nla mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via (mine is less expensive than yours)\n\nImplied comparisons are made with tre (very) and tro (too [much]).\n\nPhrases like \"The more people, the smaller the portions\" and \"All the better!\" are translated using ju and des in place of \"the\":\nJu pli da homoj, des malpli grandaj la porcioj (The more people, the smaller the portions)\nDes pli bone! (All the better!)\n\nWord order\n\nEsperanto has a fairly flexible word order. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ne generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):\nmi ne iris 'I didn't go'\nmi ne iris, mi revenis 'I didn't go, I came back'\nne mi iris or iris ne mi 'it wasn't me who went'\nmi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen 'I went not to the shop but home'.\nHowever, when the entire clause is negated, the ne may be left till last:\nmi iris ne 'I went not'.\n\nThe last order reflects a typical topic–comment (or theme–rheme) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, ne iris mi, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and mi is given as an example of one who did not go.\n\nCompare:Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#vortordo 'La artikolo'], in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo\n\nPasintjare mi feriis en Italujo\n:'Last year I vacationed in Italy' (Italy was the place I went on holiday)\nEn Italujo mi feriis pasintjare\n:'I vacationed in Italy last year' (last year was when I went)\nEn Italujo pasintjare mi feriis\n:'In Italy last year I went on vacation' (a vacation is why I went)\nEn Italujo pasintjare feriis mi\n:(I am the one who went)\n\nThe noun phrase\n\nWithin a noun phrase, either the order adjective–noun or noun–adjective may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with numeral–noun and demonstrative–noun being the norm, as in English.\nblua ĉielo 'a blue sky'\ntiu ĉielo 'that sky'\ntiu blua ĉielo 'that blue sky'\nsep bluaj ĉieloj 'seven blue heavens'\n\nAdjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:\nhomo malgrandanima kaj ege avara 'a petty and extremely greedy person'\nvizaĝo plena de cikatroj 'a face full of scars'\nideo fantazia sed tamen interesa 'a fantastic but still interesting idea'\n\nAdjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:\nokazis io stranga 'something strange happened'\nne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto 'not everything shiny is a diamond'\nChanging the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative nenio 'nothing':\nli manĝis nenion etan 'he ate nothing little'\nli manĝis etan nenion 'he ate a little nothing'\n\nWith multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–(adjective/noun):\nmiaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj 'my two great friends'.\n\nHowever, the article la comes precedes a noun phrase:\nla blua ĉielo \"the blue sky\"\n\nIn prepositional phrases, the preposition is required to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article la), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:\nal la ĉielo 'to the sky' or ĉielen 'skywards', never *ĉielo al\n\nConstituent order\n\nConstituent order within a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.\n\nThe default order is subject–verb–object, though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon 'the dog chased/hunted the cat'\nla katon ĉasis la hundo\nĉasis la hundo la katon\nĉasis la katon la hundo\nla hundo la katon ĉasis\nla katon la hundo ĉasis\nThe expectation of a topic–comment (theme–rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in la katon ĉasis la hundo, the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in la hundo la katon ĉasis, the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in ĉasis la hundo la katon, the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.\n\nContext is required to tell whether\nla hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno\nmeans the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with\nla hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno\n:'The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden'\nand\nen la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon\n:'In the garden, the dog chased the cat'.\n\nOf course, if it chases the cat into the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardenon, en la ĝardenon la hundo ĉasis la katon, etc.\n\nWithin copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. Copulas are words such as esti 'be', iĝi 'become', resti 'remain', and ŝajni 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.John Wells, 1978, Lingvistikaj aspektoj de Esperanto, p 42 ff\n\nGenerally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:\nsovaĝa estas la vento 'wild is the wind', la vento estas sovaĝa 'the wind is wild'\nHowever, la vento sovaĝa estas is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.\n\nAttributive phrases and clauses\n\nIn the sentence above, la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the relative pronoun kiu 'which' is restricted to a position after the noun 'cat'. In general, relative clauses and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.\n\nAttributive prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (la libro de Johano 'John's book') as well as la kato en la ĝardeno 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither *la de Johano libro nor *la en la ĝardeno kato is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both ĉasis en la ĝardeno and en la ĝardeno ĉasis are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.\n\nRelative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a relative pronoun such as kiu 'which':\nfuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis 'the cat which it chased fled'\nmi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\nNote that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs.This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between 'who' and 'whom'. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin 'the dog which chased it fled'; mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis 'I saw the cat, which the dog chased'. However, they do agree in number:\nfuĝis la katoj, kiujn ĝi ĉasis 'the cats which it chased fled'\n\nOther word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:\nfuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi 'the cat which it chased fled'\nvidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\n\nClause order\n\nCoordinate clauses allow flexible word order, but tend to be iconic. For example, in\nla hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis 'the dog chased the cat and the cat fled',\nthe inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:\nla kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin 'the cat fled, and the dog chased it'\nThis distinction is lost in subordinate clauses such as the relative clauses in the previous section:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis 'the dog chased the cat(,) which fled'\nIn written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.\n\nNon-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the conjunction ke 'that', as in,\nMi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson 'I am certain that you will have a brilliant success'.\n\nNon-Indo-European aspects\n\nEsperanto's vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically Romance or Germanic in origin. The semantics shows a significant Slavic influence.\n\nIt is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is song sing sang sung. However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as cat, cats and walk, walked do in English. (This is the so-called strong–weak dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as pli, plej, plu (more, most, further), tre, tro (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes ‑as, ‑anta, ‑ata; ‑is, ‑inta, ‑ita; ‑os, ‑onta, ‑ota; and ‑us.\n\nOther features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the -o suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian.For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular -o and -a, adjectives in -oje and -aja, adverbs in -o and -e, etc.; cf. also Provençal la fenestro (the window), which is identical to Esperanto la fenestro. More pertinent is the accusative plural in -jn. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European Hungarian and Turkish languages—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed \"non-European\" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.\n\nEast Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as la ĉielo bluas (the sky is blue) for la ĉielo estas blua and mia filino belu! (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the mia filino estu bela! mentioned above.\n\nSample text\n\nThe Pater noster, from the first Esperanto publication in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:\n\nPatro nia, kiu estas en la ĉieloj,\nsanktigata estu Via nomo.\nVenu Via regno,\nfariĝu Via volo,\nkiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.\nNian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.\nKaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,\nkiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.\nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton,\nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.\n(Ĉar Via estas la regno kaj la potenco\nkaj la gloro eterne.)\nAmen.\n\nThe morphologically complex words (see Esperanto word formation) are:",

    "aggregatedText" : "Esperanto is a constructed language. Due to its highly regular grammar, it is often said that Esperanto is easier to learn than other languages. \n\nEach part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ‑o; adjectives with ‑a; present‑tense indicative verbs with ‑as, and so on.\n\nIt is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 \"meaning words\", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.\n\nReference grammars include the Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo) () by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien, and the Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko () by Bertilo Wennergren.\n\nGrammatical summary\n\nEsperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the indicative has three tenses, and are derived for several aspects, but do not agree with the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects information flow and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nScript and pronunciation\n\nEsperanto uses the Latin alphabet with six additional lettersĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭand does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.\n\nZamenhof suggested Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation.\n\nThe article\n\nEsperanto has a single definite article, la, which is invariable. It is similar to English \"the\".\n\nLa is used:\n\nFor identifiable, countable objects:\n:Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.\n::\"I found a bottle and took off the lid.\"\nFor representative individuals:\n:La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.\n::\"The cheetah is the fastest of the animals.\"\n:La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi.\n::\"Bees have fur, but they're no good for petting.\"\nFor adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:\n:la blua\n:: \"the blue one\"\n:la angla\n:: \"English\" (i.e. \"the English language\")\nFor possessive pronouns, when definite:\n:La mia bluas, la via ruĝas.\n::\"Mine is blue, yours is red\".\n\nThe article is also used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a possessive adjective:\nIli tranĉis la manon.\n:\"They cut their hands.\" [one hand each]\n\nThe article la, like the demonstrative adjective tiu (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the noun phrase.\n\nThere is no grammatically required indefinite article: homo means either \"human being\" or \"a human being\", depending on the context, and similarly the plural homoj means \"human beings\" or \"some human beings\". The words iu and unu (or their plurals iuj and unuj) may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to \"some\" and \"a certain\" than to English \"a\". This use of unu corresponds to English \"a\" when the \"a\" indicates a specific individual.Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#specifa 'La artikolo'], in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo\n\nParts of speech\n\nThe suffixes ‑o, ‑a, ‑e, and ‑i indicate that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word vidi (to see) are vida (visual), vide (visually), and vido (vision).\n\nEach root word has an inherent part of speech: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix ‑o indicates an abstraction: parolo (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root paroli (to speak); belo (beauty) from the adjectival root bela (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ‑a: reĝa (royal), from the nominal root reĝo (a king); parola (spoken). The various verbal endings mean to be [__] when added to an adjectival root: beli (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean \"to act as\" the noun, \"to use\" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: reĝi (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in -e are derived: bele (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a prepositional phrase: parole (by speech, orally); vide (by sight, visually); reĝe (like a king, royally).\n\nThe meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry broso), whereas kombi (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under kombi). Change the suffix to -o, and the similar meanings of brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.\n\nA limited number of basic adverbs do not end with -e, but with an undefined part-of-speech ending -aŭ. Not all words ending in -aŭ are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in -aŭ have other functions, such as hodiaŭ \"today\" [noun or adverb] or ankoraŭ \"yet, still\" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as nun \"now\", tro \"too, too much\", not counting the adverbs among the correlatives. (See special Esperanto adverbs.)\n\nOther parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions (al \"to\"), conjunctions (kaj \"and\"), interjections (ho \"oh\"), numerals (du \"two\"), and pronouns (mi \"I\"—The final -i found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical \"particles\" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ne (not), ankaŭ (also), nur (only), eĉ (even).\n\nNouns and adjectives\n\nA suffix -j following the noun or adjective suffixes -o or -a makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a countable noun is understood to be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix -n, which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence -ojn rhymes with English coin, and -ajn rhymes with fine.)\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they modify are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in subject–object–verb or verb–subject–object clauses:\n\nla knabino feliĉan knabon kisis (the girl kissed a happy boy)\nla knabino feliĉa knabon kisis (the happy girl kissed a boy).\n\nAgreement clarifies the syntax in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:\nruĝaj domo kaj aŭto (a red house and [a red] car)\nruĝa domo kaj aŭto (a red house and a car).\n\nA predicative adjective does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:\nmi farbis la pordon ruĝan (I painted the red door)\nmi farbis la pordon ruĝa (I painted the door red).\n\nPronouns\n\nThere are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal (vi \"you plural\"), demonstrative (tio \"that\", iu \"someone\"), and relative/interrogative (kio \"what\").\nAccording to the fifth rulehttp://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html of the Fundamento de Esperanto:\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nThe Esperanto personal pronoun system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a reflexive pronoun.\n\n Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun ci to be used in translations from languages where the T–V distinction is important, and added it in the Dua Libro in 1888 clarifying that \"this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used\". It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didn't include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the Fundamento and in his 28th Lingva Respondo, published in 1908, recommended to use only vi. The normal usage is to use vi regardless of number or formality. However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ci in practical speech.\n\nPersonal pronouns take the accusative suffix -n as nouns do: min (me), lin (him), ŝin (her). Possessive adjectives are formed with the adjectival suffix -a: mia (my), ĝia (its), nia (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: ni salutis liajn amikojn (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: la mia (mine).\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer to back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:\nli lavis sin \"he washed\" (himself)\nili lavis sin \"they washed\" (themselves or each other)\nli lavis lin \"he washed him\" (someone else)\nli manĝis sian panon \"he ate his bread\" (his own bread)\nli manĝis lian panon \"he ate his bread\" (someone else's bread).\n\nThe indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject it with a passive verb,\noni diras, ke ... \"One says that...\", meaning: \"they say that ...\" or \"it's said that ...\"\nWith \"impersonal\" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:\npluvas \"rains; is raining; it's raining\".\n\nThe rain is falling by itself, therefore \"it\" doesn't get used.\n\nĜi (\"it\"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an epicene (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, Aŭgusto However, this proposal is not generally accepted.\n\nIn popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:\nLa infano estas ploranta, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi \"the child is crying, because it wants to eat\".\nWhen speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun tiu (\"that thing or person that is already known to the listener\") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence\nIu ĵus diris, ke tiu malsatas \"Someone just said that that thing/person is hungry\",\nthe word tiu would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns this or that but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of ĝi, li or ŝi.\n\nOther pronouns\n\nThe demonstrative and relative pronouns form part of the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in -o (simple pronouns) and -u (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in -n, but the genitive case ends in -es, which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases lia domo (his house) and ties domo (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural liaj domoj (his houses) and ties domoj (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive lian domon and ties domon.An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition na has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun (ties, accusative na ties). The purposefully ambiguous preposition je may be so used as well (accusative je ties), though normally the -es words are simply not inflected for case.\n\nPrepositions\n\nAlthough Esperanto word order is fairly free, prepositions must come at the beginning of a noun phrase. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various cases (accusative, dative, and so on), in Esperanto all prepositions govern the nominative: por Johano (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is replaced by the accusative.\n\nPrepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition je should be used:\nili iros je la tria de majo (they'll go on the third of May: the \"on\" isn't literally true).\n\nAlternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:\nili iros la trian de majo.\n\nNote that although la trian (the third) is in the accusative, de majo (of May) is still a prepositional phrase, and so the noun majo remains in the nominative case.\n\nA frequent use of the accusative is in place of al (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion (allative construction). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:\nla kato ĉasis la muson en la domo (the cat chased the mouse in [inside of] the house)\nla kato ĉasis la muson en la domon (the cat chased the mouse into the house).\n\nThe accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:\nli iris al sia hejmo (he went to his home)\nli iris hejmen (he went home)\n\nBoth por and pro often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish for a goal (looking forward in time, or causing: por) and for a cause (looking back in time, or being caused by: pro): To vote por your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote pro your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.\n\nThe preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps de, which corresponds to English of, from, off, and (done) by:\nlibro de Johano (John's book)\nli venis de la butiko (he came from the shop)\nmordita de hundo (bitten by a dog)\n\nHowever, English of corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: de, el (out of, made of), and da (quantity of, unity of form and contents):\ntablo el ligno (a table of wood)\nglaso da vino (a glass of wine)\nlisto da kondiĉoj de la kandidatoj (a list of conditions from the candidates)\nThe last of these, da, is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.Sergio Pokrovskij, 2007. \"[http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#Da La artikolo]\", in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo.See the entry for da at Wiktionary.\n\nOccasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare root may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) we get the preposition far (done by).\n\nVerbs\n\nAll verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the indicative mood. The other moods are the infinitive, conditional, and jussive. No aspectual distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of Aktionsart are common.\n\nVerbs do not change form according to their subject. I am, we are, and he is are simply mi estas, ni estas, and li estas, respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: pluvas (it is raining); estas muso en la domo (there's a mouse in the house).\n\nMost verbs are inherently transitive or intransitive. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes -ig- (the transitivizer/causative) and -iĝ- (the intransitivizer/middle voice):\nakvo bolas je cent gradoj (water boils at 100 degrees)\nni boligas la akvon (we boil the water).\n\nThe verbal paradigm\n\nThe tenses have characteristic vowels. A indicates the present tense, i the past, and o the future.\n\nThe verbal forms may be illustrated with the root esper- (hope):\nesperi (to hope)\nesperas (hopes, is hoping)\nesperis (hoped, was hoping)\nesperos (shall hope, will hope)\nesperu (hope!; a command)\nesperus (were to hope, would hope)\n\nA verb can be made emphatic with the particle ja (indeed): mi ja esperas (I do hope), mi ja esperis (I did hope).\n\nTense\n\nAs in English, Esperanto present tense may be used for generic statements such as \"birds fly\" (la birdoj flugas).\n\nThe Esperanto future is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English \"(I'll give it to you) when I see you\" the verb \"see\" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: (Mi donos ĝin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin.\n\nEsperanto tense is relative. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a subordinate verb is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, \"John said that he would go\" is in Esperanto Johano diris, ke li iros (lit., \"John said that he will go\"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as \"John said that he will go\" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.\n\nMood\n\nThe conditional mood is used for such expressions as se mi povus, mi irus (if I could, I would go) and se mi estus vi, mi irus (if I were you, I'd go).\n\nThe jussive mood, is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the imperative and subjunctive:\nIru! (Go!)\nMi petis, ke li venu. (I asked him to come.)\nLi parolu. (Let him speak.)\nNi iru. (Let's go.)\nBenu ĉi tiun domaĉon. (Bless this bad house.)\nMia filino belu! (May my daughter be beautiful!)\n\nCopula\n\nThe verb esti (to be) is both the copula (\"X is Y\") and the existential (\"there is\") verb. As a copula linking two noun phrases, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with esti can be semantically important: compare hundoj estas personoj (dogs are people) and personoj estas hundoj (people are dogs).\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common to replace esti-plus-adjective with a verb: la ĉielo estas blua or la ĉielo bluas (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: Morti (to die) does not have the same meaning as esti morta (to be dead).\n\nParticiples\n\nParticiples are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:\n* three aspects: past (or \"perfective\"), present (or \"progressive\"), and future (or \"predictive\")\ntimes\n* two voices: active (performing an action) and passive (receiving an action)\nThe participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: i, a, o. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing voice, with either nt or t following the vowel (see next section).\n\nAdjectival participles\n\nThe basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb fali (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are falonta (about to fall). As they drop, they are falanta (falling). After they hit the ground, they are falinta (fallen).\n\nActive and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb haki (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is hakonta (about to chop) and the tree is hakota (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is hakanta (chopping) and the tree hakata (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is hakinta (having chopped) and the tree hakita (chopped).\n\nAdjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:\nili ŝparis la arbojn hakotajn (they spared the trees [that were] to be chopped down).\n\nCompound tense\n\nCompound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus esti (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:\n*Present progressive: mi estas kaptanta (I am catching [something]), mi estas kaptata (I am being caught)\n*Present perfect: mi estas kaptinta (I have caught [something]), mi estas kaptita (I have been caught, I am caught)\n*Present prospective: mi estas kaptonta (I am going to catch / about to catch), mi estas kaptota (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)\n\nThese are not used as often as their English equivalents. For \"I am going to the store\", you would normally use the simple present mi iras in Esperanto.\n\nThe tense and mood of esti can be changed in these compound tenses:\nmi estis kaptinta (I had caught)\nmi estus kaptonta (I would be about to catch)\nmi estos kaptanta (I will be catching).\n\nAlthough such periphrastic constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [esti + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:\n\nmi estas kaptinta or mi kaptintas (I have caught)\nmi estis kaptinta or mi kaptintis (I had caught)\n\nThe active synthetic forms are:\n\nInfinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably -intus and -atas, entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.Bertilo Wennergren, Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko, [http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/participoj/kunmetitaj_verboformoj/nekutimaj.html Nekutimaj kunmetitaj verboj]\n\nNominal participles\n\nParticiples may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix -a with -e or -o. This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.\n\nA nominal participle indicates one who participates in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, esperinto is a \"hoper\" (past tense), or one who had been hoping.\n\nAdverbial participles\n\nAdverbial participles are used with subjectless clauses:\nKaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen (Having caught the ball, he ran for the goal).\n\nConditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)\n\nOccasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel u (-unt-, -ut-).Timothy Reagan (2009) Language Matters: Reflections on Educational Linguistics, p. 167 If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be hakunta and the tree hakuta (he, the one \"who would chop\", and the tree, the one that \"would be chopped\").\n\nThis can also be illustrated with the verb prezidi (to preside). Just after the recount of the 2000 United States presidential election:\n*then-president Bill Clinton was still prezidanto (current president) of the United States,\n*president-elect George W. Bush was declared prezidonto (president-to-be),\n*the previous president George H. W. Bush was a prezidinto (former president), and\n*the contending candidate Al Gore was prezidunto (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for 'president' (of a country) is the tense-neutral word prezidento. Prezidanto is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and prezidinto is used for former presidents in such contexts.\n\nThe tense-neutral word prezidento is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb prezidi.\n\nNegation\n\nA statement is made negative by using ne or one of the negative (neni-) correlatives. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:\n\nMi ne faris ion ajn. I didn't do anything.\n\nTwo negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.\n\nMi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion. It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.\n\nThe word ne comes before the word it negates:\nMi ne skribis tion (I didn't write that)\nNe mi skribis tion (It wasn't I who wrote that)\nMi skribis ne tion (It wasn't that that I wrote)\n\nThe latter will frequently be reordered as ne tion mi skribis depending on the flow of information.\n\nQuestions\n\n\"Wh\" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative (ki-) correlatives. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:\n\nLi scias, kion vi faris (He knows what you did.)\nKion vi faris? (What did you do?)\nVi faris kion? (You did what?)\n\nYes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ĉu (whether):\n\nMi ne scias, ĉu li venos (I don't know whether he'll come)\nĈu li venos? (Will he come?)\n\nSuch questions can be answered jes (yes) or ne (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ĝuste (correct) or malĝuste (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:\n\nĈu vi ne iris? (Did you not go?)\n— Ne, mi ne iris (No, I didn't go); — Jes, mi iris (Yes, I went)\n— Ĝuste, mi ne iris (Correct, I didn't go); — Malĝuste, mi iris (Incorrect, I did go)\n\nNote that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.\n\nConjunctions\n\nBasic Esperanto conjunctions are kaj (both/and), aŭ (either/or), nek (neither/nor), se (if), ĉu (whether/or), sed (but), anstataŭ (instead of), krom (besides, in addition to), kiel (like, as), ke (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:\n\nMi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon (I saw both him and his friend)\nEstis nek hele nek agrable (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)\nĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo (whether by whim, or by natural language development)\nLi volus, ke ni iru (he would like us to go)\n\nHowever, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from Don Harlow:\n\nLi traktis min kiel princon (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)\nLi traktis min kiel princo (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)\n\nInterjections\n\nInterjections may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ek! (get going!), from the perfective prefix; um (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; fek! (shit!), from feki (to defecate).\n\nWord formation\n\nEsperanto derivational morphology uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.\n\nNumbers\n\nNumerals\n\nThe cardinal numerals are:\n\nnul (zero)\nunu (one)\ndu (two)\ntri (three)\nkvar (four)\nkvin (five)\nses (six)\nsep (seven)\nok (eight)\nnaŭ (nine)\ndek (ten)\ncent (one hundred)\nmil (one thousand)\n\nThese are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, unu (and only unu) is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning \"a certain\", and in such cases it may take the plural affix -j, just as the demonstrative pronoun tiu does:\nunuj homoj\n\"certain people\";\nili kuris unuj post la aliaj\n\"they ran some after others\".\nIn such use unu is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix -n in the singular, but does in the plural:\nian unu ideon\n\"some particular idea\",\nbut\nunuj objektoj venis en unujn manojn, aliaj en aliajn manojn\n\"some objects come into certain hands, others into other hands\".\nAdditionally, when counting off, the final u of unu may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:\nUn'! Du! Tri! Kvar!\n\nHigher numbers\n\nAt numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots miliono (million) and miliardo (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A billion in most English-speaking countries is different from a billion in most other countries (109 vs. 1012 respectively; that is, a thousand million vs. a million million). The international root biliono is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix -iliono to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix -iliardo:\"[http://purl.org/net/voko/revo/art/bilion.html biliono]\" at Reta Vortaro\n\n106: miliono\n109: miliardo (or mil milionoj)\n1012: duiliono\n1015: duiliardo (or mil duilionoj)\n1018: triiliono\n1021: triiliardo (or mil triilionoj)\netc.\n\nNote that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: mil homojn (a thousand people [accusative]) but milionon da homoj (a million people [accusative]).\n\nCompound numerals and derivatives\n\nNumerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (dudek 20, dek du 12, dudek du 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix -a, quantities with the nominal suffix -o, multiples with -obl-, fractions with ‑on‑, collectives with ‑op‑, and repetitions with the root ‑foj‑.\n\nsescent sepdek kvin (675)\ntria (third [as in first, second, third])\ntrie (thirdly)\ndudeko (a score [20])\nduobla (double)\nkvarono (one fourth, a quarter)\nduope (by twos)\ndufoje (twice)\n\nThe particle po is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the logogram @ is not used (except in email addresses, of course):\nmi donis al ili po tri pomojn or pomojn mi donis al ili po tri (I gave [to] them three apples each).\n\nNote that particle po forms a phrase with the numeral tri and is not a preposition for the noun phrase tri pomojn, so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.\n\nComparisons\n\nComparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives tiel ... kiel (as ... as), the adverbial roots pli (more) and plej (most), the antonym prefix mal-, and the preposition ol (than):\n\nmi skribas tiel bone kiel vi (I write as well as you)\ntiu estas pli bona ol tiu (this one is better than that one)\ntio estas la plej bona (that's the best)\nla mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via (mine is less expensive than yours)\n\nImplied comparisons are made with tre (very) and tro (too [much]).\n\nPhrases like \"The more people, the smaller the portions\" and \"All the better!\" are translated using ju and des in place of \"the\":\nJu pli da homoj, des malpli grandaj la porcioj (The more people, the smaller the portions)\nDes pli bone! (All the better!)\n\nWord order\n\nEsperanto has a fairly flexible word order. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ne generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):\nmi ne iris 'I didn't go'\nmi ne iris, mi revenis 'I didn't go, I came back'\nne mi iris or iris ne mi 'it wasn't me who went'\nmi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen 'I went not to the shop but home'.\nHowever, when the entire clause is negated, the ne may be left till last:\nmi iris ne 'I went not'.\n\nThe last order reflects a typical topic–comment (or theme–rheme) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, ne iris mi, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and mi is given as an example of one who did not go.\n\nCompare:Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#vortordo 'La artikolo'], in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo\n\nPasintjare mi feriis en Italujo\n:'Last year I vacationed in Italy' (Italy was the place I went on holiday)\nEn Italujo mi feriis pasintjare\n:'I vacationed in Italy last year' (last year was when I went)\nEn Italujo pasintjare mi feriis\n:'In Italy last year I went on vacation' (a vacation is why I went)\nEn Italujo pasintjare feriis mi\n:(I am the one who went)\n\nThe noun phrase\n\nWithin a noun phrase, either the order adjective–noun or noun–adjective may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with numeral–noun and demonstrative–noun being the norm, as in English.\nblua ĉielo 'a blue sky'\ntiu ĉielo 'that sky'\ntiu blua ĉielo 'that blue sky'\nsep bluaj ĉieloj 'seven blue heavens'\n\nAdjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:\nhomo malgrandanima kaj ege avara 'a petty and extremely greedy person'\nvizaĝo plena de cikatroj 'a face full of scars'\nideo fantazia sed tamen interesa 'a fantastic but still interesting idea'\n\nAdjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:\nokazis io stranga 'something strange happened'\nne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto 'not everything shiny is a diamond'\nChanging the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative nenio 'nothing':\nli manĝis nenion etan 'he ate nothing little'\nli manĝis etan nenion 'he ate a little nothing'\n\nWith multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–(adjective/noun):\nmiaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj 'my two great friends'.\n\nHowever, the article la comes precedes a noun phrase:\nla blua ĉielo \"the blue sky\"\n\nIn prepositional phrases, the preposition is required to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article la), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:\nal la ĉielo 'to the sky' or ĉielen 'skywards', never *ĉielo al\n\nConstituent order\n\nConstituent order within a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.\n\nThe default order is subject–verb–object, though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon 'the dog chased/hunted the cat'\nla katon ĉasis la hundo\nĉasis la hundo la katon\nĉasis la katon la hundo\nla hundo la katon ĉasis\nla katon la hundo ĉasis\nThe expectation of a topic–comment (theme–rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in la katon ĉasis la hundo, the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in la hundo la katon ĉasis, the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in ĉasis la hundo la katon, the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.\n\nContext is required to tell whether\nla hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno\nmeans the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with\nla hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno\n:'The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden'\nand\nen la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon\n:'In the garden, the dog chased the cat'.\n\nOf course, if it chases the cat into the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardenon, en la ĝardenon la hundo ĉasis la katon, etc.\n\nWithin copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. Copulas are words such as esti 'be', iĝi 'become', resti 'remain', and ŝajni 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.John Wells, 1978, Lingvistikaj aspektoj de Esperanto, p 42 ff\n\nGenerally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:\nsovaĝa estas la vento 'wild is the wind', la vento estas sovaĝa 'the wind is wild'\nHowever, la vento sovaĝa estas is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.\n\nAttributive phrases and clauses\n\nIn the sentence above, la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the relative pronoun kiu 'which' is restricted to a position after the noun 'cat'. In general, relative clauses and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.\n\nAttributive prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (la libro de Johano 'John's book') as well as la kato en la ĝardeno 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither *la de Johano libro nor *la en la ĝardeno kato is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both ĉasis en la ĝardeno and en la ĝardeno ĉasis are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.\n\nRelative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a relative pronoun such as kiu 'which':\nfuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis 'the cat which it chased fled'\nmi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\nNote that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs.This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between 'who' and 'whom'. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin 'the dog which chased it fled'; mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis 'I saw the cat, which the dog chased'. However, they do agree in number:\nfuĝis la katoj, kiujn ĝi ĉasis 'the cats which it chased fled'\n\nOther word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:\nfuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi 'the cat which it chased fled'\nvidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\n\nClause order\n\nCoordinate clauses allow flexible word order, but tend to be iconic. For example, in\nla hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis 'the dog chased the cat and the cat fled',\nthe inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:\nla kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin 'the cat fled, and the dog chased it'\nThis distinction is lost in subordinate clauses such as the relative clauses in the previous section:\nla hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis 'the dog chased the cat(,) which fled'\nIn written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.\n\nNon-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the conjunction ke 'that', as in,\nMi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson 'I am certain that you will have a brilliant success'.\n\nNon-Indo-European aspects\n\nEsperanto's vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically Romance or Germanic in origin. The semantics shows a significant Slavic influence.\n\nIt is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is song sing sang sung. However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as cat, cats and walk, walked do in English. (This is the so-called strong–weak dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as pli, plej, plu (more, most, further), tre, tro (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes ‑as, ‑anta, ‑ata; ‑is, ‑inta, ‑ita; ‑os, ‑onta, ‑ota; and ‑us.\n\nOther features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the -o suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian.For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular -o and -a, adjectives in -oje and -aja, adverbs in -o and -e, etc.; cf. also Provençal la fenestro (the window), which is identical to Esperanto la fenestro. More pertinent is the accusative plural in -jn. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European Hungarian and Turkish languages—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed \"non-European\" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.\n\nEast Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as la ĉielo bluas (the sky is blue) for la ĉielo estas blua and mia filino belu! (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the mia filino estu bela! mentioned above.\n\nSample text\n\nThe Pater noster, from the first Esperanto publication in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:\n\nPatro nia, kiu estas en la ĉieloj,\nsanktigata estu Via nomo.\nVenu Via regno,\nfariĝu Via volo,\nkiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.\nNian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.\nKaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,\nkiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.\nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton,\nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.\n(Ĉar Via estas la regno kaj la potenco\nkaj la gloro eterne.)\nAmen.\n\nThe morphologically complex words (see Esperanto word formation) are:.
