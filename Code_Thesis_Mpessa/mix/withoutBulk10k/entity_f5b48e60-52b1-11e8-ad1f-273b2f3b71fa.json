Jinnō Shōtōki, p. 151–163; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). \n\nTraditional narrative\n\nSaga was the second son of Emperor Kanmu and Fujiwara no Otomuro.Varley, p. 151.Brown and Ishida, p. 280. His personal name was .Titsingh, p. 96; Brown and Ishida, p. 280. Saga was an \"accomplished calligrapher\" able to compose in Chinese who held the first imperial poetry competitions (naien).Brown and Ishida, p. 281 According to legend, he was the first Japanese emperor to drink tea.\n\nSaga is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Saga's mausoleum.\n\nEvents of Saga's life\n\n* 806 Saga became the crown prince at age 21.\n* June 17, 809Julian dates derived from [http://web.me.com/meyer.eva/www.yukikurete.de/nengo_calc.htm NengoCalc] (): In the 4th year of Emperor Heizei's reign, he fell ill and abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by Kanmu's second son Saga, the eldest son having become a Buddhist priest.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, p. 96; Brown and Ishida, p. 280; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.\n\nSoon after his enthronement, Saga himself took ill. At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga's weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the Kusuko Incident; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by taishōgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict.Titsingh, p. 98; Varley, p. 151.  This same Tamuramaro is remembered in Aomori's annual nebuta  or neputa matsuri which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats.  These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement.  This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro's men.Boroff, Nicholas. National Geographic Traveler Japan, p. 156.\n* August 24, 842 (): Saga died at the age of 57.Brown and Ishida, p. 282; Varley, p. 163.\n\nEras of Saga's reign\n\nThe years of Saga's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (nengō).Titsingh, p. 97.\n* Daidō             (806–810)\n* Kōnin (810–824)\n\nLegacy\n\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the Gempeitōkitsu (源平藤橘).  One of these clans, the Minamoto clan are also known as Genji (源氏), and of these, the Saga Genji (嵯峨源氏) are descended from 52nd emperor Saga.  Saga's son, Minamoto no Tōru, is thought to be an inspiration for the protagonist of the novel The Tale of Genji.\n\nIn the 9th century, Emperor Saga made a decree prohibiting meat consumption except fish and birds and abolished capital punishment in 818. This remained the dietary habit of Japanese until the introduction of European dietary customs in the 19th century.\n\nEmperor Saga played an important role as a stalwart supporter of the Buddhist monk Kūkai.  The emperor helped Kūkai to establish the Shingon School of Buddhism by granting him Tō-ji Temple in the capital Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto).\n\nKugyō\n\n is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.Furugosho: [http://www.furugosho.com/moyenage/empereur-g2.htm kugyō of Saga-tennō]\n\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.
