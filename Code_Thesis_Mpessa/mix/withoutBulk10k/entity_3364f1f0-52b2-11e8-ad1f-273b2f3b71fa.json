[https://books.google.com/books?idbR9HAAAAQBAJ&pg\nRA2-PT321 Extract of page 321]\n\nGeneral form \n\nThe general form of L'Hôpital's rule covers many cases. Let  and  be extended real numbers (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). The real valued functions  and  are assumed to be differentiable on an open interval with endpoint , and additionally g'(x)\\ne 0 on the interval. It is also assumed that \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L. Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, and not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as  gets closer and closer to .\n\nIf either\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x) \\lim_{x\\to c}g(x) \n 0\n\nor\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}|f(x)| \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| \n \\infty,\n\nthen\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.\n\nThe limits may also be one-sided limits.  In the second case, the hypothesis that  diverges to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty.\n\nThe hypothesis \"g'(x)\\ne 0\" appears most commonly in the literature. Some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on a connected interval with endpoint .The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of this connected interval. Another method is to require that both  and  be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing .\n\nRequirement that the limit exist \n\nThe requirement that the limit\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n\nmust exist is essential. Without this condition, f' or g' may exhibit undampened oscillations as x approaches c, in which case L'Hôpital's rule does not apply. For example, if f(x)x+\\sin(x), g(x)\nx and c=\\pm\\infty, then\n\n\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\\frac{1+\\cos(x)}{1};\n\nthis expression does not approach a limit as x goes to c, since the cosine function oscillates between  and . But working with the original functions, \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} can be shown to exist:\n\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\right) \n 1. \n\nIn a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that\n\n \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\leq \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ,\n\nso that if the limit of f/g exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of f′/g′.  (In the example above, this is true, since 1 indeed lies between 0 and 2.)\n\nExamples\n\n* Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form  at :\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x} &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1)}{\\frac{d}{dx} x} \\\\\n  &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x}{1} \\\\\n  &= 1.\n\\end{align}\n\n* This is a more elaborate example involving . Applying L'Hôpital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\sin(x)-\\sin(2x)}{x-\\sin(x)}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\cos(x)-2\\cos(2x)}{1-\\cos(x)}} \\\\\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\sin(x)+4\\sin(2x)}{\\sin(x)}} \\\\\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\cos(x)+8\\cos(2x)}{\\cos(x)}} \\\\\n& ={\\frac{-2+8}{1}} \\\\\n& =6.\n\\end{align}\n\n* Here is another example involving :\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x^n\\cdot e^{-x}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^n}{e^x}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}\n=n\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.\n\nRepeatedly apply L'Hôpital's rule until the exponent is zero to conclude that the limit is zero.\n\n* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form  (see below), which is rewritten as the form :\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x \\ln x =\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{1}{x}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{x}}{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} -x \n 0.\n\n*Here is an example involving the Mortgage repayment formula and . Let  be the principal (loan amount),  the interest rate per period and  the number of periods.  When  is zero, the repayment amount per period is \\frac{P}{n} (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\frac{Pr(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}\n& = P \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{(1+r)^n+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{P}{n}.\n\\end{align}\n\n* One can also use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the following theorem. If  is differentiable in a neighborhood of , and twice-differentiable at , then\n\n:\\begin{align}\n    \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2f(x)}{h^2}\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2h} \\\\\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) + f(x-h)}{2} \\\\\n    &= f(x).\n  \\end{align}\n\n*Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose  converges as  and that e^x\\cdot f(x) converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x) \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\cdot f(x)}{e^x} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)\nand so,  \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)  exists and  \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f'(x) = 0.\nThe result remains true without the added hypothesis that e^x\\cdot f(x) converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.\n\nComplications \n\nSometimes L'Hôpital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:\n\n* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\cdots .\n\nThis situation can be dealt with by substituting y=e^x and noting that  goes to infinity as  goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} \n \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} \\frac{1}{1} \n 1.\n\nAlternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by e^x, at which point L'Hôpital's rule can immediately be applied successfully:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}} = 1.\n\n*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}}{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}+\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}+\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}}{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}-\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}} = \\cdots .\n\nThis situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case y = \\sqrt{x}:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} \n \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} \\frac1{1} \n 1.\n\nAgain, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by x^{1/2} before applying L'Hôpital's rule:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac{1}{2}+x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^\\frac{1}{2}-x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x+1}{x-1} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n\nA common pitfall is using L'Hôpital's rule with some circular reasoning to compute a derivative via a difference quotient. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for powers of x:\n\n\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1}.\n\nApplying L'Hôpital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to  of the numerator and the denominator yields \n as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven.  This is an example of begging the question, since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.\n\nCounterexamples when the derivative of the denominator is zero \n\nThe necessity of the condition g'(x)\\ne 0 can be seen by a counterexample due to Otto Stolz: Choosing f(x)\nx+\\sin x \\cos x, g(x)=f(x)e^{\\sin x}, there is no limit for \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} as x\\to\\infty. However, \n\n\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\frac{2\\cos^2 x}{2\\cos^2 x e^{\\sin x} + (x+\\sin x \\cos x)\\cos x e^{\\sin x}} \n \\frac{2\\cos x}{2 \\cos x +x+\\sin x \\cos x} e^{-\\sin x}, \n\nwhich tends to 0 as x\\to\\infty. Further examples of this type were found by Ralph P. Boas Jr.\n\nOther indeterminate forms \n\nOther indeterminate forms, such as , , , , and , can sometimes be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. For example, to evaluate a limit involving , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\left(\\frac{x}{x-1}-\\frac1{\\ln x}\\right)\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x -x+1}{(x-1)\\cdot\\ln x} & \\quad (1) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{x-1}{x}+\\ln x} & \\quad (2) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x}{x-1+x\\cdot\\ln x}     & \\quad (3) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{1+1+\\ln x}     & \\quad (4) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{2+\\ln x} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{2},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere L'Hôpital's rule is applied when going from (1) to (2) and again when going from (3) to (4).\n\nL'Hôpital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithms to \"move the exponent down\". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form :\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x^x\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\left(e^{\\ln x}\\right)^x\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}e^{x\\cdot\\ln x}\n= e^{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0^+}(x\\cdot\\ln x)}.\n\nIt is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because the exponential function is continuous. Now the exponent x has been \"moved down\". The limit \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x\\cdot\\ln x is of the indeterminate form , but as shown in an example above, l'Hôpital's rule may be used to determine that\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x\\cdot\\ln x = 0.\n\nThus\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x^x e^0 \n 1.\n\nStolz–Cesàro theorem \n\nThe Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operators rather than derivatives.\n\nGeometric interpretation \n\nConsider the curve in the plane whose -coordinate is given by  and whose -coordinate is given by , with both functions continuous, i.e., the locus of points of the form . Suppose . The limit of the ratio  as  is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point . The tangent to the curve at the point  is given by . L'Hôpital's rule then states that the slope of the tangent when  is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.\n\nProof of L'Hôpital's rule \n\nSpecial case\n\nThe proof of L'Hôpital's rule is simple in the case where  and  are continuously differentiable at the point  and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'Hôpital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that c be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. polynomials, sine and cosine, exponential functions), it is a special case worthy of attention.\n\nSuppose that  and  are continuously differentiable at a real number , that f(c)g(c)\n0, and that g'(c)\\neq 0. Then\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-0}{g(x)-0} \n \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{g(x)-g(c)} \\\\[4pt]\n{} & \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c} \\right)} \n \\frac{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c} \\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}\\right)}\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} \n \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThis follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because g'(c)\\ne 0.\n\nThe proof of a more general version of L'Hôpital's rule is given below.\n\nGeneral proof\n\nThe following proof is due to , where a unified proof for the  and  indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in  and .\n\nLet f and g be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let \\mathcal{I} be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint c. Considering that g'(x)\\ne 0 on this interval and g is continuous, \\mathcal{I} can be chosen smaller so that g is nonzero on \\mathcal{I}.Since g'  is nonzero and g is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for g to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the mean value theorem would assert the existence of a point p in the interval between the zeros such that g' (p) = 0. So either g is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of g.\n\nFor each x in the interval, define m(x)\\inf\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)} and M(x)\n\\sup\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)} as \\xi ranges over all values between x and c. (The symbols inf and sup denote the infimum and supremum.)\n\nFrom the differentiability of f and g on \\mathcal{I}, Cauchy's mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points x and y in \\mathcal{I} there exists a \\xi between x and y such that \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}. Consequently, m(x)\\leq \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)} \\leq M(x) for all choices of distinct x and y in the interval. The value g(x)-g(y) is always nonzero for distinct x and y in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a p between x and y such that g' (p)\n0.\n\nThe definition of m(x) and M(x) will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞.  In the following two cases, m(x) and M(x) will establish bounds on the ratio .\n\nCase 1: \\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)\n0\n\nFor any x in the interval \\mathcal{I}, and point y between x and c,\nm(x)\\le \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}-\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}}{1-\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}}\\le M(x)\nand therefore as y approaches c, \\frac{f(y)}{g(x)} and \\frac{g(y)}{g(x)} become zero, and so\nm(x)\\leq\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\leq M(x).\n\nCase 2: \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)|=\\infty\n\nFor every x in the interval \\mathcal{I}, define S_x=\\{y\\mid y \\text{ is between } x \\text{ and } c\\}. For every point y between x and c, we have\n\nm(x)\\le \\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{g(y)-g(x)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}-\\frac{f(x)}{g(y)}}{1-\\frac{g(x)}{g(y)}} \\le M(x).\n\nAs y approaches c, both \\frac{f(x)}{g(y)} and \\frac{g(x)}{g(y)} become zero, and therefore\n\nm(x)\\le \\liminf_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \\le \\limsup_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \\le M(x).\n\nThe limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of  has not yet been established.\n\nWe need the facts that\n\\lim_{x\\to c}m(x)\\lim_{x\\to c}M(x)\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=L\n\nNote \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) and \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x) exist as they are nondecreasing and nonincreasing functions of x, respectively.\n\nConsider a sequence x_i\\to c, we easily have \\lim_i m(x_i) \\le \\lim_i \\frac{f'(x_i)}{g'(x_i)} \\le \\lim_i M(x_i), as the inequality holds for each i; this yields the inequalities \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x)\n\nWe show \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x) \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}. Indeed, fix a sequence of numbers \\varepsilon_i > 0 such that  \\lim_i \\varepsilon_i 0, and a sequence x_i\\to c . For each i, we may choose x_i  such that \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\varepsilon_i \\ge \\sup_{x_i , by the definition of \\sup. Thus we have \\lim_i M(x_i) \\le \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\varepsilon_i \n \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\lim_i \\varepsilon_i = \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} as desired.\n\nThe argument that \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) \\ge \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} is similar.\n\nand\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\left(\\liminf_{y\\in S_x}\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\right)\\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} and \\lim_{x\\to c}\\left(\\limsup_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\right)\n\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}. \n\nIn case 1, the squeeze theorem establishes that \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} exists and is equal to L. In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that \\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\nL, and so the limit \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} exists and is equal to L. This is the result that was to be proven.\n\nNote: In case 2 we did not use the assumption that f(x) diverges to infinity within the proof. This means that if |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and both f and g satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hôpital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of f(x): It could even be the case that the limit of f(x) does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz.See proof at http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686.\n\nIn the case when |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and f(x) converges to a finite limit at c, then L'Hôpital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches c must be zero.\n\nCorollary \n\nA simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following:\nsuppose that f is continuous at a, and that f'(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Suppose, moreover, that \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x) exists. Then f'(a) also exists and\nf'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).\nIn particular, f is also continuous at a.\n\nProof\n\nConsider the functions h(x) f(x)-f(a) and  g(x) \n x-a. The continuity of f at a tells us that \\lim_{x\\to a}h(x) 0. We also have \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) \n 0 since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule we conclude that f'(a) :\\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} \n \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{h(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).",

The former spelling is still used in English where there is no circumflex.) published this rule in his 1696 book Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (literal translation: Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines), the first textbook on differential calculus.L’Hospital, Analyse des infiniment petits... , [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k205444w/f000171.tableDesMatieres pages 145–146]:  \"Proposition I.

[https://books.google.com/books?idbR9HAAAAQBAJ&pg\nRA2-PT321 Extract of page 321]\n\nGeneral form \n\nThe general form of L'Hôpital's rule covers many cases. Let  and  be extended real numbers (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). The real valued functions  and  are assumed to be differentiable on an open interval with endpoint , and additionally g'(x)\\ne 0 on the interval. It is also assumed that \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L. Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, and not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as  gets closer and closer to .\n\nIf either\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}f(x) \\lim_{x\\to c}g(x) \n 0\n\nor\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}|f(x)| \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| \n \\infty,\n\nthen\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.\n\nThe limits may also be one-sided limits.  In the second case, the hypothesis that  diverges to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)| = \\infty.\n\nThe hypothesis \"g'(x)\\ne 0\" appears most commonly in the literature. Some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on a connected interval with endpoint .The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of this connected interval. Another method is to require that both  and  be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing .\n\nRequirement that the limit exist \n\nThe requirement that the limit\n\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n\nmust exist is essential. Without this condition, f' or g' may exhibit undampened oscillations as x approaches c, in which case L'Hôpital's rule does not apply. For example, if f(x)x+\\sin(x), g(x)\nx and c=\\pm\\infty, then\n\n\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\\frac{1+\\cos(x)}{1};\n\nthis expression does not approach a limit as x goes to c, since the cosine function oscillates between  and . But working with the original functions, \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} can be shown to exist:\n\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\right) \n 1. \n\nIn a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that\n\n \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\leq \\liminf_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq \\limsup_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ,\n\nso that if the limit of f/g exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of f′/g′.  (In the example above, this is true, since 1 indeed lies between 0 and 2.)\n\nExamples\n\n* Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form  at :\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x} &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1)}{\\frac{d}{dx} x} \\\\\n  &= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{e^x}{1} \\\\\n  &= 1.\n\\end{align}\n\n* This is a more elaborate example involving . Applying L'Hôpital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\sin(x)-\\sin(2x)}{x-\\sin(x)}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{2\\cos(x)-2\\cos(2x)}{1-\\cos(x)}} \\\\\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\sin(x)+4\\sin(2x)}{\\sin(x)}} \\\\\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 0}{\\frac{-2\\cos(x)+8\\cos(2x)}{\\cos(x)}} \\\\\n& ={\\frac{-2+8}{1}} \\\\\n& =6.\n\\end{align}\n\n* Here is another example involving :\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}x^n\\cdot e^{-x}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^n}{e^x}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}\n=n\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}{\\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.\n\nRepeatedly apply L'Hôpital's rule until the exponent is zero to conclude that the limit is zero.\n\n* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form  (see below), which is rewritten as the form :\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x \\ln x =\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{1}{x}}\n  = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{x}}{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} -x \n 0.\n\n*Here is an example involving the Mortgage repayment formula and . Let  be the principal (loan amount),  the interest rate per period and  the number of periods.  When  is zero, the repayment amount per period is \\frac{P}{n} (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:\n\n:\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\frac{Pr(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}\n& = P \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{(1+r)^n+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{P}{n}.\n\\end{align}\n\n* One can also use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the following theorem. If  is differentiable in a neighborhood of , and twice-differentiable at , then\n\n:\\begin{align}\n    \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2f(x)}{h^2}\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2h} \\\\\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) + f(x-h)}{2} \\\\\n    &= f(x).\n  \\end{align}\n\n*Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose  converges as  and that e^x\\cdot f(x) converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x) \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\cdot f(x)}{e^x} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)}{e^x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\\bigr)\nand so,  \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)  exists and  \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f'(x) = 0.\nThe result remains true without the added hypothesis that e^x\\cdot f(x) converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.\n\nComplications \n\nSometimes L'Hôpital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:\n\n* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \\cdots .\n\nThis situation can be dealt with by substituting y=e^x and noting that  goes to infinity as  goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} \n \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} \\frac{1}{1} \n 1.\n\nAlternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by e^x, at which point L'Hôpital's rule can immediately be applied successfully:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}} = 1.\n\n*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}}{\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac1{2}}+\\frac1{2}x^{-\\frac3{2}}} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}+\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}}{-\\frac1{4}x^{-\\frac3{2}}-\\frac3{4}x^{-\\frac5{2}}} = \\cdots .\n\nThis situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case y = \\sqrt{x}:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac1{2}+x^{-\\frac1{2}}}{x^\\frac1{2}-x^{-\\frac1{2}}} \\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} \n \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} \\frac1{1} \n 1.\n\nAgain, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by x^{1/2} before applying L'Hôpital's rule:\n\n:\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x^\\frac{1}{2}+x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^\\frac{1}{2}-x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x+1}{x-1} \n \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n\nA common pitfall is using L'Hôpital's rule with some circular reasoning to compute a derivative via a difference quotient. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for powers of x:\n\n\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1}.\n\nApplying L'Hôpital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to  of the numerator and the denominator yields \n as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven.  This is an example of begging the question, since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.\n\nCounterexamples when the derivative of the denominator is zero \n\nThe necessity of the condition g'(x)\\ne 0 can be seen by a counterexample due to Otto Stolz: Choosing f(x)\nx+\\sin x \\cos x, g(x)=f(x)e^{\\sin x}, there is no limit for \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} as x\\to\\infty. However, \n\n\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\frac{2\\cos^2 x}{2\\cos^2 x e^{\\sin x} + (x+\\sin x \\cos x)\\cos x e^{\\sin x}} \n \\frac{2\\cos x}{2 \\cos x +x+\\sin x \\cos x} e^{-\\sin x}, \n\nwhich tends to 0 as x\\to\\infty. Further examples of this type were found by Ralph P. Boas Jr.\n\nOther indeterminate forms \n\nOther indeterminate forms, such as , , , , and , can sometimes be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. For example, to evaluate a limit involving , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\left(\\frac{x}{x-1}-\\frac1{\\ln x}\\right)\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x -x+1}{(x-1)\\cdot\\ln x} & \\quad (1) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{\\ln x}{\\frac{x-1}{x}+\\ln x} & \\quad (2) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x\\cdot\\ln x}{x-1+x\\cdot\\ln x}     & \\quad (3) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{1+1+\\ln x}     & \\quad (4) \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{1+\\ln x}{2+\\ln x} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{2},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere L'Hôpital's rule is applied when going from (1) to (2) and again when going from (3) to (4).\n\nL'Hôpital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithms to \"move the exponent down\". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form :\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x^x\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\left(e^{\\ln x}\\right)^x\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}e^{x\\cdot\\ln x}\n= e^{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0^+}(x\\cdot\\ln x)}.\n\nIt is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because the exponential function is continuous. Now the exponent x has been \"moved down\". The limit \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x\\cdot\\ln x is of the indeterminate form , but as shown in an example above, l'Hôpital's rule may be used to determine that\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x\\cdot\\ln x = 0.\n\nThus\n\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}x^x e^0 \n 1.\n\nStolz–Cesàro theorem \n\nThe Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operators rather than derivatives.\n\nGeometric interpretation \n\nConsider the curve in the plane whose -coordinate is given by  and whose -coordinate is given by , with both functions continuous, i.e., the locus of points of the form . Suppose . The limit of the ratio  as  is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point . The tangent to the curve at the point  is given by . L'Hôpital's rule then states that the slope of the tangent when  is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.\n\nProof of L'Hôpital's rule \n\nSpecial case\n\nThe proof of L'Hôpital's rule is simple in the case where  and  are continuously differentiable at the point  and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'Hôpital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that c be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. polynomials, sine and cosine, exponential functions), it is a special case worthy of attention.\n\nSuppose that  and  are continuously differentiable at a real number , that f(c)g(c)\n0, and that g'(c)\\neq 0. Then\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-0}{g(x)-0} \n \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{g(x)-g(c)} \\\\[4pt]\n{} & \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c} \\right)} \n \\frac{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}\\left(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\\right)}{\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c} \\left(\\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}\\right)}\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} \n \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThis follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because g'(c)\\ne 0.\n\nThe proof of a more general version of L'Hôpital's rule is given below.\n\nGeneral proof\n\nThe following proof is due to , where a unified proof for the  and  indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in  and .\n\nLet f and g be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let \\mathcal{I} be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint c. Considering that g'(x)\\ne 0 on this interval and g is continuous, \\mathcal{I} can be chosen smaller so that g is nonzero on \\mathcal{I}.Since g'  is nonzero and g is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for g to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the mean value theorem would assert the existence of a point p in the interval between the zeros such that g' (p) = 0. So either g is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of g.\n\nFor each x in the interval, define m(x)\\inf\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)} and M(x)\n\\sup\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)} as \\xi ranges over all values between x and c. (The symbols inf and sup denote the infimum and supremum.)\n\nFrom the differentiability of f and g on \\mathcal{I}, Cauchy's mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points x and y in \\mathcal{I} there exists a \\xi between x and y such that \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}\\frac{f'(\\xi)}{g'(\\xi)}. Consequently, m(x)\\leq \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)} \\leq M(x) for all choices of distinct x and y in the interval. The value g(x)-g(y) is always nonzero for distinct x and y in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a p between x and y such that g' (p)\n0.\n\nThe definition of m(x) and M(x) will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞.  In the following two cases, m(x) and M(x) will establish bounds on the ratio .\n\nCase 1: \\lim_{x\\to c}f(x)\\lim_{x\\to c}g(x)\n0\n\nFor any x in the interval \\mathcal{I}, and point y between x and c,\nm(x)\\le \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}-\\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}}{1-\\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}}\\le M(x)\nand therefore as y approaches c, \\frac{f(y)}{g(x)} and \\frac{g(y)}{g(x)} become zero, and so\nm(x)\\leq\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\leq M(x).\n\nCase 2: \\lim_{x\\to c}|g(x)|=\\infty\n\nFor every x in the interval \\mathcal{I}, define S_x=\\{y\\mid y \\text{ is between } x \\text{ and } c\\}. For every point y between x and c, we have\n\nm(x)\\le \\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{g(y)-g(x)}=\\frac{\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}-\\frac{f(x)}{g(y)}}{1-\\frac{g(x)}{g(y)}} \\le M(x).\n\nAs y approaches c, both \\frac{f(x)}{g(y)} and \\frac{g(x)}{g(y)} become zero, and therefore\n\nm(x)\\le \\liminf_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \\le \\limsup_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \\le M(x).\n\nThe limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of  has not yet been established.\n\nWe need the facts that\n\\lim_{x\\to c}m(x)\\lim_{x\\to c}M(x)\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=L\n\nNote \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) and \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x) exist as they are nondecreasing and nonincreasing functions of x, respectively.\n\nConsider a sequence x_i\\to c, we easily have \\lim_i m(x_i) \\le \\lim_i \\frac{f'(x_i)}{g'(x_i)} \\le \\lim_i M(x_i), as the inequality holds for each i; this yields the inequalities \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x)\n\nWe show \\lim_{x\\to c}M(x) \\le \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}. Indeed, fix a sequence of numbers \\varepsilon_i > 0 such that  \\lim_i \\varepsilon_i 0, and a sequence x_i\\to c . For each i, we may choose x_i  such that \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\varepsilon_i \\ge \\sup_{x_i , by the definition of \\sup. Thus we have \\lim_i M(x_i) \\le \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\varepsilon_i \n \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \\lim_i \\varepsilon_i = \\lim_i \\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} as desired.\n\nThe argument that \\lim_{x\\to c}m(x) \\ge \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} is similar.\n\nand\n\\lim_{x\\to c}\\left(\\liminf_{y\\in S_x}\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\right)\\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} and \\lim_{x\\to c}\\left(\\limsup_{y\\in S_x} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\right)\n\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}. \n\nIn case 1, the squeeze theorem establishes that \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} exists and is equal to L. In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that \\liminf_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\limsup_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\nL, and so the limit \\lim_{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} exists and is equal to L. This is the result that was to be proven.\n\nNote: In case 2 we did not use the assumption that f(x) diverges to infinity within the proof. This means that if |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and both f and g satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hôpital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of f(x): It could even be the case that the limit of f(x) does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz.See proof at http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686.\n\nIn the case when |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and f(x) converges to a finite limit at c, then L'Hôpital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches c must be zero.\n\nCorollary \n\nA simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following:\nsuppose that f is continuous at a, and that f'(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Suppose, moreover, that \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x) exists. Then f'(a) also exists and\nf'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).\nIn particular, f is also continuous at a.\n\nProof\n\nConsider the functions h(x) f(x)-f(a) and  g(x) \n x-a. The continuity of f at a tells us that \\lim_{x\\to a}h(x) 0. We also have \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) \n 0 since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule we conclude that f'(a) :\\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} \n \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{h(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x\\to a}f'(x).
