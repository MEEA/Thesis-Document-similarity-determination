Ees is the plural of the name of the letter; the plural of the letter itself is rendered E's, Es, e's, or es. is the fifth letter and the second vowel in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is the most commonly used letter in many languages, including Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Latin letter 'E' differs little from its source, the Greek letter epsilon, 'Ε'. This in turn comes from the Semitic letter hê, which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented (and in foreign words); in Greek, hê became the letter epsilon, used to represent.  The various forms of the Old Italic script and the Latin alphabet followed this usage.\n\nUse in writing systems\n\nEnglish\n\nAlthough Middle English spelling used  to represent long and short, the Great Vowel Shift changed long /eː/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iː/ while short (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a mid vowel. In other cases, the letter is silent, generally at the end of words.\n\nOther languages\n\nIn the orthography of many languages it represents either,, , or some variation (such as a nasalized version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: ) to indicate contrasts.  Less commonly, as in French, German, or Saanich,  represents a mid-central vowel /ə/. Digraphs with  are common to indicate either diphthongs or monophthongs, such as  or  for or in English,  for in German, and  for in French or in German.\n\nOther systems\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet uses  for the close-mid front unrounded vowel or the mid front unrounded vowel.\n\nMost common letter\n\n'E' is the most common (or highest-frequency) letter in the English alphabet (starting off the typographer's phrase ETAOIN SHRDLU) and several other European languages, which has implications in both cryptography and data compression. In the story \"The Gold-Bug\" by Edgar Allan Poe, a character figures out a random character code by remembering that the most used letter in English is E. This makes it a hard and popular letter to use when writing lipograms. Ernest Vincent Wright's Gadsby (1939) is considered a \"dreadful\" novel, and supposedly \"at least part of Wright's narrative issues were caused by language limitations imposed by the lack of E.\"Ross Eckler, Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play.
