  "textBody" : "In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias (; ) is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people.\n\nThe concepts of Moshiach, Messianism, and of a Messianic Age originated in Judaism, and in the Hebrew Bible; a moshiach (messiah) is a king or High Priest traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil. However, messiahs were not exclusively Jewish, as the Hebrew Bible refers to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, as a messiah[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4828-cyrus#anchor7 Jewish Encyclopedia: Cyrus: Cyrus and the Jews]: \"This prophet, Cyrus, through whom were to be redeemed His chosen people, whom he would glorify before all the world, was the promised Messiah, 'the shepherd of Yhwh' (xliv. 28, xlv. 1).\" for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple.\n\nIn Judaism, the Jewish Messiah, hamashiach (המשיח, \"the Messiah\", \"the anointed one\"), often referred to as \"King Messiah\" (מלך המשיח, melekh mashiach), is to be a human leader, physically descended from the paternal Davidic line through King David and King Solomon. He is thought to accomplish predetermined things in only one future arrival, including the unification of the tribes of Israel,Megillah 17b–18a, Taanit 8b the gathering in of all Jews to Eretz Israel, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, the ushering in of a Messianic AgeSotah 9a of global universal peace, and the annunciation of the World to come (But the specific expression, \"hamashiach\" (המשיח, lit. \"the Messiah\"), does not occur in the Tanakh (\"Jewish Bible\")).\n\nIn Christianity, the Messiah is called the Christ, from , translating the Hebrew word of the same meaning.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term\nmessiah Etymology Online] The concept of the Messiah in Christianity originated from the Messiah in Judaism. However, unlike the concept of the Messiah in Judaism and Islam, the Messiah in Christianity is the Son of God. Christ became the accepted Christian designation and title of Jesus of Nazareth,Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure of Christianity, born c. 4 BC. because Christians believe that messianic prophecies in the Christian Old Testament were fulfilled in his mission, death, and resurrection. They believe that Christ will fulfill the rest of the Messianic prophecies in the Second Coming, specifically the prophecy of a future king who would come from the Davidic line and usher in a Messianic Age and World to Come.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus was a Prophet and the Masîḥ (مسيح), the Messiah in Islam, sent to the Israelites, and that he will return to Earth at the end of times, along with the Mahdi, and defeat al-Masih ad-Dajjal, the false Messiah.\n\nIn Ahmadiyya theology, these prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, and the terms \"Messiah\" and \"Mahdi\" are synonyms for one and the same person.\n\nIn Chabad messianism,also: Habad messianism, Lubavitcher messianism, mishichism, meshichism. Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh Rebbe of Chabad, are Messiah claimants. Resembling early Christianity, the deceased Menachem Mendel Schneerson is believed to be the Messiah among adherents of the Chabad movement; his second coming is believed to be imminent.\n\nEtymology\n\nMessiah (; in modern Jewish texts in English spelled Mashiach; , , , , , , ) literally means \"anointed one\".[http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame\n0&searchmessiah&searchmode\nnone Online Etymology Dictionary] In Hebrew, the Messiah is often referred to as מלך המשיח (Meleḵ ha-Mašīaḥ in the Tiberian vocalization,, literally meaning \"the Anointed King\".)\n\nThe Greek Septuagint version of the Old Testament renders all thirty-nine instances of the Hebrew word for \"anointed\" (Mašíaḥ) as Χριστός (Khristós). The New Testament records the Greek transliteration Μεσσίας, Messias twice in John.\n\nal-Masīḥ (proper name,) is the Arabic word for messiah. In modern Arabic, it is used as one of the many titles of Jesus. Masīḥ is used by Arab Christians as well as Muslims, and is written as Yasūʿ al-Masih (يسوع المسيح) by Arab Christians or ʿĪsā al-Masīḥ (عيسى المسيح) by Muslims. The word al-Masīḥ literally means \"the anointed\", \"the traveller\", or the \"one who cures by caressing\". In Qur'anic scripture, Jesus is mentioned as having been sent down by Allah, strengthened by the holy spirit, and hence, 'anointed' with the task of being a prophet and a \"recipient of sacred scripture\". The Israelites, to whom Isa was sent, had a traditional practice of anointing their kings with oil. An Imam Bukhari hadith describes Jesus as having wet hair that looked as if water was dripping from it, possibly meaning he was naturally anointed.Sahih Bukhari, [http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_4_55.php Volume 4, Book 55, Number 649] Muslims believe that this is just one of the many signs that proves that Jesus is the Messiah.\n\nJudaism\n\nThe literal translation of the Hebrew word mashiach (messiah) is \"anointed\", which refers to a ritual of consecrating someone or something by putting holy oil upon it. It is used throughout the Hebrew Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king, Jewish priests and prophets, the Jewish Temple and its utensils, unleavened bread, and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus king of Persia).Tanakh verses:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nIn Jewish eschatology, the term came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, to be king of God's kingdom, and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be God or a pre-existent divine Son of God. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as Messiah ben David, which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism. He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith.\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld idea in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. This happened once when Sabbatai Zevi, from Smirna (now İzmir, Turkey), claimed that he was the messiah that the Jewish community have been waiting for. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).\n\nA common modern rabbinic interpretation is that there is a potential messiah in every generation. The Talmud, which often uses stories to make a moral point (aggadah), tells of a highly respected rabbi who found the Messiah at the gates of Rome and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"\n\nA Kabbalistic tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace (Messiah ben David) will be preceded by Messiah ben Joseph, who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then Armilus, according to one group of sources, or Gog and Magog, according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.\n\nChabad \n\nYosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh Rebbe of Chabad,Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

He published about Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn to be \"Atzmus u'mehus alein vi er hat zich areingeshtalt in a guf\" (Yiddish and English for: \"Essence and Existence [of God] which has placed itself in a body\").Likutei Sichos, Vol 2, pp. 510-511. The gravesite of his deceased father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, known as \"the Ohel\", became a central point of focus for Menachem Mendel Schneerson's prayers and supplications.\n\nRegarding the deceased Menachem Mendel Schneerson, a later Chabad Halachic ruling claims that it was \"incumbent on every single Jew to heed the Rebbe's words and believe that he is indeed King Moshiach, who will be revealed imminently\". Outside of Chabad messianism, in Judaism, there is no basis to these claims. If anything, this resembles the faith in the resurrection of Jesus and his second coming in early Christianity.Freeman, Charles. The Closing of the Western Mind, p. 133. Vintage. 2002.\n\nStill today, the deceased rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson is believed to be the Messiah among adherents of the Chabad movement, and his second coming is believed to be imminent. He is venerated and invocated to by thousands of visitors and letters each year at the Ohel—especially in a pilgrimage each year on the anniversary of his death.The New York Observer, [http://observer.com/2014/07/rebbe-to-the-city-and-the-world/ \"Rebbe to the city and Rebbe to the world\"]. Editorial, 07/08/14.\n\nChristianity\n\nThe Greek translation of Messiah is khristos (), anglicized as Christ, and Christians commonly refer to Jesus as either the \"Christ\" or the \"Messiah\". Christians believe that Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission, death, and resurrection of Jesus and that he will return to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy.\n\nThe majority of historical and mainline Christian theologies consider Jesus to be the Son of God and God the Son, a concept of the Messiah fundamentally different from the Jewish and Islamic concepts. In each of the four New Testament Gospels, the only literal anointing of Jesus is conducted by a woman. In the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and John, this anointing occurs in Bethany, outside Jerusalem. In the Gospel of Luke, the anointing scene takes place at an indeterminate location, but context suggests it to be in Galilee, or even a separate anointing altogether.\n\nIslam\n\nWhile the term \"messiah\" does appear in Islam, the meaning is starkly different from that found in Christianity and Judaism. \"Though Islam shares many of the beliefs and characteristics of the two Semitic/Abrahamic/monotheistic religions which preceded it, the idea of messianism, which is of central importance in Judaism and Christianity, is alien to Islam as represented by the Qur'an.\"\n\nThe Quran identifies Jesus as the messiah (Masih), who will one day return to earth. At the time of the second coming, \"according to Islamic tradition, Jesus will come again and exercise his power of healing. He will forever destroy falsehood, as embodied in the Daj-jal, the great falsifier, the anti-Christ. Then God will reign forever.\"\n\nThe Muslims refer to Jesus as \"Isa\". Jesus is one of the most important prophets in the Islamic tradition, along with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad. Unlike Christians, Muslims see Jesus as merely a prophet, but not as God Himself or the son of God. Like all other prophets, Jesus is an ordinary man, who receives revelations from God. According to religious scholar, Mona Siddiqui, in Islam, \"Prophecy allows God to remain veiled and there is no suggestion in the Qur'an that God wishes to reveal of himself just yet. Prophets guarantee interpretation of revelation and that God's message will be understood.\" Prophecy in human form does not represent the true powers of God, contrary to the way Jesus is depicted in mainstream Christianity.\n\nThe Quran states that Isa, the Son of Mariam (Arabic: Isa ibn Maryam), is the Messiah and Prophet sent to the Children of Israel. The birth of Isa is described Quran sura 19 verses 1–33, and sura 4 verse 171 explicitly states Isa as the Son of Mariam. Sunni Muslims believe Isa is alive in Heaven and did not die in the crucifixion, as depicted in mainstream Christianity. According to religious scholar, Mahmoud Ayoub, \"Jesus' close proximity or nearness (qurb) to God is affirmed in the Qur'anic insistence that Jesus did not die, but was taken up to God and remains with God (Q:3:54; 4:157) \" \n\nIt is believed that Isa will return to Earth to defeat the Masih ad-Dajjal (false Messiah), a figure similar to the Antichrist in Christianity, who will emerge shortly before Yawm al-Qiyāmah (\"the Day of Resurrection\"). The community leader (\"Mahdi\") will come shortly before the second coming of Jesus. After he has destroyed ad-Dajjal, his final task will be to become leader of the Muslims. Isa will unify the Muslim Ummah (the followers of Islam) under the common purpose of worshipping Allah alone in pure Islam, thereby ending divisions and deviations by adherents. Mainstream Muslims believe that at that time Isa will dispel Christian and Jewish claims about him.\n\nA hadith in Abu Dawud () says:\nNarrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Isa. He will descend (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height & reddish dusky complexion, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops of water were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill the swines ,and put an end to war (in another Tradition, there is the word Jizyah instead of Harb (war), meaning that he will abolish jizyah); God will perish all religions except Islam. He [Isa] will destroy the Antichrist who will live on the earth for forty days and then he will die. The Muslims will pray behind him.\n\nBoth Sunni and Shia Muslims agree that al-Mahdi will arrive first, and after him, Isa. Isa will proclaim al-Mahdi as the Islamic community leader. A war will be fought—the Dajjal against alMahdi and Isa. This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Isa slays alDajjāl at the Gate of Lud, he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is indeed the true and last word from God to humanity as Yusuf Ali's translation reads: \"And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them.\" A hadith in Sahih Bukhari () says:\nAllah's Apostle said \"How will you be when the son of Mariam descends among you and your Imam is from among you?\"\n\nThe Quran refutes the crucifixion of Jesus, claiming that he was neither killed nor crucified. The Quran also emphasizes the difference between Allah (God in Arabic) and the Messiah:\n\"Those who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary, are unbelievers. The Messiah said: \"O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord... unbelievers too are those who have said that Allah is the third of three... the Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger before whom other Messengers had gone.\"\n\nShia Islam\n\nShi'i Islam, which significantly values and revolves around the 12 spiritual leaders called Imams, differs significantly from the beliefs of Sunni Islam. Unlike Sunni Islam, \"Messianism is an essential part of religious belief and practice for almost all Shi'a Muslims.\"  Shi'i Islam believes that the last Imam will return again, with the return of Jesus. According to religious scholar, Mona Sidique, \"Shi'is are acutely aware of the existence everywhere of the twelfth Imam, who disappeared in 874. Shi'i piety teaches that the hidden Imam will return with Jesus Christ to set up the messianic kingdom before the final Judgement Day, when all humanity will stand before God. The Imams and Fatima will have a direct impact on the judgements rendered that day. This will represent the ultimate intercession.\"  There is debate on whether Shi'i Muslims should accept the death of Jesus. Religious scholar Mahmou Ayoub argues \"Modern Shi'i thinkers have allowed the possibility that Jesus died and only his spirit was taken up to heaven.\" Conversely, religious scholar Mona Siddiqui argues that Shi'i thinkers believe Jesus was \"neither crucified nor slain.\" She also argues that Shi'i Muslims believe that the twelfth imam did not die, but \"was taken to God to return in God's time,\"  and \"will return at the end of history to establish the kingdom of God on earth as the expected Mahdi.\"\n\nAhmadiyya\n\nIn Ahmadiyya theology, the terms \"Messiah\" and \"Mahdi\" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.[http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1599/my%E2%80%88claim-to-promised-messiahship/ Messiah and Mahdi - Review of Religions] The term \"Mahdi\" means guided by God, thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual.\nAccording to Ahmadiyya thought, Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering suffering for the sake of God instead of giving suffering (i.e. refraining from revenge). Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908)[http://www.askislam.org/concepts/prophecy_and_prophethood/question_577.html Ask Islam: What is the different between a messiah and a prophet? (audio)] among others.\n\nAhmadis hold that the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.\n\nNumerous hadith are presented by the Ahmadis in support of their view, such as one from Sunan Ibn Majah, which says, \"There is No Mahdi but Jesus son of Mary.\"Ibn Majah, Bab, Shahadatu-Zaman\n\nAhmadis believe that the prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. Unlike mainstream Muslims, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi. He also claimed to have appeared in the likeness of Krishna and that his advent fulfilled certain prophecies found in Hindu scriptures. Lecture Sialkot He stated that the founder of Sikhism was a Muslim saint, who was a reflection of the religious challenges he perceived to be occurring. Ghulam Ahmad wrote Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya, in 1880, which incorporated Indian, Sufi, Islamic and Western aspects in order to give life to Islam in the face of the British Raj, Protestant Christianity, and rising Hinduism. He later declared himself the Promised Messiah and the Mahdi following Divine revelations in 1891. Ghulam Ahmad argued that Jesus had appeared 1300 after the formation of the Muslim community and stressed the need for a current Messiah, in turn claiming that he himself embodied both the Mahdi and the Messiah. Ghulam Ahmad was supported by Muslims who especially felt oppressed by Christian and Hindu missionaries.\n\nOther traditions\n\n*In Buddhism, Maitreya is considered to the next Buddha (awakened one) that is promised to come. He is expected to come to renew the laws of Buddhism once the teaching of Gautama Buddha has completely decayed.\n*Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be the figure prophesied in the scriptures of the world's religions. His name, when translated literally, means \"The Glory of God\" in Arabic. According to the Baha'i faith, Bahá'u'lláh addressed not only those timeless theological and philosophical questions that have stayed with humanity since old times such as: Who is God? What is goodness? and Why are we here? but also the questions that have preoccupied philosophers of the 20th century: What motivates human nature? Is real peace indeed possible? Does God still care for humanity? and the like. He is considered to be the latest of the messengers that God sent to human beings. He is the one who brought new spiritual and social teachings for our modern age. He taught that there is only one God, that all of the world's religions are from God, and that now is the time for humanity to recognize its oneness and unite.\n*Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia is believed to be the Messiah by followers of the Rastafari movement. This idea further supports the belief that God himself is black, which they (followers of the Rastafarian movement) try to further strengthen by a verse from the Bible. . Even if the Emperor denied being the messiah, the followers of the Rastafari movement believe that he is a messenger from God. To justify this, Rastafarians used reasons such as Emperor Haile Selassie's bloodline, which is assumed to come from King Solomon of Israel, and the various titles given to him, which include Lord of Lords, King of Kings and Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah.\n*In Kebatinan (Javanese religious tradition), Satrio Piningit is a character in Jayabaya's prophecies who is destined to become a great leader of Nusantara and to rule the world from Java.

It is used throughout the Hebrew Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king, Jewish priests and prophets, the Jewish Temple and its utensils, unleavened bread, and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus king of Persia).Tanakh verses:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nIn Jewish eschatology, the term came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, to be king of God's kingdom, and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be God or a pre-existent divine Son of God. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as Messiah ben David, which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism. He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith.\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld idea in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. This happened once when Sabbatai Zevi, from Smirna (now İzmir, Turkey), claimed that he was the messiah that the Jewish community have been waiting for. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).\n\nA common modern rabbinic interpretation is that there is a potential messiah in every generation. The Talmud, which often uses stories to make a moral point (aggadah), tells of a highly respected rabbi who found the Messiah at the gates of Rome and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"\n\nA Kabbalistic tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace (Messiah ben David) will be preceded by Messiah ben Joseph, who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then Armilus, according to one group of sources, or Gog and Magog, according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.\n\nChabad \n\nYosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh Rebbe of Chabad,Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

He published about Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn to be \"Atzmus u'mehus alein vi er hat zich areingeshtalt in a guf\" (Yiddish and English for: \"Essence and Existence [of God] which has placed itself in a body\").Likutei Sichos, Vol 2, pp. 510-511. The gravesite of his deceased father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, known as \"the Ohel\", became a central point of focus for Menachem Mendel Schneerson's prayers and supplications.\n\nRegarding the deceased Menachem Mendel Schneerson, a later Chabad Halachic ruling claims that it was \"incumbent on every single Jew to heed the Rebbe's words and believe that he is indeed King Moshiach, who will be revealed imminently\". Outside of Chabad messianism, in Judaism, there is no basis to these claims. If anything, this resembles the faith in the resurrection of Jesus and his second coming in early Christianity.Freeman, Charles. The Closing of the Western Mind, p. 133. Vintage. 2002.\n\nStill today, the deceased rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson is believed to be the Messiah among adherents of the Chabad movement, and his second coming is believed to be imminent. He is venerated and invocated to by thousands of visitors and letters each year at the Ohel—especially in a pilgrimage each year on the anniversary of his death.The New York Observer, [http://observer.com/2014/07/rebbe-to-the-city-and-the-world/ \"Rebbe to the city and Rebbe to the world\"]. Editorial, 07/08/14.\n\nChristianity\n\nThe Greek translation of Messiah is khristos (), anglicized as Christ, and Christians commonly refer to Jesus as either the \"Christ\" or the \"Messiah\". Christians believe that Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission, death, and resurrection of Jesus and that he will return to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy.\n\nThe majority of historical and mainline Christian theologies consider Jesus to be the Son of God and God the Son, a concept of the Messiah fundamentally different from the Jewish and Islamic concepts. In each of the four New Testament Gospels, the only literal anointing of Jesus is conducted by a woman. In the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and John, this anointing occurs in Bethany, outside Jerusalem. In the Gospel of Luke, the anointing scene takes place at an indeterminate location, but context suggests it to be in Galilee, or even a separate anointing altogether.\n\nIslam\n\nWhile the term \"messiah\" does appear in Islam, the meaning is starkly different from that found in Christianity and Judaism. \"Though Islam shares many of the beliefs and characteristics of the two Semitic/Abrahamic/monotheistic religions which preceded it, the idea of messianism, which is of central importance in Judaism and Christianity, is alien to Islam as represented by the Qur'an.\"\n\nThe Quran identifies Jesus as the messiah (Masih), who will one day return to earth. At the time of the second coming, \"according to Islamic tradition, Jesus will come again and exercise his power of healing. He will forever destroy falsehood, as embodied in the Daj-jal, the great falsifier, the anti-Christ. Then God will reign forever.\"\n\nThe Muslims refer to Jesus as \"Isa\". Jesus is one of the most important prophets in the Islamic tradition, along with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad. Unlike Christians, Muslims see Jesus as merely a prophet, but not as God Himself or the son of God. Like all other prophets, Jesus is an ordinary man, who receives revelations from God. According to religious scholar, Mona Siddiqui, in Islam, \"Prophecy allows God to remain veiled and there is no suggestion in the Qur'an that God wishes to reveal of himself just yet. Prophets guarantee interpretation of revelation and that God's message will be understood.\" Prophecy in human form does not represent the true powers of God, contrary to the way Jesus is depicted in mainstream Christianity.\n\nThe Quran states that Isa, the Son of Mariam (Arabic: Isa ibn Maryam), is the Messiah and Prophet sent to the Children of Israel. The birth of Isa is described Quran sura 19 verses 1–33, and sura 4 verse 171 explicitly states Isa as the Son of Mariam. Sunni Muslims believe Isa is alive in Heaven and did not die in the crucifixion, as depicted in mainstream Christianity. According to religious scholar, Mahmoud Ayoub, \"Jesus' close proximity or nearness (qurb) to God is affirmed in the Qur'anic insistence that Jesus did not die, but was taken up to God and remains with God (Q:3:54; 4:157) \" \n\nIt is believed that Isa will return to Earth to defeat the Masih ad-Dajjal (false Messiah), a figure similar to the Antichrist in Christianity, who will emerge shortly before Yawm al-Qiyāmah (\"the Day of Resurrection\"). The community leader (\"Mahdi\") will come shortly before the second coming of Jesus. After he has destroyed ad-Dajjal, his final task will be to become leader of the Muslims. Isa will unify the Muslim Ummah (the followers of Islam) under the common purpose of worshipping Allah alone in pure Islam, thereby ending divisions and deviations by adherents. Mainstream Muslims believe that at that time Isa will dispel Christian and Jewish claims about him.\n\nA hadith in Abu Dawud () says:\nNarrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Isa. He will descend (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height & reddish dusky complexion, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops of water were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill the swines ,and put an end to war (in another Tradition, there is the word Jizyah instead of Harb (war), meaning that he will abolish jizyah); God will perish all religions except Islam. He [Isa] will destroy the Antichrist who will live on the earth for forty days and then he will die. The Muslims will pray behind him.\n\nBoth Sunni and Shia Muslims agree that al-Mahdi will arrive first, and after him, Isa. Isa will proclaim al-Mahdi as the Islamic community leader. A war will be fought—the Dajjal against alMahdi and Isa. This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Isa slays alDajjāl at the Gate of Lud, he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is indeed the true and last word from God to humanity as Yusuf Ali's translation reads: \"And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them.\" A hadith in Sahih Bukhari () says:\nAllah's Apostle said \"How will you be when the son of Mariam descends among you and your Imam is from among you?\"\n\nThe Quran refutes the crucifixion of Jesus, claiming that he was neither killed nor crucified. The Quran also emphasizes the difference between Allah (God in Arabic) and the Messiah:\n\"Those who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary, are unbelievers. The Messiah said: \"O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord... unbelievers too are those who have said that Allah is the third of three... the Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger before whom other Messengers had gone.\"\n\nShia Islam\n\nShi'i Islam, which significantly values and revolves around the 12 spiritual leaders called Imams, differs significantly from the beliefs of Sunni Islam. Unlike Sunni Islam, \"Messianism is an essential part of religious belief and practice for almost all Shi'a Muslims.\"  Shi'i Islam believes that the last Imam will return again, with the return of Jesus. According to religious scholar, Mona Sidique, \"Shi'is are acutely aware of the existence everywhere of the twelfth Imam, who disappeared in 874. Shi'i piety teaches that the hidden Imam will return with Jesus Christ to set up the messianic kingdom before the final Judgement Day, when all humanity will stand before God. The Imams and Fatima will have a direct impact on the judgements rendered that day. This will represent the ultimate intercession.\"  There is debate on whether Shi'i Muslims should accept the death of Jesus. Religious scholar Mahmou Ayoub argues \"Modern Shi'i thinkers have allowed the possibility that Jesus died and only his spirit was taken up to heaven.\" Conversely, religious scholar Mona Siddiqui argues that Shi'i thinkers believe Jesus was \"neither crucified nor slain.\" She also argues that Shi'i Muslims believe that the twelfth imam did not die, but \"was taken to God to return in God's time,\"  and \"will return at the end of history to establish the kingdom of God on earth as the expected Mahdi.\"\n\nAhmadiyya\n\nIn Ahmadiyya theology, the terms \"Messiah\" and \"Mahdi\" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.[http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1599/my%E2%80%88claim-to-promised-messiahship/ Messiah and Mahdi - Review of Religions] The term \"Mahdi\" means guided by God, thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual.\nAccording to Ahmadiyya thought, Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering suffering for the sake of God instead of giving suffering (i.e. refraining from revenge). Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908)[http://www.askislam.org/concepts/prophecy_and_prophethood/question_577.html Ask Islam: What is the different between a messiah and a prophet? (audio)] among others.\n\nAhmadis hold that the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.\n\nNumerous hadith are presented by the Ahmadis in support of their view, such as one from Sunan Ibn Majah, which says, \"There is No Mahdi but Jesus son of Mary.\"Ibn Majah, Bab, Shahadatu-Zaman\n\nAhmadis believe that the prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. Unlike mainstream Muslims, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi. He also claimed to have appeared in the likeness of Krishna and that his advent fulfilled certain prophecies found in Hindu scriptures. Lecture Sialkot He stated that the founder of Sikhism was a Muslim saint, who was a reflection of the religious challenges he perceived to be occurring. Ghulam Ahmad wrote Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya, in 1880, which incorporated Indian, Sufi, Islamic and Western aspects in order to give life to Islam in the face of the British Raj, Protestant Christianity, and rising Hinduism. He later declared himself the Promised Messiah and the Mahdi following Divine revelations in 1891. Ghulam Ahmad argued that Jesus had appeared 1300 after the formation of the Muslim community and stressed the need for a current Messiah, in turn claiming that he himself embodied both the Mahdi and the Messiah. Ghulam Ahmad was supported by Muslims who especially felt oppressed by Christian and Hindu missionaries.\n\nOther traditions\n\n*In Buddhism, Maitreya is considered to the next Buddha (awakened one) that is promised to come. He is expected to come to renew the laws of Buddhism once the teaching of Gautama Buddha has completely decayed.\n*Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be the figure prophesied in the scriptures of the world's religions. His name, when translated literally, means \"The Glory of God\" in Arabic. According to the Baha'i faith, Bahá'u'lláh addressed not only those timeless theological and philosophical questions that have stayed with humanity since old times such as: Who is God? What is goodness? and Why are we here? but also the questions that have preoccupied philosophers of the 20th century: What motivates human nature? Is real peace indeed possible? Does God still care for humanity? and the like. He is considered to be the latest of the messengers that God sent to human beings. He is the one who brought new spiritual and social teachings for our modern age. He taught that there is only one God, that all of the world's religions are from God, and that now is the time for humanity to recognize its oneness and unite.\n*Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia is believed to be the Messiah by followers of the Rastafari movement. This idea further supports the belief that God himself is black, which they (followers of the Rastafarian movement) try to further strengthen by a verse from the Bible. . Even if the Emperor denied being the messiah, the followers of the Rastafari movement believe that he is a messenger from God. To justify this, Rastafarians used reasons such as Emperor Haile Selassie's bloodline, which is assumed to come from King Solomon of Israel, and the various titles given to him, which include Lord of Lords, King of Kings and Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah.\n*In Kebatinan (Javanese religious tradition), Satrio Piningit is a character in Jayabaya's prophecies who is destined to become a great leader of Nusantara and to rule the world from Java.
