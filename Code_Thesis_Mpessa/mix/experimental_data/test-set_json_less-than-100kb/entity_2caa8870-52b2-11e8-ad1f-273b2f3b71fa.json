  "textBody" : "In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.\n\n#The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.\n#A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.Bryant, Jeff; Pavlyk, Oleksandr. \"[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/KeplersSecondLaw/ Kepler's Second Law]\", Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Retrieved December 27, 2009.\n#The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nMost planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. Calculations of the orbit of Mars, whose published values are somewhat suspect,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/after-400-years-a-challenge-to-kepler-he-fabricated-his-data-scholar-says.html?pagewanted=1 indicated an elliptical orbit. From this, Johannes Kepler inferred that other bodies in the Solar System, including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.\n\nKepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus, explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with epicycles.\n\nIsaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good approximation, as a consequence of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.\n\nComparison to Copernicus\n\nKepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:\n#The planetary orbit is a circle\n#The Sun is at the center of the orbit\n#The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant\n\nThe eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus'.\n\nKepler's corrections are not at all obvious:\n#The planetary orbit is not a circle, but an ellipse.\n#The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit.\n#Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the area speed is constant.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the equator of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\n\\varepsilon\\approx\\frac \\pi 4 \\frac {186-179}{186+179}\\approx 0.015,\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).\nThe calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.\n\nNomenclature\n\nIt took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of \"laws\".Voltaire, Eléments de la philosophie de Newton [Elements of Newton's Philosophy] (London, England: 1738).

Mawman, 1804).\n\nFurther, the current usage of \"Kepler's Second Law\" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two versions, related in a qualitative sense: the \"distance law\" and the \"area law.\" The \"area law\" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.\n\nHistory\n\nJohannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.In his Astronomia nova, Kepler presented only a proof that Mars' orbit is elliptical.  Evidence that the other known planets' orbits are elliptical was presented only in 1621.\nSee:  Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up p. 285.]  After having rejected circular and oval orbits, Kepler concluded that Mars' orbit must be elliptical.  From the top of page 285:  \"Ergo ellipsis est Planetæ iter; … \" (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; … )  Later on the same page:  \" … ut sequenti capite patescet:  ubi simul etiam demonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte ellipticam; … \" ( … as will be revealed in the next chapter:  where it will also then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be relinquished, except a perfect ellipse; … )  And then:  \"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \" (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … )  The geometric proof that Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages 289–290.\nKepler stated that every planet travels in elliptical orbits having the Sun at one focus in:  Johannes Kepler,  Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, part 1, III.  De Figura Orbitæ (III.  On the figure [i.e., shape] of orbits), [https://books.google.com/books?idwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg\nPA658#vonepage&q&f\nfalse pages 658–665.]  From p. 658:  \"Ellipsin fieri orbitam planetæ … \" (Of an ellipse is made a planet's orbit … ).  From p. 659:  \" … Sole (Foco altero huius ellipsis) … \" ( … the Sun (the other focus of this ellipse) … ).In his Astronomia nova ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form.  He did that only in his Epitome of 1621.  Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the \"distance law\" and the \"area law\".\n*  His \"distance law\" is presented in:  \"Caput XXXII.  Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte.\" (Chapter 32.  The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.)  See:  Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/164/mode/2up pp. 165–167.]  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/166/mode/2up On page 167], Kepler states:  \" … , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε.\" ( … , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.)  That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times.  However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.\n*  His \"area law\" is presented in:  \"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \" (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ), Protheorema XIV and XV, [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up pp. 291–295.]  On the top p. 294, it reads:   \"Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM.\"  (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.)  In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it.  Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc.  Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nIn 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet:  Johannes Kepler, Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [https://books.google.com/books?idwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg\nPA668#vonepage&q&f\ntrue page 668].  From page 668:  \"Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas æquales:  accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in proportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem.\"  (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun.)  That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun.  (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.) Kepler's third law was published in 1619.Johannes Kepler, Harmonices Mundi [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nZLlCAAAAcAAJ&pgPA189#v\nonepage&q&f=false p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  \"Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis mediarum distantiarum, … \"  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, … \")\nAn English translation of Kepler's Harmonices Mundi is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J. Aiton, A.M. Duncan, and J.V. Field, trans., The Harmony of the World (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  American Philosophical Society, 1997); see especially [https://books.google.com/books?idrEkLAAAAIAAJ&pg\nPA411#vonepage&q&f\nfalse p. 411]. Notably, Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the solar system, which called for circular orbits, but could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit (Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercuryhttp://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/planets_table.html). His first law reflected this discovery.\n\nKepler in 1621 and Godefroy Wendelin in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter.Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits, showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law.  See:  Joanne Baptista Riccioli, Almagestum novum … (Bologna (Bononia), (Italy):  Victor Benati, 1651), volume 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n_mJDAAAAcAAJ&pgPA492#v\nonepage&q&ffalse page 492 Scholia III.]  In the margin beside the relevant paragraph is printed: Vendelini ingeniosa speculatio circa motus & intervalla satellitum Jovis.  (Wendelin's clever speculation about the movement and distances of Jupiter's satellites.)In 1621, Johannes Kepler had noted that Jupiter's moons obey (approximately) his third law in his Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Epitome of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (“Lentiis ad Danubium“), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pgPA554#v\nonepage&q&f=false page 554]. The second law, in the \"area law\" form, was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his Philosophical Transactions were in its favour. As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted. The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published.\n\nNewton is credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does via rotational symmetry for the second law.\n\nFormulary\n\nThe mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further calculations.\n\nFirst law of Kepler\n\nMathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:\nr=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon\\, \\cos\\theta},\nwhere  p is the semi-latus rectum, ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse, r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So (r, θ) are polar coordinates.\n\nFor an ellipse 0 r_\\min=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon}\n\nAt θ 90° and at θ \n 270° the distance is equal to p.\n\nAt θ = 180°, aphelion,  the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is – invariably – perihelion plus 180°)\nr_{\\max}=\\frac{p}{1-\\varepsilon}\n\nThe semi-major axis a is the arithmetic mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\,r_{\\max} - a=a-r_{\\min}\n  \na=\\frac{p}{1-\\varepsilon^2}\n\nThe semi-minor axis b is the geometric mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\frac{r_\\max} b =\\frac b{r_\\min}\n\nb=\\frac p{\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}}\n\nThe semi-latus rectum p is the harmonic mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\frac{1}{r_\\min}-\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{1}{p}-\\frac{1}{r_\\max}\n\npar_\\max r_\\min\nb^2\\,\n\nThe eccentricity ε is the coefficient of variation between rmin and rmax:\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{r_{\\max}-r_{\\min}}{r_{\\max}+r_{\\min}}.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is\nA=\\pi a b\\,.\nThe special case of a circle is ε 0, resulting in r \n p  rmin \n rmax a \n b and A = πr2.\n\nSecond law of Kepler\n\nThe orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the sun, then slower when farther from the sun. Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.\n\nIn a small time dt\\, the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line r\\, and height r \\, d\\theta and area\ndA=\\tfrac 1 2\\cdot r\\cdot r d\\theta and so the constant areal velocity is \n\\frac{dA}{dt}=\\tfrac{1}{2}r^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}.\n\nThe area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is\n\\pi ab.\\,\nSo the period\nP\\,\nsatisfies\nP\\cdot \\tfrac 12r^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}=\\pi a b\nand the mean motion of the planet around the Sun\nn = 2\\pi/P \nsatisfies\nr^2 \\, d\\theta = a b n \\,dt .\n\nThird law of Kepler \n\nThis captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.\n\nKepler enunciated in 1619 this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the \"music of the spheres\" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.Burtt, Edwin. The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science. p. 52.\nSo it was known as the harmonic law.\n\nUsing Newton's Law of gravitation (published 1687), this relation can be found in the case of a circular orbit by setting the centripetal force equal to the gravitational force:\n\nm r \\omega^2 = G \\frac{m M}{r^2}\n\nThen, expressing the angular velocity in terms of the orbital period and then rearranging, we find Kepler's Third Law:\n\nm r \\bigg(\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\bigg)^2 G \\frac{m M}{r^2} \\rightarrow T^2 \n \\bigg ( \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{GM} \\bigg) r^3 \\rightarrow  T^2 \\propto r^3 \n\nA more detailed derivation can be done with general elliptical orbits as well as the center of mass. This results in replacing a circular radius, r, with the elliptical semi-major axis, a, as well as replacing the large mass M with M+m. However, with planet masses being so much smaller than the sun, this correction is often ignored. The full corresponding formula is:\n\\frac{T^2}{a^3} \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M+m)}\\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{GM} \n  7.495*10^{-6}{\\bigg [}{\\frac {\\rm AU^{3}}{\\rm days^{2}}}{\\bigg ]} = \\mathrm{constant}\nwhere M is the mass of the sun, m is the mass of the planet, and G is the gravitational constant, T is the orbital period and a is the elliptical semi-major axis. \n\nThe following table shows the data used by Kepler to empirically derive his law: \n\nUpon finding this pattern Kepler wrote:\n\nFor comparison, here are modern estimates:\n\nPlanetary acceleration\n\nIsaac Newton computed in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.\n#The direction of the acceleration is towards the Sun.\n#The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the inverse square law).\n\nThis implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets. However, Newton states in his Principia that he considers forces from a mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby taking an instrumentalist view.I. Newton, Principia, p. 408 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.I. Newton, Principia, p. 943 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman\n\nNewton defined the force acting on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration (see Newton's laws of motion). So:\n#Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.\n#The force acting on a planet is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the Sun.\n\nThe Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n#All bodies in the solar system attract one another.\n#The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.\n\nAs the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see two-body problem).\n\nBelow comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.\n\nAcceleration vector\n\nFrom the heliocentric point of view consider the vector to the planet \\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}  where  r is the distance to the planet and  \\hat {\\mathbf{r}}  is a unit vector pointing towards the planet. \n \\frac{d\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{dt}\\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \n \\dot\\theta  \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta},\\qquad  \\frac{d\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}}{dt}\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}} \n -\\dot\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\nwhere \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta} is the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}, and \\theta is the polar angle, and where a dot on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.\n\nDifferentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} =\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}\n=\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}},\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} \n= (\\ddot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} +\\dot{r} \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} )\n+ (\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + r\\ddot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n+ r\\dot{\\theta} \\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}})\n= (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}.\nSo\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = a_r \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}+a_\\theta\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\nwhere the radial acceleration is\na_r=\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2\nand the transversal acceleration is\na_\\theta=r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}.\n\nThe inverse square law\n\nKepler's second law says that\nr^2\\dot \\theta = nab  \nis constant.\n\nThe transversal acceleration a_\\theta is zero:\n\\frac{d (r^2 \\dot \\theta)}{dt} r (2 \\dot r \\dot \\theta + r \\ddot \\theta ) \n r a_\\theta = 0. \nSo the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.\n\nThe radial acceleration a_r   is\na_r \\ddot r - r \\dot \\theta^2\n \\ddot r - r \\left(\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n\\right)^2= \\ddot r -\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^3}. \nKepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:\n\\frac{p}{r} = 1+ \\varepsilon \\cos\\theta.\nDifferentiating with respect to time\n-\\frac{p\\dot r}{r^2} = -\\varepsilon  \\sin \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta \nor\np\\dot r = nab\\,\\varepsilon\\sin \\theta. \nDifferentiating once more\np\\ddot r =nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta\n=nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n=\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta . \nThe radial acceleration a_r   satisfies\np a_r = \\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta  - p\\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^3}\n= \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta - \\frac{p}{r}\\right). \nSubstituting the equation of the ellipse gives\np a_r \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\frac p r - 1 - \\frac p r\\right)\n -\\frac{n^2a^2}{r^2}b^2. \nThe relation b^2=pa gives the simple final result\na_r=-\\frac{n^2a^3}{r^2}. \nThis means that the acceleration vector \\mathbf{\\ddot r} of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the inverse square law\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r} = - \\frac{\\alpha}{r^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\nwhere\n\\alpha = n^2 a^3\\,\nis a constant, and \\hat{\\mathbf r} is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and r\\, is the distance between the planet and the Sun.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, \\alpha has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.\n\nThe inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit.\n\nNewton's law of gravitation\n\nBy Newton's second law, the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:\n\n\\mathbf{F} m_\\text{planet} \\mathbf{\\ddot r} \n - m_\\text{planet} \\alpha r^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n\nwhere m_\\text{planet} is the mass of the planet and \\alpha has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to Newton's third Law, the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun, m_\\text{Sun}. So\n\n\\alpha = Gm_\\text{Sun}\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe acceleration of solar system body number i is, according to Newton's laws:\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r_i} = G\\sum_{j\\ne i} m_j r_{ij}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij} \nwhere m_j  is the mass of body j, r_{ij}  is the distance between body i and body j, \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}  is the unit vector from body i towards body j, and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides i itself.\n\nIn the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes\n\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}\n\nwhich is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIf the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}\nSo in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIn the three-body case the accelerations are\n\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Sun} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}} \n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}+ G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}\n\nThese accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the three-body problem is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is the basis for perturbation calculations. See Lunar theory.\n\nPosition as a function of time \n\nKepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation.\n\nThe procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (r,θ) of a planet as a function of the time t since perihelion, is the following four steps:\n\n1. Compute the mean anomaly M = nt where n is the mean motion.\n:n\\cdot P=2\\pi radians where P is the period.\n2. Compute the eccentric anomaly E by solving Kepler's equation:\n:\\ M=E-\\varepsilon \\sin E\n3.

Compute the heliocentric distance\n:r=a(1-\\varepsilon \\cos E). \n\nThe important special case of circular orbit, ε  0, gives θ \n E = M. Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be normal, a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly.\n\nThe proof of this procedure is shown below.\n\nMean anomaly, M\n\nThe Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:\ns the Sun (at one focus of ellipse);\nz the perihelion\nc the center of the ellipse\np the planet\nand\n\\ a=|cz|, distance between center and perihelion, the semimajor axis,\n\\ \\varepsilon=",

    "aggregatedText" : "In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.\n\n#The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.\n#A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.Bryant, Jeff; Pavlyk, Oleksandr. \"[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/KeplersSecondLaw/ Kepler's Second Law]\", Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Retrieved December 27, 2009.\n#The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nMost planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. Calculations of the orbit of Mars, whose published values are somewhat suspect,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/after-400-years-a-challenge-to-kepler-he-fabricated-his-data-scholar-says.html?pagewanted=1 indicated an elliptical orbit. From this, Johannes Kepler inferred that other bodies in the Solar System, including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.\n\nKepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus, explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with epicycles.\n\nIsaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good approximation, as a consequence of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.\n\nComparison to Copernicus\n\nKepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:\n#The planetary orbit is a circle\n#The Sun is at the center of the orbit\n#The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant\n\nThe eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus'.\n\nKepler's corrections are not at all obvious:\n#The planetary orbit is not a circle, but an ellipse.\n#The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit.\n#Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the area speed is constant.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the equator of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\n\\varepsilon\\approx\\frac \\pi 4 \\frac {186-179}{186+179}\\approx 0.015,\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).\nThe calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.\n\nNomenclature\n\nIt took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of \"laws\".Voltaire, Eléments de la philosophie de Newton [Elements of Newton's Philosophy] (London, England: 1738).

Mawman, 1804).\n\nFurther, the current usage of \"Kepler's Second Law\" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two versions, related in a qualitative sense: the \"distance law\" and the \"area law.\" The \"area law\" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.\n\nHistory\n\nJohannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.In his Astronomia nova, Kepler presented only a proof that Mars' orbit is elliptical.  Evidence that the other known planets' orbits are elliptical was presented only in 1621.\nSee:  Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up p. 285.]  After having rejected circular and oval orbits, Kepler concluded that Mars' orbit must be elliptical.  From the top of page 285:  \"Ergo ellipsis est Planetæ iter; … \" (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; … )  Later on the same page:  \" … ut sequenti capite patescet:  ubi simul etiam demonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte ellipticam; … \" ( … as will be revealed in the next chapter:  where it will also then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be relinquished, except a perfect ellipse; … )  And then:  \"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \" (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … )  The geometric proof that Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages 289–290.\nKepler stated that every planet travels in elliptical orbits having the Sun at one focus in:  Johannes Kepler,  Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, part 1, III.  De Figura Orbitæ (III.  On the figure [i.e., shape] of orbits), [https://books.google.com/books?idwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg\nPA658#vonepage&q&f\nfalse pages 658–665.]  From p. 658:  \"Ellipsin fieri orbitam planetæ … \" (Of an ellipse is made a planet's orbit … ).  From p. 659:  \" … Sole (Foco altero huius ellipsis) … \" ( … the Sun (the other focus of this ellipse) … ).In his Astronomia nova ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form.  He did that only in his Epitome of 1621.  Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the \"distance law\" and the \"area law\".\n*  His \"distance law\" is presented in:  \"Caput XXXII.  Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte.\" (Chapter 32.  The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.)  See:  Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/164/mode/2up pp. 165–167.]  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/166/mode/2up On page 167], Kepler states:  \" … , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε.\" ( … , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.)  That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times.  However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.\n*  His \"area law\" is presented in:  \"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \" (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ), Protheorema XIV and XV, [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up pp. 291–295.]  On the top p. 294, it reads:   \"Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM.\"  (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.)  In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it.  Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc.  Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nIn 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet:  Johannes Kepler, Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [https://books.google.com/books?idwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg\nPA668#vonepage&q&f\ntrue page 668].  From page 668:  \"Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas æquales:  accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in proportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem.\"  (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun.)  That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun.  (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.) Kepler's third law was published in 1619.Johannes Kepler, Harmonices Mundi [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nZLlCAAAAcAAJ&pgPA189#v\nonepage&q&f=false p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  \"Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis mediarum distantiarum, … \"  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, … \")\nAn English translation of Kepler's Harmonices Mundi is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J. Aiton, A.M. Duncan, and J.V. Field, trans., The Harmony of the World (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  American Philosophical Society, 1997); see especially [https://books.google.com/books?idrEkLAAAAIAAJ&pg\nPA411#vonepage&q&f\nfalse p. 411]. Notably, Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the solar system, which called for circular orbits, but could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit (Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercuryhttp://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/planets_table.html). His first law reflected this discovery.\n\nKepler in 1621 and Godefroy Wendelin in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter.Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits, showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law.  See:  Joanne Baptista Riccioli, Almagestum novum … (Bologna (Bononia), (Italy):  Victor Benati, 1651), volume 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n_mJDAAAAcAAJ&pgPA492#v\nonepage&q&ffalse page 492 Scholia III.]  In the margin beside the relevant paragraph is printed: Vendelini ingeniosa speculatio circa motus & intervalla satellitum Jovis.  (Wendelin's clever speculation about the movement and distances of Jupiter's satellites.)In 1621, Johannes Kepler had noted that Jupiter's moons obey (approximately) his third law in his Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Epitome of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (“Lentiis ad Danubium“), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nwa2SE_6ZL7YC&pgPA554#v\nonepage&q&f=false page 554]. The second law, in the \"area law\" form, was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his Philosophical Transactions were in its favour. As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted. The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published.\n\nNewton is credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does via rotational symmetry for the second law.\n\nFormulary\n\nThe mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further calculations.\n\nFirst law of Kepler\n\nMathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:\nr=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon\\, \\cos\\theta},\nwhere  p is the semi-latus rectum, ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse, r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So (r, θ) are polar coordinates.\n\nFor an ellipse 0 r_\\min=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon}\n\nAt θ 90° and at θ \n 270° the distance is equal to p.\n\nAt θ = 180°, aphelion,  the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is – invariably – perihelion plus 180°)\nr_{\\max}=\\frac{p}{1-\\varepsilon}\n\nThe semi-major axis a is the arithmetic mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\,r_{\\max} - a=a-r_{\\min}\n  \na=\\frac{p}{1-\\varepsilon^2}\n\nThe semi-minor axis b is the geometric mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\frac{r_\\max} b =\\frac b{r_\\min}\n\nb=\\frac p{\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}}\n\nThe semi-latus rectum p is the harmonic mean between rmin and rmax:\n\\frac{1}{r_\\min}-\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{1}{p}-\\frac{1}{r_\\max}\n\npar_\\max r_\\min\nb^2\\,\n\nThe eccentricity ε is the coefficient of variation between rmin and rmax:\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{r_{\\max}-r_{\\min}}{r_{\\max}+r_{\\min}}.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is\nA=\\pi a b\\,.\nThe special case of a circle is ε 0, resulting in r \n p  rmin \n rmax a \n b and A = πr2.\n\nSecond law of Kepler\n\nThe orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the sun, then slower when farther from the sun. Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.\n\nIn a small time dt\\, the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line r\\, and height r \\, d\\theta and area\ndA=\\tfrac 1 2\\cdot r\\cdot r d\\theta and so the constant areal velocity is \n\\frac{dA}{dt}=\\tfrac{1}{2}r^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}.\n\nThe area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is\n\\pi ab.\\,\nSo the period\nP\\,\nsatisfies\nP\\cdot \\tfrac 12r^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}=\\pi a b\nand the mean motion of the planet around the Sun\nn = 2\\pi/P \nsatisfies\nr^2 \\, d\\theta = a b n \\,dt .\n\nThird law of Kepler \n\nThis captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.\n\nKepler enunciated in 1619 this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the \"music of the spheres\" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.Burtt, Edwin. The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science. p. 52.\nSo it was known as the harmonic law.\n\nUsing Newton's Law of gravitation (published 1687), this relation can be found in the case of a circular orbit by setting the centripetal force equal to the gravitational force:\n\nm r \\omega^2 = G \\frac{m M}{r^2}\n\nThen, expressing the angular velocity in terms of the orbital period and then rearranging, we find Kepler's Third Law:\n\nm r \\bigg(\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\bigg)^2 G \\frac{m M}{r^2} \\rightarrow T^2 \n \\bigg ( \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{GM} \\bigg) r^3 \\rightarrow  T^2 \\propto r^3 \n\nA more detailed derivation can be done with general elliptical orbits as well as the center of mass. This results in replacing a circular radius, r, with the elliptical semi-major axis, a, as well as replacing the large mass M with M+m. However, with planet masses being so much smaller than the sun, this correction is often ignored. The full corresponding formula is:\n\\frac{T^2}{a^3} \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M+m)}\\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{GM} \n  7.495*10^{-6}{\\bigg [}{\\frac {\\rm AU^{3}}{\\rm days^{2}}}{\\bigg ]} = \\mathrm{constant}\nwhere M is the mass of the sun, m is the mass of the planet, and G is the gravitational constant, T is the orbital period and a is the elliptical semi-major axis. \n\nThe following table shows the data used by Kepler to empirically derive his law: \n\nUpon finding this pattern Kepler wrote:\n\nFor comparison, here are modern estimates:\n\nPlanetary acceleration\n\nIsaac Newton computed in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.\n#The direction of the acceleration is towards the Sun.\n#The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the inverse square law).\n\nThis implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets. However, Newton states in his Principia that he considers forces from a mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby taking an instrumentalist view.I. Newton, Principia, p. 408 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.I. Newton, Principia, p. 943 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman\n\nNewton defined the force acting on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration (see Newton's laws of motion). So:\n#Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.\n#The force acting on a planet is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the Sun.\n\nThe Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n#All bodies in the solar system attract one another.\n#The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.\n\nAs the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see two-body problem).\n\nBelow comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.\n\nAcceleration vector\n\nFrom the heliocentric point of view consider the vector to the planet \\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}  where  r is the distance to the planet and  \\hat {\\mathbf{r}}  is a unit vector pointing towards the planet. \n \\frac{d\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{dt}\\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \n \\dot\\theta  \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta},\\qquad  \\frac{d\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}}{dt}\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}} \n -\\dot\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\nwhere \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta} is the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}, and \\theta is the polar angle, and where a dot on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.\n\nDifferentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} =\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}\n=\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}},\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} \n= (\\ddot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} +\\dot{r} \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} )\n+ (\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + r\\ddot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n+ r\\dot{\\theta} \\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}})\n= (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}.\nSo\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = a_r \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}+a_\\theta\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\nwhere the radial acceleration is\na_r=\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2\nand the transversal acceleration is\na_\\theta=r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}.\n\nThe inverse square law\n\nKepler's second law says that\nr^2\\dot \\theta = nab  \nis constant.\n\nThe transversal acceleration a_\\theta is zero:\n\\frac{d (r^2 \\dot \\theta)}{dt} r (2 \\dot r \\dot \\theta + r \\ddot \\theta ) \n r a_\\theta = 0. \nSo the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.\n\nThe radial acceleration a_r   is\na_r \\ddot r - r \\dot \\theta^2\n \\ddot r - r \\left(\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n\\right)^2= \\ddot r -\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^3}. \nKepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:\n\\frac{p}{r} = 1+ \\varepsilon \\cos\\theta.\nDifferentiating with respect to time\n-\\frac{p\\dot r}{r^2} = -\\varepsilon  \\sin \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta \nor\np\\dot r = nab\\,\\varepsilon\\sin \\theta. \nDifferentiating once more\np\\ddot r =nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta\n=nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n=\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta . \nThe radial acceleration a_r   satisfies\np a_r = \\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta  - p\\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^3}\n= \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta - \\frac{p}{r}\\right). \nSubstituting the equation of the ellipse gives\np a_r \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\frac p r - 1 - \\frac p r\\right)\n -\\frac{n^2a^2}{r^2}b^2. \nThe relation b^2=pa gives the simple final result\na_r=-\\frac{n^2a^3}{r^2}. \nThis means that the acceleration vector \\mathbf{\\ddot r} of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the inverse square law\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r} = - \\frac{\\alpha}{r^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\nwhere\n\\alpha = n^2 a^3\\,\nis a constant, and \\hat{\\mathbf r} is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and r\\, is the distance between the planet and the Sun.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, \\alpha has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.\n\nThe inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit.\n\nNewton's law of gravitation\n\nBy Newton's second law, the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:\n\n\\mathbf{F} m_\\text{planet} \\mathbf{\\ddot r} \n - m_\\text{planet} \\alpha r^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n\nwhere m_\\text{planet} is the mass of the planet and \\alpha has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to Newton's third Law, the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun, m_\\text{Sun}. So\n\n\\alpha = Gm_\\text{Sun}\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe acceleration of solar system body number i is, according to Newton's laws:\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r_i} = G\\sum_{j\\ne i} m_j r_{ij}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij} \nwhere m_j  is the mass of body j, r_{ij}  is the distance between body i and body j, \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}  is the unit vector from body i towards body j, and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides i itself.\n\nIn the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes\n\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}\n\nwhich is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIf the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}\nSo in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIn the three-body case the accelerations are\n\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Sun} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}} \n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}+ G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}\n\nThese accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the three-body problem is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is the basis for perturbation calculations. See Lunar theory.\n\nPosition as a function of time \n\nKepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation.\n\nThe procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (r,θ) of a planet as a function of the time t since perihelion, is the following four steps:\n\n1. Compute the mean anomaly M = nt where n is the mean motion.\n:n\\cdot P=2\\pi radians where P is the period.\n2. Compute the eccentric anomaly E by solving Kepler's equation:\n:\\ M=E-\\varepsilon \\sin E\n3. Compute the true anomaly θ by the equation:\n:(1-\\varepsilon) \\tan^2\\frac \\theta 2 = (1+\\varepsilon) \\tan^2\\frac E 2\n4. Compute the heliocentric distance\n:r=a(1-\\varepsilon \\cos E). \n\nThe important special case of circular orbit, ε  0, gives θ \n E = M. Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be normal, a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly.\n\nThe proof of this procedure is shown below.\n\nMean anomaly, M\n\nThe Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:\ns the Sun (at one focus of ellipse);\nz the perihelion\nc the center of the ellipse\np the planet\nand\n\\ a=|cz|, distance between center and perihelion, the semimajor axis,\n\\ \\varepsilon=.
