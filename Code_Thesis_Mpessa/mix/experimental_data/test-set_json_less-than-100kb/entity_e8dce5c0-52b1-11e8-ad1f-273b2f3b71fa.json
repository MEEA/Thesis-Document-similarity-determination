  "textBody" : "In English, the words Daoism and Taoism ( or) are alternative romanized spellings for the native Chinese philosophy/ religion of taoism. The root Chinese word 道 \"way, path\" was romanized tao in the earliest systems of Romanization and dào in 20th century systems including Pinyin. \n\nRomanizations of 道\n\nRomanization systems use one of two arbitrary ways to represent the Chinese phonemic opposition between aspirated and unaspirated consonants. Take for example, Chinese unaspirated  道 \"way\" and aspirated 桃 \"peach\". Some systems, like Wade–Giles tao 道 and t'ao 桃, introduce a special symbol for aspiration; others, like Pinyin dao 道 and tao 桃, use \"d\" and \"t\". In English and other languages, \"d\" and \"t\" indicate a voiced and unvoiced distinction, which is not phonemic in Chinese.\n\nMost English speakers think the Chinese pronunciation sounds more like an English initial than an English initial because the Chinese pronunciation is unaspirated.  Dao is in that sense more accurate than Tao. \n\nAn early European account of Taoism was provided by the Jesuits Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault in their De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas (1615).
