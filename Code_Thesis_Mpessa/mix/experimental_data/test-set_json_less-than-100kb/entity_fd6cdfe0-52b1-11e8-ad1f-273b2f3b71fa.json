Meijer escaped and lived in Paraguay for years, until he was discovered by Peter R. de Vries and imprisoned there. In 2003, Meijer halted resisting his extradition to the Netherlands, and was transferred to a Dutch prison to serve the last part of his term.  \n\nThe films The Heineken Kidnapping (2011) and Kidnapping Freddy Heineken (2015) are based on this incident.\n\nPersonal\n\nHeineken married Lucille Cummins, an American from a Kentucky family of bourbon whiskey distillers.
