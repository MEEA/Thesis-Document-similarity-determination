It is located at Kastrup, 8 km south-east of central Copenhagen. It is connected by train to Copenhagen Central Station and beyond as well as to Malmö and other towns in Sweden.\n\nFor the west of the country, the major airport is Billund (3m passengers in 2016) although both  Aalborg (1.4m passengers in 2011) and Aarhus (591.000 passengers in 2011) have smaller airports with regular connections to Copenhagen.\n\nList of airports \n\nDenmark's main airports are:\n\n* Copenhagen Airport (CPH), Scandinavia's busiest passenger airport located at Kastrup to the south-east of Copenhagen city and handling over 29 million passengers a year.\n* Billund Airport (BLL), in central Jutland, one of Denmark's busiest cargo centres as well as a popular charter airline destination and an airport for regular flights serving 3 million passengers a year, mainly from the western part of the country.\n* Aalborg Airport (AAL), located 5 km northwest of Aalborg, is Denmark's third busiest airport serving around 1,4 million passengers a year in connections with 25 European destinations and one of Europes busiest domestic lines to Copenhagen.\n* Aarhus Airport (AAH), located 39 km northeast of Århus, serves some 540,000 passengers a year.\n\nOther airports include: \n* Karup Airport (KRP) near Viborg in the west of Jutland, mainly serving Copenhagen with some 200,000 passengers a year.\n* Bornholm Airport (RNN) 5 km from the centre of Rønne in the southwest of the island of Bornholm, with several regular flights to Copenhagen a day.\n* Esbjerg Airport (EBJ), a small airport in the west of Jutland with regular flights to Aberdeen and Stavanger (although primarily serving North Sea Oilrigs).\n* Sønderborg Airport (SGD), in the very south of Jutland with connections to Copenhagen.\n* Roskilde Airport (RKE), 7 km southeast of Roskilde and some 38 km southwest of Copenhagen, serves mainly airtaxi and private business traffic.\n\nSea\n\nBeing an island state with a long coastline and always close to the sea, maritime transport has always been important in Denmark. From the primitive dugouts of the Stone Age to the complex designs of the Viking ships in the Viking Age, often built to exactly facilitate large scale cargo and passenger transportation. Denmark also engaged in the large scale cargo freights and slave transports of the European colonization endeavours in the Middle Ages and operated several smaller colonies of its own across the globe by the means of seafaring.\n\nToday Denmark's ports handle some 48 million passengers and 109 million tonnes of cargo per year.[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTableSKIB101&PLanguage\n1&PXSId=0 Call of vessels, passengers and throughput of goods in traffic ports by seaport and unit.] Statistics Denmark.

Some short ferry routes are being electrified and several more  may be eligible, as in Norway.\n\nAmong the most important ports for passenger traffic (thousands of passengers per year in 2007) are:\n* Helsingør 10,967\n* Rødbyhavn 7,058\n* Frederikshavn 2,894\n* Sjællands Odde 2,233\n* Esbjerg 1,827\n* Gedser 1,612\n* Aarhus 1,583\n* Rønne 1,522\n* Ebeltoft 962\n* Copenhagen 872\n\nIn 2007, 288 cruise ships visited Copenhagen, rising to 376 in 2011 before returning to around 300 the following years.

Especially the Gudenå river-system in central Jutland, has played an important role. The waterways were navigated by wooden barges and later on steamboats. A few historical steamboats are still in operation, like the SS Hjejlen from 1861 at Silkeborg.\n\nThere is a 160 km natural canal through the shallow Limfjorden in northern Jutland, linking the North Sea to the Kattegat.\n\nMany waterways has formerly been redirected and led through manmade canals in the 1900s, but mainly for agricultural purposes and not to facilitate transportation on any major scale.
