  "textBody" : "The James Tiptree Jr. Award is an annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's understanding of gender. It was initiated in February 1991 by science fiction authors Pat Murphy and Karen Joy Fowler, subsequent to a discussion at WisCon.\n\nIn addition to the award itself, the judges publish a \"Tiptree Award Honor List\" that they describe as \"a strong part of the award's identity and (...) used by many readers as a recommended reading list.\"\n\nBackground \n\nThe award is named for Alice B. Sheldon, who wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. By choosing a masculine nom de plume, having her stories accepted under that name and winning awards with them, Sheldon helped demonstrate that the division between male and female science fiction writing was illusory.  Years after \"Tiptree\" first published science fiction, Sheldon wrote some work under the female pen name \"Raccoona Sheldon\"; later, the science fiction world discovered that \"Tiptree\" had been female all along.  This discovery led to widespread discussion over which aspects of writing, if any, have an intrinsic gender.  To remind audiences of the role gender plays in both reading and writing, the award was named in Sheldon's honor at the suggestion of Karen Joy Fowler.\n\nFundraising efforts for the Tiptree include publications (two cookbooks), \"feminist bake sales\", and auctions. (The Tiptree cookbook The Bakery Men Don't See, edited by WisCon co-founder Jeanne Gomoll, was nominated for a 1992 Hugo Award.)
