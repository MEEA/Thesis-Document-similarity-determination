  "textBody" : "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Lawrence Rosen, OPEN SOURCE LICENSING, p.85 (Prentice Hall PTR, 1st ed. 2004) As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility. The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.\n\n, it was the most popular software license on GitHub, ahead of any GPL variant and other Free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses. Notable projects that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Ruby on Rails, Node.js, jQuery, and the X Window System.\n\nLicense terms \n\nA common form of the MIT License is this (taken from the Open Source Initiative's website; this is identical to the \"Expat License\", and different from the license used in the X source code):\n\nCopyright (c)  \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The \"MIT License\" published by the Open Source Initiative is the same as the \"Expat License\".\n\nThe X11 License and the \"MIT License\" chosen for ncurses by the Free Software Foundation both include the following clause, absent in the Expat License:\n\nComparison to other licenses\n\nThe original BSD license also includes a clause requiring all advertising of the software to display a notice crediting its authors. This \"advertising clause\" (since disavowed by UC Berkeley) is present in the modified MIT License used by XFree86.\n\nThe University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License combines text from both the MIT and BSD licenses; the license grant and disclaimer are taken from the MIT License.\n\nThe ISC license contains similarities to both the MIT and simplified BSD licenses, the biggest difference being that language deemed unnecessary by the Berne Convention is omitted.\n\nRelation to Patents\n\nLike the BSD license the MIT license does not include an express patent license. Both the BSD and the MIT licenses were drafted before the patentability of software was generally recognized under US law.Stern and Allen, Open Source Licensing, p. 495 in Understanding the Intellectual Property License 2013 (Practicing Law Institute 2013) A similarly permissive license, which includes an explicit contributor's patent license, is the Apache License version 2.0+.\nThe MIT license contains terms that are used in defining the rights of a patent holder in 35 U.S Code section 154 namely \"use\", and \"sell\". This has been construed by some commentators as an implicit license to use any underlying patents.Christian H. Nadan, Closing the Loophole; Open Source Licensing and the Implied Patent License, THE COMPUTER AND INTERNET LAWYER, Vol. 26, No. 8 (Aug. 2009) who argues that \"By using patent terms like \"deal in\", \"use\", and \"sell\", the MIT license grant is more likely to be deemed to include express patent rights than the BSD license.\"\n\nReception \n\n, according to Black Duck Software and GitHub, the MIT license was the most popular free software license, with the GNU GPLv2 coming second. In June 2016 an analysis of the Fedora Project's packages revealed the MIT as most used license.\n\nNotable projects that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Expat, an XML parser library; Ruby on Rails, a web application framework; Node.js, a web application runtime environment; jQuery, a JavaScript library; the Lua programming language; and the X Window System, for which the license was originally written. Microsoft's .NET Core framework is also published under [https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT MIT License] and the source code repository on GitHub includes the license for anyone visiting the resource.",
