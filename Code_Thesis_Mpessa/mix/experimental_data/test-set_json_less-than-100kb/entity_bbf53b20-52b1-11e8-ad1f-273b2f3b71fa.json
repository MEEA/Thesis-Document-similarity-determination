  "textBody" : "In linguistics, an  allomorph is a variant form of a morpheme, that is, when a unit of meaning varies in sound without changing meaning. The term allomorph explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes.\n\nAllomorphy in English suffixes\n\nEnglish has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning. Examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes.\n\nFor example, in English, a past tense morpheme is -ed.  It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a schwa when following an alveolar stop:\n\n*as or in verbs whose stem ends with the alveolar stops or, such as 'hunted' or 'banded'\n*as in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than, such as 'fished'\n*as in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than, such as 'buzzed'\n\nNotice the \"other than\" restrictions above. This is a common fact about allomorphy: if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, then the first matching case usually \"wins\".  Thus, the above conditions could be re-written as follows:\n\n*as or  when the stem ends with the alveolar stops or\n*as when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes\n*as elsewhere\n\nThe fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final, despite the fact that the latter is voiceless, is then explained by the fact that appears in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered. Likewise, the fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final is because the earlier clause for the allomorph takes priority; and the fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phonemes is because the preceding clause for the takes priority.\n\nIrregular past tense forms, such as \"broke\" or \"was/ were\", can be seen as still more specific cases (since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb \"break\"), which therefore take priority over the general cases listed above.\n\nStem allomorphy\n\nAllomorphy can also exist in stems or roots, as in Classical Sanskrit:\n\nThere are three allomorphs of the stem:, and.  The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes.\n\nThe form of the stem, found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of velars resulted in the variant form, which was initially phonologically conditioned.
