It is also a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo41526 Lithuania's Leadership of the OSCE: Hearing before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, First Session, 16 February 2011] NATO and its adjunct North Atlantic Coordinating Council, the Council of Europe, and the European Union. Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization on 31 May 2001.\n\nLithuania's membership in the EU\n\nOn 1 May 2004, Lithuania became one of the 28 Member States of the European Union. The EU activities affect different spheres of politics, from consumer rights to national defence matters. In the second half of 2013, Lithuania took presidency over the EU Council. Membership in the Union has strengthened the domestic economy, giving it access to the wide pan-European market. Foreign direct investments in Lithuania are growing. The country is poised to become energy-independent. The accession to the Schengen space in 2007 has opened up possibilities for the free movement of both citizens and goods across 25 European states. Lithuania's citizens enjoy equal social guarantees while working, travelling, or studying at the Community's countries. The country now benefits from additional EU fund and programme funding in the field of education and science. As an EU citizen, every citizen of Lithuania has the guarantee of consular assistance of EU representative offices in countries where Lithuania has none.http://urm.lt/default/lt/uzsienio-politika/uzsienio-politikos-prioritetai/lietuva-europos-sajungoje/lietuvos-naryste-es\n\nLithuania's membership in NATO\n\nOn 29 March 2004, Lithuania became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationhttp://www.nato.int/invitees2004/lithuania.htm It is a defensive union based on political and military cooperation of sovereign states. Its members are committed to protecting freedom, guarding shared heritage and civilisation under the principles of democracy, individual freedom, and superiority of law.

Five years later, Lithuania launched its mission to the organisation, and in late 2002, Lithuania and six other states was invited to start negotiations over membership in the Alliance. Today Lithuania sees NATO as the key and most effective collective defence system, one that ensures the security of the state and stands to defer potential aggression, and employs every measure available to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations to contribute to the strengthening of the EU-U.S. relations.http://urm.lt/default/lt/uzsienio-politika/uzsienio-politikos-prioritetai/lietuvos-saugumo-politika/nato\n\nLithuania's membership in the United Nations\n\nOn 17 September 1991, Lithuania became a member of the United Nations. This global international organisation has 193 states for its members. The United Nations Charter anchors the goals of the organisation, which are to maintain international peace and security, stop aggression under the principles of justice and international law, regulate or resolve international disputes. Lithuania's interests at the United Nations are presented by the permanent mission of the Republic of Lithuania in New York, the permanent mission to the United Nations office and other international organisations in Geneva, and the permanent mission to international organisations in Vienna. In 2013, Lithuania was elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and to the Security Council in February 014 and May 2015. In 2007, Lithuania presided over the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.\n\nLithuania in international and regional organisations\n\nCurrently, Lithuania is member to nearly 50 international cross-governmental organisations, joining many of them after it had regained its independence, and having its membership in inter-war organisations restored.

The 2011 presidency over the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe was also a success.\n\nLithuania–Poland relations\n\nLithuania and Poland have a long history of mutual relations: from a common state to the period when all diplomatic ties were cut. Currently, the Lithuania-Poland relations are excellent. Poland recognised Lithuania's independence on 26 August 1991, and the two countries entered into a diplomatic relationship on 5 August 1991. To promote cross-border relations, an agreement on friendly relations and good neighbourly cooperation between the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Polandhttps://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.11154 was signed on 26 April 1994. The agreement regulates the underlying principles that support the cooperation between the countries, waiving any territorial claims, and defines the rights of ethnic minorities. In February 1995, the first official visit of the Lithuania's president to Warsaw took place. To ensure a more efficient cooperation between the countries and to facilitate the implementation of bilateral projects, in 1997, three joint institutions – the Advisory Committee of the Presidents of Lithuania and Poland, the Lithuanian-Polish Interparliamentary Assembly, and the Lithuanian-Polish Council of Intergovernmental cooperation – were founded. Bilateral cooperation became very close and intensive with the election of Valdas Adamkus and Aleksander Kwaśniewski presidents of the two countries. Poland was an important ally to Lithuania in the country's bid to attain EU and NATO membership, both presidents acted as mediators during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the countries still agree on foreign political threats and the importance of energy independence. Later, there has been some tension in the relations due to the controversy over the situation with ethnic minorities and the disputes over the spelling of Polish personal and place names and Polish schools in Lithuania. Difficulties in education are a challenge that the Lithuanian minority in Puńsk and Sejny is facing. With the changes that occurred in the geopolitical situation of the region in 2016 and energy and transportation infrastructural projects underway, the relationship between Lithuania and Poland is recovering, Poland is actively involved in ensuring the security of the Batic region, its troops are continuously participating in NATO military training exercises in Lithuania.\n\nLithuania–Latvia relations\n\nThe diplomatic relations between Lithuania and Latvia date back to 1919.

This did not produce any significant results. After the two countries restored their statehood, their diplomatic relations were resumed on 5 October 1991, when an agreement on the reconstruction of the state border, promotion and protection of investments, air service, and other matters, was made.Žigaras F., Baltijos šalių institucinis bendradarbiavimas 1990–2010 m.
