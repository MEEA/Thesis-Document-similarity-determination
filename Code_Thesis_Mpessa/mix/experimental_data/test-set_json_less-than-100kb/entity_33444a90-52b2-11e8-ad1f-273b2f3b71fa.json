  "textBody" : "Latino ( or) is a term often used in the United States to refer to people with cultural ties to Latin America, in contrast to Hispanic which is a demonym that includes Spaniards and other speakers of the Spanish language.\"Latino: People with roots in the Spanish speaking Americas.  This term is sometimes used as a replacement for Hispanic.\n\n\"Latino\" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word latinoamericano (Latin American in English) or the Portuguese phrase latino americano, thus excluding speakers of Spanish or Portuguese from Europe. Both Hispanic and Latino are generally used to denote people living in the United States, so much so that \"Outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Colombians, Peruvians, and so forth.\" In Latin America, the term latino is not a common endonym and its usage in Spanish as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States.\n\nThe U.S. government's Office of Management and Budget has defined Hispanic or Latino people as being those who \"trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central, and South America (other than Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname), and other Spanish cultures\". The United States Census uses the ethnonym Hispanic or Latino to refer to \"a person of Dominican, Cuban,  Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race\". The Census Bureau also explains that \"[o]rigin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\"   Hence the U.S. Census and the OMB are using the terms differently. The U.S. Census and the OMB use the terms interchangeably, where both terms are synonyms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the term Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe AP Stylebooks recommended usage of Latino in Latin America includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons \"from — or whose ancestors were from — . . . Latin America, including Brazilians\". However, in the recent past, the term Latinos was also applied to people from the Caribbean region, including those from former Dutch and British colonies.\n\nEtymology\n\nIn English, the terms latino and latina are sometimes shortened forms of American Spanish \"latinoamericano\" and \"latinoamericana\" which are New World expansions of the Old World terms \"latino\" and \"latina\" which are ultimately from the Latin terms latīnus and latīna  meaning Latin. Latino The oldest use of the term Latino has been used in the United States since at least 1946 and means \"a Latin male in the United States\".  (Latin American).\n\nThe etymology of Latin America dates to the 19th century. French intellectuals postulated that this region of the Americas was inhabited by people of a \"Latin race\", and that it could, therefore, ally itself with \"Latin Europe\". The term was adopted since France, a great power at that time, had political ambitions in the region and cultural connections were established.\n\nIn Spanish, as used in Spain, the usage of latino is frequently not correlative to its primary usage in the United States. According to the Real Academia Española, the primary use of latino in Spanish is to refer to the people of the Lazio (Latium) region of Italy. The fifth definition listed is for the grouping of Romance language-speaking people of Europe and the Americas. Portuguese use and definitions of the word is similar. Its use is, therefore, more similar to the English adjective \"Latin\" (like in the case of describing \"Latin People\").\n\nUse in the United States\n\nThe term Latino was officially adopted in 1997 by the United States Government in the ethnonym Hispanic or Latino, which replaced the single term Hispanic: \"Because regional usage of the terms differs – Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion.\" (Boldface in the original.)\n\nU.S. official use of the term \"Hispanic\" has its origins in the 1970 census. The Census Bureau attempted to identify all Hispanics by use of the following criteria in sampled sets:\n\n* Spanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where Spanish was spoken\n* Persons with Spanish heritage by birth location\n* Persons who self-identify with Latin America, excluding Brazil\n\nNeither \"Hispanic\" nor \"Latino\" refers to a race, as a person of Latino/Hispanic ethnicity can be of any race. Like non-Latinos, a Latino can be of any race or combination of races: White/Caucasian, Black/African American, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander American, or two or more races. While Brazilian Americans are not included with Hispanics and Latinos in the government's census population reports, any Brazilian American can report as being Hispanic or Latino since Hispanic or Latino origin is, like race, a matter of self-identification.\n\nOther federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of Hispanic. The U.S. Department of Transportation defines Hispanic Americans as, \"persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race\".[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/download/module5.pdf  U.S. Department of Transportation], \"Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program Administration Reference Manual For Division Office Civil Rights Personnel\", Fhwa.dot.gov This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority owned businesses. \nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. Each year since 1997 the International Latino Book Award is conferred to the best achievements in Spanish or Portuguese literature at BookExpo America, the largest publishing trade show in the United States. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.\n\nSome authorities of American English maintain a distinction between the terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\":\n\nThough often used interchangeably in American English, Hispanic and Latino are not identical terms, and in certain contexts the choice between them can be significant. Hispanic, from the Latin word for \"Spain,\" has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that sometimes have little else in common. Latino—which in Spanish means \"Latin\" but which as an English word is probably a shortening of the Spanish word latinoamericano—refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American origin. Of the two, only Hispanic can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture; a native of Spain residing in the United States is a Hispanic, not a Latino, and one cannot substitute Latino in the phrase the Hispanic influence on native Mexican cultures without garbling the meaning. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can theoretically be called by either word.\n\nThe AP Stylebook also distinguishes between the terms Hispanic and Latino. The Stylebook limits the term \"Hispanic\" to  persons \"from - or whose ancestors were from - a Spanish-speaking land or culture\". It provides a more expansive definition, however, of the term \"Latino\". The Stylebook definition of Latino includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons \"from -- or whose ancestors were from -- . . . Latin America\".  The Stylebook specifically lists \"Brazilian\" as an example of a group which can be considered Latino.\n\nThere were 28 categories tabulated in the 2000 United States Census: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican Republic; Central American: Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Other Central American; South American: Argentinian, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, Other South American; Other Hispanic or Latino: Spaniard, Spanish, Spanish American, All other Hispanic or Latino.\n\nSimilar and related terms\n\nIn English, \"Latino\" is used interchangeably with \"Latin American\". As an English demonym \"Latin\" has other meanings:\n* an ancient Italic people entering the Italian peninsula around 1200 BCE\n* in ancient Rome an inhabitant of Old Latium (Latium vetus), later extended to New Latium (Latium adiectum) as well\n* a member of any population of the Roman Empire engaging in Roman culture and speaking Latin, regardless of their ethnicity\n* a member of the Latin Church, or Roman Catholic Church.\nAttempts have been made to introduce gender neutral language into Spanish by changing the ending of Latino. Terms like Latinx, Latin@, and Latine are just a few examples of the various ways in which members of the Latino community have tried to be more inclusive of women and gender nonbinary individuals through language.\n\nLatinx was first introduced in 2004 by members of the queer community online.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe use of the term Latino, despite its increasing popularity, is still highly debated among those who are called by the name. Since the adoption of the term by the U.S. Census BureauFisher, Celia B. and Lerner, Richard M. Encyclopedia of Applied Developmental Science\nSAGE, 2004,  Page  634\n and its subsequent widespread use, there have been several controversies and disagreements, especially in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. Since it is an arbitrary generic term, many Latin American scholars, journalists, and indigenous rights organisations have objected to the mass media use of the word \"Latino\", pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies, and identity politics of their supporters.Hispanic magazine, December 2000 Journalist Rodolfo Acuña writes:\n\nWhen and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella.  However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term Latino. They claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term Latino slights the various national identities included under the umbrella.Acuña, Rodolfo, U.S. Latino issues, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003",
