  "textBody" : "Count Francesco Algarotti (11 December 1712 – 3 May 1764) was an Venetian polymath, philosopher, poet, essayist, anglophile, art critic and art collector. He was \"one of the first Esprits cavaliers of the age,\" a man of broad knowledge, an expert in Newtonianism, architecture and music and a friend of most of the leading authors of his times: Voltaire, Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens, Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis and the atheist Julien Offray de La Mettrie. Lord Chesterfield, Thomas Gray, George Lyttelton, Thomas Hollis, Metastasio, Benedict XIV and Heinrich von Brühl were among his correspondents\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlgarotti was born in Venice as the son of a rich merchant. His father and uncle were art collectors. Unlike his older brother Bonomo he did not step into the company, but decided to become an author. Francesco studied natural sciences and mathematics  in Bologna under Francesco Maria Zanotti and in 1728 he experimented with optics. (Zanotti became a lifelong friend.) First he travelled in the North of Italy, but moved to Florence, and Rome. At the age of twenty, he went to Cirey and Paris, where he became friendly with Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet.In 1740 Voltaire called him the Venetian Socrates, may be his \"cher cygne de Padoue\" (\"dear swan of Padua\"). Two years later he was in London, where he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He  became embroiled in a lively bisexual love-triangle with the politician John Hervey, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.Rictor Norton, \"John, Lord Hervey: The Third Sex\", The Great Queens of History. Updated 8 August 2009 [http://rictornorton.co.uk/hervey.htm] Algarotti left for Italy and finished his Neutonianismo per le dame (\"Newtonism for Ladies\") (1737 - dedicated to Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle) - a work consisting of information on astronomy, physics, mathematics, women and science and education.\n\nIn the meantime Algarotti had made acquaintance with Antiochus Kantemir, a Moldavian diplomat, poet and composer.[https://books.google.nl/books?id6sFHnfb89A8C&lpg\nPA335&ots2qIYE2tWJg&dq\nAlgarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&pgPA335#v\nonepage&qAlgarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&f\nfalse  'By the Banks of the Neva': Chapters from the Lives and Careers of the ...
