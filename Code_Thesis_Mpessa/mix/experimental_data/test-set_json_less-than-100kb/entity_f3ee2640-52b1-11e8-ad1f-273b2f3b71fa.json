One of his generals was left in command of the capital. Presumably Shōmu feared Fujiwara supporters in Nara and was hoping to quell potential uprisings in other parts of the country with his presence. After four days travelling through heavy rain and thick mud, the party reached Kawaguchi on Tenpyō 12 11th month, 2nd day (25 November, 740) A couple of days later, they learn of Hirotsugu's execution and that the rebellion had been quelled.\n\nDespite the good news, Shōmu did not return to Heijō-kyō immediately, but stayed in Kawaguchi until Tenpyō 12 11th month, 11th day (4 December, 740). He continued his journey east, then north via Mino Province and back west along the shores of Lake Biwa to Kuni in Yamashiro Province (today in Kizugawa) which he reached on Tenpyō 12 12th month, 15th day (6 January, 741). Places passed along the way included Akasaka (赤坂頓宮; today Suzuka; 11th m. 14th d.: Dec 7）, Asake district (朝明郡; today Yokkaichi; 11th m. 20th d.: Dec 13）, Ishiura (石占頓宮; today Tado; 11th m. 25th d.: Dec 18）, Tagi district (当伎郡; today Yōrō; 11th m. 26th d.: Dec 19）, Fuwa (不破頓宮; today Tarui; 12th m. 1st d.: Dec 23）, Yokokawa (横川頓宮; today Santō or Maihara; 12th m. 6th d.: Dec 28), Inukami (犬上頓宮; today Hikone; 12th m. 7th d.: Dec 29）, Gamō district (蒲生郡; today near Yōkaichi; 12th m. 9th d.: Dec 31）, Yasu (野洲頓宮; today Yasu or Moriyama; 12th m. 10th d.: Jan 1）, Awazu (禾津頓宮; today Ōtsu; 12th m. 11th d.： Jan 2）, Tamanoi (玉井頓宮; today Yamashina-ku, Kyoto; 12th m. 14th d.）. Situated among the hills and near a river north of Nara, Kuni was easily defensible. In addition, the area was linked with the Minister of the Right, Tachibana no Moroe, while Nara was a center of the Fujiwara clan.

The more formal name for these \"bokubunniji\" was \"hokke-metuzai no tera\" (meaning \"nunneries for eliminating sin by means of the Lotus Sutra\").Varley, pp. 141–142.\n* 743 (Tenpyō 15): The Emperor issues a rescript to build the Daibutsu (Great Buddha), later to be completed and placed in Tōdai-ji, Nara.Varley, p. 141; Brown, p. 273.\n* 743 (Tenpyō 15): The law of Perpetual Ownership of Cultivated Lands (墾田永代私財法) issued\n* 744 (Tenpyō 16): In the spring, the court was moved to Naniwa-kyō which then became the new capital.\n* 745 (Tenpyō 17): The Emperor declares by himself Shigaraki-kyō the capital\n* 745 (Tenpyō 17): The capital returns to Heijō-kyō, construction of the Great Buddha resumes.\n* 749 (Tenpyō 21, 4th month): Shōmu, accompanied by the empress, their children, and all the great men and women of the court, went in procession to Todai-ji.

Empress Komyo, following her husband’s example, also took holy vows in becoming a Buddhist nun.\n* 752 (Tenpyō-shōhō 4, 4th month): The Eye-Opening Ceremony, presided over by Rōben and celebrating the completion of the Great Buddha, is held at  Tōdai-ji.Titsingh, ; Varley, p. 143.\n\nLegacy\n\nShōmu, a devout Buddhist, is best remembered for commissioning, in 743, the sixteen-meter high statue of the Vairocana Buddha (the Daibutsu) in Tōdai-ji of Nara. At the time, this was such a massive undertaking that later chroniclers accuse him of having completely exhausted the country's reserves of bronze and precious metals.  In 752, the Shōmu held the Eye-opening Ceremony of the Great Buddha.\n\nEarlier in 741, he established the system of provincial temples, making this the closest anyone ever came to declaring Japan a Buddhist nation.  In addition he commissioned the observance of the ohigan holiday for both spring and autumnal equinox.\n\nEmperor Shōmu died at age 56.\n\nThe actual site of Shōmu's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Shōmu's mausoleum.  It is formally named Sahoyama no minami no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 420.
