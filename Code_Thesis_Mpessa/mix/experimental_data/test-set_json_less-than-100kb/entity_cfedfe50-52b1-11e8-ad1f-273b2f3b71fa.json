  "textBody" : "Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and then generalized by Friedrich Bessel, are the canonical solutions  of Bessel's differential equation\nx^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\left(x^2 - \\alpha^2 \\right)y = 0\nfor an arbitrary complex number , the order of the Bessel function. Although  and  produce the same differential equation for real , it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of .\n\nThe most important cases are when  is an integer or half-integer.\nBessel functions for integer  are also known as cylinder functions or the cylindrical harmonics because they appear in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer  are obtained when the Helmholtz equation is solved in spherical coordinates.\n\nApplications of Bessel functions\n\nBessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (). For example:\n* Electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguide\n* Pressure amplitudes of inviscid rotational flows\n* Heat conduction in a cylindrical object\n* Modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) acoustic membrane (such as a drum or other membranophone)\n* Diffusion problems on a lattice\n* Solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation (in spherical and cylindrical coordinates) for a free particle\n* Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation\n* Frequency-dependent friction in circular pipelines\n* Dynamics of floating bodies\n* Angular resolution\n\nBessel functions also appear in other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see FM synthesis, Kaiser window, or Bessel filter).\n\nDefinitions\n\nBecause this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two linearly independent solutions. Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient. Different variations are summarized in the table below and described in the following sections.\n\nBessel functions of the second kind and the spherical Bessel functions of the second kind are sometimes denoted by  and  respectively, rather than  and .\n\nBessel functions of the first kind: \n\nBessel functions of the first kind, denoted as , are solutions of Bessel's differential equation that are finite at the origin () for integer or positive α and diverge as  approaches zero for negative non-integer . It is possible to define the function by its series expansion around , which can be found by applying the Frobenius method to Bessel's equation:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.10].\n\n J_\\alpha(x) \\sum_{m\n0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+\\alpha+1)} {\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}^{2m+\\alpha},\n\nwhere  is the gamma function, a shifted generalization of the factorial function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an entire function if  is an integer, otherwise it is a multivalued function with singularity at zero. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to  (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large . (The series indicates that  is the derivative of , much like  is the derivative of ; more generally, the derivative of  can be expressed in terms of  by the identities below.)\n\nFor non-integer , the functions  and  are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order , the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.5].\nJ_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_n(x).\n\nThis means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.\n\nBessel's integrals\n\nAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of , is possible using an integral representation:\nJ_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\cos (n \\tau - x \\sin \\tau) \\,d\\tau.\n\nAnother integral representation is:\nJ_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi e^{i(n \\tau - x \\sin \\tau)} \\,d\\tau.\n\nThis was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by one of Schläfli's integrals, for :Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nMlk3FrNoEVoC&pg=PA176 p. 176]http://www.nbi.dk/~polesen/borel/node15.htmlArfken & Weber, exercise 11.1.17.\n\nJ_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\cos(\\alpha\\tau - x \\sin\\tau)\\,d\\tau - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x \\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt. \n\nRelation to hypergeometric series\n\nThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric series asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_362.htm p. 362, 9.1.69].\nJ_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\;_0F_1 \\left(\\alpha+1; -\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right).\n\nThis expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the Bessel–Clifford function.\n\nRelation to Laguerre polynomials\n\nIn terms of the Laguerre polynomials  and arbitrarily chosen parameter , the Bessel function can be expressed as\n\\frac{J_\\alpha(x)}{\\left( \\frac{x}{2}\\right)^\\alpha} \\frac{e^{-t}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty \\frac{L_k^{(\\alpha)}\\left( \\frac{x^2}{4 t}\\right)}{\\binom{k+\\alpha}{k}} \\frac{t^k}{k!}.\n\nBessel functions of the second kind: \n\nThe Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by , occasionally denoted instead by , are solutions of the Bessel differential equation that have a singularity at the origin () and are multivalued. These are sometimes called Weber functions, as they were introduced by , and also Neumann functions after Carl Neumann.http://www.mhtlab.uwaterloo.ca/courses/me755/web_chap4.pdf\n\nFor non-integer ,  is related to  by\nY_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{J_\\alpha(x) \\cos \\alpha\\pi - J_{-\\alpha}(x)}{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}.\n\nIn the case of integer order , the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer  tends to :\nY_n(x) = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to n} Y_\\alpha(x).\nIf  is a nonnegative integer, we have the series[http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.8#E1 NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions], (10.8.1).

But  has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a \"natural\" partner of . See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.\n\nWhen  is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:\nY_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\n\nBoth  and  are holomorphic functions of  on the complex plane cut along the negative real axis. When  is an integer, the Bessel functions  are entire functions of . If  is held fixed at a non-zero value, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of .\n\nThe Bessel functions of the second kind when  is an integer is an example of the second kind of solution in Fuchs's theorem.\n\nHankel functions: , \n\nAnother important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel's equation are the Hankel functions of the first and second kind,  and , defined asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.3, 9.1.4].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= J_\\alpha(x) + iY_\\alpha(x), \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= J_\\alpha(x) - iY_\\alpha(x),\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere  is the imaginary unit. These linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel's differential equation. They are named after Hermann Hankel.\n\nThe importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, \"simple\" means an appearance of the factor of the form . The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.\n\nThe Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical-wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the sign convention for the frequency).\n\nUsing the previous relationships, they can be expressed as\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= \\frac{J_{-\\alpha}(x) - e^{-\\alpha \\pi i} J_\\alpha(x)}{i \\sin \\alpha\\pi}, \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= \\frac{J_{-\\alpha}(x) - e^{\\alpha \\pi i} J_\\alpha(x)}{- i \\sin \\alpha\\pi}.\n\\end{align}\n\nIf  is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether  is an integer or not:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.6].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_{-\\alpha}^{(1)}(x) &= e^{\\alpha \\pi i} H_\\alpha^{(1)} (x), \\\\\nH_{-\\alpha}^{(2)}(x) &= e^{-\\alpha \\pi i} H_\\alpha^{(2)} (x).\n\\end{align}\n\nIn particular, if  with  a nonnegative integer, the above relations imply directly that\n\n\\begin{align}\nJ_{-(m+\\frac{1}{2})}(x) &= (-1)^{m+1} Y_{m+\\frac{1}{2}}(x), \\\\\nY_{-(m+\\frac{1}{2})}(x) &= (-1)^m J_{m+\\frac{1}{2}}(x).\n\\end{align}\n\nThese are useful in developing the spherical Bessel functions (see below).\n\nThe Hankel functions admit the following integral representations for :Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.25].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty + i\\pi} e^{x\\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt, \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= -\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty - i\\pi} e^{x\\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt,\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere the integration limits indicate integration along a contour that can be chosen as follows: from  to 0 along the negative real axis, from 0 to  along the imaginary axis, and from  to  along a contour parallel to the real axis.\n\nModified Bessel functions: , \n\nThe Bessel functions are valid even for complex arguments , and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument. In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the modified Bessel functions (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind and are defined asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_375.htm p. 375, 9.6.2, 9.6.10, 9.6.11].\n\n\\begin{align}\nI_\\alpha(x) &i^{-\\alpha} J_\\alpha(ix) \n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m!\\, \\Gamma(m+\\alpha+1)}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+\\alpha}, \\\\\nK_\\alpha(x) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{I_{-\\alpha}(x) - I_\\alpha(x)}{\\sin \\alpha \\pi},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhen  is not an integer; when  is an integer, then the limit is used. These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments . The series expansion for  is thus similar to that for , but without the alternating  factor.\n\nIf ,  can be expressed as a Hankel function of the first kind:\nK_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} i^{\\alpha+1} H_\\alpha^{(1)}(ix),\nand if , it can be expressed as a Hankel function of the second kind:\nK_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (-i)^{\\alpha+1} H_\\alpha^{(2)}(-ix).\n\nWe can express the first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions (these are valid if ):\n\\begin{align}\nJ_\\alpha(iz) &= e^{\\frac{\\alpha i\\pi}{2}} I_\\alpha(z), \\\\\nY_\\alpha(iz) &= e^{\\frac{(\\alpha+1)i\\pi}{2}}I_\\alpha(z) - \\frac{2}{\\pi}e^{-\\frac{\\alpha i\\pi}{2}}K_\\alpha(z).\n\\end{align}\n\n and  are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel's equation:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_374.htm p. 374, 9.6.1].\nx^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\frac{dy}{dx} - \\left(x^2 + \\alpha^2 \\right)y = 0.\n\nUnlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument,  and  are exponentially growing and decaying functions respectively. Like the ordinary Bessel function , the function  goes to zero at  for  and is finite at  for . Analogously,  diverges at  with the singularity being of logarithmic type.\n\nTwo integral formulas for the modified Bessel functions are (for ):Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?idMlk3FrNoEVoC&pg\nPA181 p. 181].\n\n\\begin{align}\nI_\\alpha(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\pi e^{x\\cos \\theta} \\cos \\alpha\\theta \\,d\\theta - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x\\cosh t - \\alpha t} \\,dt, \\\\\nK_\\alpha(x) &= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x\\cosh t} \\cosh \\alpha t \\,dt.\n\\end{align}\n\nIn some calculations in physics, it can be useful to know that the following relation holds:\n\n2\\,K_0(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{\\sqrt{t^2+1}} \\,dt.\n\nIt can be proven by showing equality to the above integral definition for .

This differential equation, and the Riccati–Bessel solutions, also arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as Mie scattering after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004) for recent developments and references.\n\nFollowing Debye (1909), the notation ,  is sometimes used instead of , .\n\nAsymptotic forms\n\nThe Bessel functions have the following asymptotic forms.

However, for a given value of  one can write an equation containing a term of order :Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_364.htm p. 364, 9.2.1].\n\n\\begin{align}\nJ_\\alpha(z) &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi z}}\\left(\\cos \\left(z-\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + e^{\\left|\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\right|}\\mathrm{O}\\left(|z|^{-1}\\right)\\right) && \\text{for } \\left|\\arg z\\right| \n\n(For  the last terms in these formulas drop out completely; see the spherical Bessel functions above.)

Although  and  produce the same differential equation for real , it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of .\n\nThe most important cases are when  is an integer or half-integer.\nBessel functions for integer  are also known as cylinder functions or the cylindrical harmonics because they appear in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer  are obtained when the Helmholtz equation is solved in spherical coordinates.\n\nApplications of Bessel functions\n\nBessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (). For example:\n* Electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguide\n* Pressure amplitudes of inviscid rotational flows\n* Heat conduction in a cylindrical object\n* Modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) acoustic membrane (such as a drum or other membranophone)\n* Diffusion problems on a lattice\n* Solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation (in spherical and cylindrical coordinates) for a free particle\n* Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation\n* Frequency-dependent friction in circular pipelines\n* Dynamics of floating bodies\n* Angular resolution\n\nBessel functions also appear in other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see FM synthesis, Kaiser window, or Bessel filter).\n\nDefinitions\n\nBecause this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two linearly independent solutions. Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient. Different variations are summarized in the table below and described in the following sections.\n\nBessel functions of the second kind and the spherical Bessel functions of the second kind are sometimes denoted by  and  respectively, rather than  and .\n\nBessel functions of the first kind: \n\nBessel functions of the first kind, denoted as , are solutions of Bessel's differential equation that are finite at the origin () for integer or positive α and diverge as  approaches zero for negative non-integer . It is possible to define the function by its series expansion around , which can be found by applying the Frobenius method to Bessel's equation:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.10].\n\n J_\\alpha(x) \\sum_{m\n0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+\\alpha+1)} {\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}^{2m+\\alpha},\n\nwhere  is the gamma function, a shifted generalization of the factorial function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an entire function if  is an integer, otherwise it is a multivalued function with singularity at zero. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to  (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large . (The series indicates that  is the derivative of , much like  is the derivative of ; more generally, the derivative of  can be expressed in terms of  by the identities below.)\n\nFor non-integer , the functions  and  are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order , the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.5].\nJ_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_n(x).\n\nThis means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.\n\nBessel's integrals\n\nAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of , is possible using an integral representation:\nJ_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\cos (n \\tau - x \\sin \\tau) \\,d\\tau.\n\nAnother integral representation is:\nJ_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi e^{i(n \\tau - x \\sin \\tau)} \\,d\\tau.\n\nThis was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by one of Schläfli's integrals, for :Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nMlk3FrNoEVoC&pg=PA176 p. 176]http://www.nbi.dk/~polesen/borel/node15.htmlArfken & Weber, exercise 11.1.17.\n\nJ_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\cos(\\alpha\\tau - x \\sin\\tau)\\,d\\tau - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x \\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt. \n\nRelation to hypergeometric series\n\nThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric series asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_362.htm p. 362, 9.1.69].\nJ_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\;_0F_1 \\left(\\alpha+1; -\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right).\n\nThis expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the Bessel–Clifford function.\n\nRelation to Laguerre polynomials\n\nIn terms of the Laguerre polynomials  and arbitrarily chosen parameter , the Bessel function can be expressed as\n\\frac{J_\\alpha(x)}{\\left( \\frac{x}{2}\\right)^\\alpha} \\frac{e^{-t}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\sum_{k\n0}^\\infty \\frac{L_k^{(\\alpha)}\\left( \\frac{x^2}{4 t}\\right)}{\\binom{k+\\alpha}{k}} \\frac{t^k}{k!}.\n\nBessel functions of the second kind: \n\nThe Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by , occasionally denoted instead by , are solutions of the Bessel differential equation that have a singularity at the origin () and are multivalued. These are sometimes called Weber functions, as they were introduced by , and also Neumann functions after Carl Neumann.http://www.mhtlab.uwaterloo.ca/courses/me755/web_chap4.pdf\n\nFor non-integer ,  is related to  by\nY_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{J_\\alpha(x) \\cos \\alpha\\pi - J_{-\\alpha}(x)}{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}.\n\nIn the case of integer order , the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer  tends to :\nY_n(x) = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to n} Y_\\alpha(x).\nIf  is a nonnegative integer, we have the series[http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.8#E1 NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions], (10.8.1).

But  has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a \"natural\" partner of . See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.\n\nWhen  is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:\nY_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\n\nBoth  and  are holomorphic functions of  on the complex plane cut along the negative real axis. When  is an integer, the Bessel functions  are entire functions of . If  is held fixed at a non-zero value, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of .\n\nThe Bessel functions of the second kind when  is an integer is an example of the second kind of solution in Fuchs's theorem.\n\nHankel functions: , \n\nAnother important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel's equation are the Hankel functions of the first and second kind,  and , defined asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.3, 9.1.4].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= J_\\alpha(x) + iY_\\alpha(x), \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= J_\\alpha(x) - iY_\\alpha(x),\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere  is the imaginary unit. These linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel's differential equation. They are named after Hermann Hankel.\n\nThe importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, \"simple\" means an appearance of the factor of the form . The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.\n\nThe Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical-wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the sign convention for the frequency).\n\nUsing the previous relationships, they can be expressed as\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= \\frac{J_{-\\alpha}(x) - e^{-\\alpha \\pi i} J_\\alpha(x)}{i \\sin \\alpha\\pi}, \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= \\frac{J_{-\\alpha}(x) - e^{\\alpha \\pi i} J_\\alpha(x)}{- i \\sin \\alpha\\pi}.\n\\end{align}\n\nIf  is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether  is an integer or not:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.6].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_{-\\alpha}^{(1)}(x) &= e^{\\alpha \\pi i} H_\\alpha^{(1)} (x), \\\\\nH_{-\\alpha}^{(2)}(x) &= e^{-\\alpha \\pi i} H_\\alpha^{(2)} (x).\n\\end{align}\n\nIn particular, if  with  a nonnegative integer, the above relations imply directly that\n\n\\begin{align}\nJ_{-(m+\\frac{1}{2})}(x) &= (-1)^{m+1} Y_{m+\\frac{1}{2}}(x), \\\\\nY_{-(m+\\frac{1}{2})}(x) &= (-1)^m J_{m+\\frac{1}{2}}(x).\n\\end{align}\n\nThese are useful in developing the spherical Bessel functions (see below).\n\nThe Hankel functions admit the following integral representations for :Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.25].\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty + i\\pi} e^{x\\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt, \\\\\nH_\\alpha^{(2)}(x) &= -\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty - i\\pi} e^{x\\sinh t - \\alpha t} \\, dt,\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere the integration limits indicate integration along a contour that can be chosen as follows: from  to 0 along the negative real axis, from 0 to  along the imaginary axis, and from  to  along a contour parallel to the real axis.\n\nModified Bessel functions: , \n\nThe Bessel functions are valid even for complex arguments , and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument. In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the modified Bessel functions (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind and are defined asAbramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_375.htm p. 375, 9.6.2, 9.6.10, 9.6.11].\n\n\\begin{align}\nI_\\alpha(x) &i^{-\\alpha} J_\\alpha(ix) \n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m!\\, \\Gamma(m+\\alpha+1)}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+\\alpha}, \\\\\nK_\\alpha(x) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{I_{-\\alpha}(x) - I_\\alpha(x)}{\\sin \\alpha \\pi},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhen  is not an integer; when  is an integer, then the limit is used. These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments . The series expansion for  is thus similar to that for , but without the alternating  factor.\n\nIf ,  can be expressed as a Hankel function of the first kind:\nK_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} i^{\\alpha+1} H_\\alpha^{(1)}(ix),\nand if , it can be expressed as a Hankel function of the second kind:\nK_\\alpha(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (-i)^{\\alpha+1} H_\\alpha^{(2)}(-ix).\n\nWe can express the first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions (these are valid if ):\n\\begin{align}\nJ_\\alpha(iz) &= e^{\\frac{\\alpha i\\pi}{2}} I_\\alpha(z), \\\\\nY_\\alpha(iz) &= e^{\\frac{(\\alpha+1)i\\pi}{2}}I_\\alpha(z) - \\frac{2}{\\pi}e^{-\\frac{\\alpha i\\pi}{2}}K_\\alpha(z).\n\\end{align}\n\n and  are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel's equation:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_374.htm p. 374, 9.6.1].\nx^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\frac{dy}{dx} - \\left(x^2 + \\alpha^2 \\right)y = 0.\n\nUnlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument,  and  are exponentially growing and decaying functions respectively. Like the ordinary Bessel function , the function  goes to zero at  for  and is finite at  for . Analogously,  diverges at  with the singularity being of logarithmic type.\n\nTwo integral formulas for the modified Bessel functions are (for ):Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?idMlk3FrNoEVoC&pg\nPA181 p. 181].\n\n\\begin{align}\nI_\\alpha(x) &= \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\pi e^{x\\cos \\theta} \\cos \\alpha\\theta \\,d\\theta - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha\\pi}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x\\cosh t - \\alpha t} \\,dt, \\\\\nK_\\alpha(x) &= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x\\cosh t} \\cosh \\alpha t \\,dt.\n\\end{align}\n\nIn some calculations in physics, it can be useful to know that the following relation holds:\n\n2\\,K_0(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{\\sqrt{t^2+1}} \\,dt.\n\nIt can be proven by showing equality to the above integral definition for .

It follows, for example, that  and , and so on.\n\nThe spherical Hankel functions appear in problems involving spherical wave propagation, for example in the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field.\n\nRiccati–Bessel functions: , , , \n\nRiccati–Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:\n\n\\begin{align}\nS_n(x)&x j_n(x)&&\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi x}{2}} \\, J_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}(x)\\\\[5px]\nC_n(x)&-x y_n(x)&&\n-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi x}{2}} \\, Y_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}(x)\\\\[5px]\n\\xi_n(x) &x h_n^{(1)}(x)&&\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi x}{2}} \\, H_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}^{(1)}(x)&&=S_n(x)-iC_n(x)\\\\[5px]\n\\zeta_n(x)&x h_n^{(2)}(x)&&\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi x}{2}} \\, H_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}^{(2)}(x)&&=S_n(x)+iC_n(x)\n\\end{align}\n\nThey satisfy the differential equation:\n\nx^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + \\left(x^2 - n (n+1)\\right) y = 0\n\nFor example, this kind of differential equation appears in Quantum Mechanics while solving the radial component of the Schrödinger's Equation with hypothetical cylindrical infinite potential barrier. For reference see p. 154, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, 2nd Edition. This differential equation, and the Riccati–Bessel solutions, also arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as Mie scattering after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004) for recent developments and references.\n\nFollowing Debye (1909), the notation ,  is sometimes used instead of , .\n\nAsymptotic forms\n\nThe Bessel functions have the following asymptotic forms. For small arguments , one obtains, when  is not a negative integer:\n\nJ_\\alpha(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\left( \\frac{z}{2} \\right)^\\alpha.\n\nWhen  is a negative integer, we have\n\nJ_\\alpha(z) \\sim \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{(-\\alpha)!} \\left( \\frac{2}{z} \\right)^\\alpha.\n\nFor the Bessel function of the second kind we have three cases:\n\nY_\\alpha(z) \\sim \\begin{cases}\n \\dfrac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\ln \\left(\\dfrac{z}{2} \\right) + \\gamma \\right) & \\text{if } \\alpha = 0, \\\\\n -\\dfrac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{2}{z} \\right)^\\alpha + \\dfrac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)} \\left(\\dfrac{z}{2} \\right)^\\alpha \\cot(\\alpha \\pi) & \\text{if } \\alpha \\text{ is not a non-positive integer (one term dominates unless } \\alpha \\text{ is imaginary)}, \\\\\n -\\dfrac{(-1)^\\alpha\\Gamma(-\\alpha)}{\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{z}{2} \\right)^\\alpha & \\text{if } \\alpha\\text{ is a negative integer,}\n\\end{cases}\n\nwhere  is the Euler–Mascheroni constant (0.5772...).\n\nFor large real arguments , one cannot write a true asymptotic form for Bessel functions of the first and second kind (unless  is half-integer) because they have zeros all the way out to infinity, which would have to be matched exactly by any asymptotic expansion. However, for a given value of  one can write an equation containing a term of order :Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_364.htm p. 364, 9.2.1].\n\n\\begin{align}\nJ_\\alpha(z) &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi z}}\\left(\\cos \\left(z-\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + e^{\\left|\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\right|}\\mathrm{O}\\left(|z|^{-1}\\right)\\right) && \\text{for } \\left|\\arg z\\right| \n\n(For  the last terms in these formulas drop out completely; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Even though these equations are true, better approximations may be available for complex . For example,  when  is near the negative real line is approximated better by\n\nJ_0(z) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{-2}{\\pi z}}\\cos \\left(z+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n\nthan by\n\nJ_0(z) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi z}}\\cos \\left(z-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right).\n\nThe asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions are:\n\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\alpha^{(1)}(z) &\\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi z}}e^{i\\left(z-\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)} &&\\text{ for } {-\\pi} \n\nThese can be extended to other values of  using equations relating  and  to  and .NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, Section [http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.11#E1 10.11].\n\nIt is interesting that although the Bessel function of the first kind is the average of the two Hankel functions,  is not asymptotic to the average of these two asymptotic forms when  is negative (because one or the other will not be correct there, depending on the  used). But the asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions permit us to write asymptotic forms for the Bessel functions of first and second kinds for complex (non-real)  so long as  goes to infinity at a constant phase angle  (using the square root having positive real part):\n\n\\begin{align}\nJ_\\alpha(z) &\\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} e^{ i\\left(z-\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)} && \\text{ for } {-\\pi} \n\nFor the modified Bessel functions, Hankel developed asymptotic expansions as well:Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_377.htm p. 377, 9.7.1].Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_378.htm p. 378, 9.7.2].\n\n\\begin{align}\nI_\\alpha(z) &\\sim \\frac{e^z}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} \\left(1 - \\frac{4 \\alpha^2 - 1}{8z} + \\frac{\\left(4 \\alpha^2 - 1\\right) \\left(4 \\alpha^2 - 9\\right)}{2!
