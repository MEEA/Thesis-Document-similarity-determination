  "textBody" : "Modes of transport in Gabon include rail, road, water, and air. The one rail link, the Trans-Gabon Railway, connects the port of Owendo with the inland town of Franceville. Most but not all of the country is connected to the road network, much of which is unpaved, and which centres on seven \"national routes\" identified as N1 to N7. The largest seaports are Port-Gentil and the newer Owendo, and 1,600 km of inland waterways are navigable. There are three international airports, eight other paved airports, and over 40 with unpaved runways. Nearly 300km of pipelines carry petroleum products, mainly crude oil.\n\nRailways in Gabon \n\nUntil the 1970s, Gabon had no railroads. A 936 km railroad construction program, the Trans-Gabon Railway, began in October 1974. In its first stage, completed in 1983, the project linked the port of Owendo with the interior city of Booué (332 km). The second stage, completed in December 1986, linked Booué with Franceville (357 km) via Moanda, thus facilitating exports of manganese from the southeast and forestry exploitation in the same region. A proposed third stage would continue the line from Booué to Belinga in the northeast, where there are iron ore deposits. \n\nIn 2003, the railway began the process of installing a satellite based telecommunications system.[http://www.cellular.co.za/news_2003/100503-gabon_telecom_selects_hughes_net.htm Railway telecom system 2003] As of 2004, Gabon State Railways totalled 814 km of standard-gauge track.\n\ntotal: 814 km (Gabon State Railways or OCTRA)standard gauge: 814 km 1.435-m gauge; single track (1994)\n\nMaps \n\n* [https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/gabon.pdf UN Map - shows line to Franceville]\n* [http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tblPUBL&id\n441688290 UNHCR map - does not show line to Franceville]\n* [http://www.travelportal.info/go_frames.php?unid10174&linkid\n9179&newlanguage=english TravelPortal map - shows major rivers]\n* [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/BC0EF176D6BCADE385256C0800474100/$File/wfp_safr_rails0702.pdf?OpenElement UNJLC Rail map of Southern Africa - does not show line to Franceville]\n\nCities served by rail \n\n; Existing\n* Libreville - capital\n* Owendo - port\n* Sahoué - port\n* Franceville - railhead\n* Ndjolé\n* Lopé\n* Booué - likely junction for branchline to Makokou\n* Lastoursville\n* Moanda\n* Ntoum - proposed junction for iron ore traffic to Santa Clara\n* Kango\n* Four-Place\n* Mounana - ?\n\n;Proposed\n* Makokou - iron ore\n* Cape Santa Clara - proposed deep water port for Makokou iron ore.\n* Bélinga - possible iron ore mine.\n\n2007 \n\n* New rail line from Belinga will go 450 km all the way to the coast, rather than to be a branch off an existing line.[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3276107 Business Report - China given monopoly to work Gabon's untapped iron ore resources]\n* Pan-African issues[http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c1&i\n1301 Railway Corridors in Africa to be Connected]\n\n2006 \n\n* China signs a deal for an iron ore mine with associated rail and port upgrades from Belinga to Santa Clara [http://chinaconfidential.blogspot.com/2006/06/high-iron-ore-prices-push-china-to_12.html]\n[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-162298942.html]\n\nRoad transport \n\nMain roads connect virtually all major communities, but maintenance work is difficult because of heavy rainfall. In 2002, the road network comprised 8,454 km, of which 838 km\nwere paved, including 30 km of expressways. A north-south road runs the length of the country, from Bitam to Ndendé. This main north-south link continues into Cameroon in the north and the Congo in the south. An east–west road connects Libreville and Mékambo. Farther south, another road runs from Mayumba to Lastoursville and Franceville.
