  "textBody" : "The Cayman Islands are a British dependency and island country. It is a three-island archipelago in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman. Georgetown, the capital of the Cayman Islands is 438 km south of Havana, Cuba, and 504 km northwest of Kingston, Jamaica, northeast of Costa Rica, north of Panama and are between Cuba and Central America. Georgetown’s geographic coordinates are 19.300° north, 81.383° west.\n\nThe Cayman Islands have a land area of  approximately 1.5 times the size of Washington, D.C. and just 3 km² larger than Saint Kitts and Nevis. The Cayman Islands have a coastline of 160 km. The Cayman Islands make a maritime claim of a 200 nmi exclusive fishing zone and a territorial sea of 12 nmi.\n\nGeology\n\nThe islands are located on the Cayman Rise which forms the northern margin of the Cayman Trough. The trough is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern Cuba along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward Costa Rica and resulted from Paleocene to Eocene island arc formation with associated volcanism along an extinct subduction zone.[http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/165_SR/chap_20/chap_20.htm H.

Due to the Islands' location, the Cayman Islands do get earthquakes.\n\nClimate \n\nThe Cayman Islands have a tropical wet and dry climate, with a wet season from May to October, and a dry season that runs from November to April.

Drinking water supplies must be met by rainwater catchment and desalination. In addition there is also a problem with trash washing up on the beaches or being deposited by there by residents. The Cayman Islands have no recycling or waste treatment facilities.https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/10/04/1100-pounds-of-garbage-plucked-from-beach/\n\nNatural resources \n\nNatural resources include fish and a climate and beaches that foster tourism, which is the islands' major industry.
