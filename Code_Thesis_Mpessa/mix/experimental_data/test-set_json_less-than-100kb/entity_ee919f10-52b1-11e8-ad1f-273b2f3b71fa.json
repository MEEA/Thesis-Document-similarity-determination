If an absolute majority (50% + 1) is not achieved by any candidate in the first round of a presidential election, then a run-off pool election is conducted 30 days later between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round.

Twenty of the 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of a single national constituency.  The remaining 64 are elected in 14 multi-member constituencies (corresponding to El Salvador's 14 departments).
