Notable aspects of the system include its CPU configuration, I/O board with \"GeekPort\", and \"Blinkenlights\" on the front bezel.\n\nThe BeBox made its debut in October 1995 (BeBox Dual603-66). The processors were upgraded to 133 MHz in August 1996 (BeBox Dual603e-133). Production was halted in January 1997, following the port of BeOS to the Macintosh, in order for the company to concentrate on software.
