  "textBody" : "The Man Booker Prize for Fiction (formerly known as the Booker-McConnell Prize and commonly known simply as the Booker Prize) is a literary prize awarded each year for the best original novel written in the English language and published in the UK. The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade. From its inception, only Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, however, this eligibility was widened to any English-language novel—a change which proved controversial. In 2016 and 2017, the prize was won by writers from the United States.\t\n\nA high-profile literary award in British culture, the Booker Prize is greeted with great anticipation and fanfare. It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the shortlist or even to be nominated for the \"longlist\".\n\nHistory and administration\n\nThe prize was originally known as the Booker–McConnell Prize, after the company Booker, McConnell Ltd began sponsoring the event in 1968; it became commonly known as the \"Booker Prize\" or simply \"the Booker\".\n\nWhen administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company Man Group, which opted to retain \"Booker\" as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder. The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, and was subsequently raised to £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the world's richest literary prizes.\n\nIn 1970, Bernice Rubens became the first woman to win the Booker Prize, for The Elected Member.James Kidd, [http://www.scmp.com/article/539083/brief-history-man-booker-prize \"A Brief History of The Man Booker Prize\"], South China Morning Post, 5 March 2006. The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given. In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. The Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the \"Lost Man Booker Prize,\" with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970.\n\nAlice Munro's The Beggar Maid was shortlisted in 1980, and remains the only short story collection to be shortlisted.\n\nBefore 2001, each year's longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed.\n\nJohn Sutherland, who was a judge for the 1999 prize, has said, \n\nIn 1972, the winning writer John Berger, known for his Marxist worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker's 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region's modern poverty.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?votu4tjqrOk0 \"John Berger on the Booker Prize (1972)\"], YouTube. Berger donated half of his £5,000 prize to the British Black Panther movement, because they had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own. p. 11.[http://gostbustere.tumblr.com/post/17158444595/speech-by-john-berger-on-accepting-the-booker-prize-for Speech by John Berger on accepting the Booker Prize for Fiction] at the Café Royal in London on 23 November 1972.\n\nIn 1980, Anthony Burgess, writer of Earthly Powers, refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won. His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being Rites of Passage by William Golding. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize, and the dramatic \"literary battle\" between two senior writers made front page news. p. 1.\n\nJudging for the 1983 award produced a draw between J. M. Coetzee's Life & Times of Michael K and Salman Rushdie's Shame, leaving chair of judges Fay Weldon to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in The Guardian, \"Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie\" only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through.\n\nIn 1993, two of the judges threatened to walk out when Trainspotting appeared on the longlist; Irvine Welsh's novel was pulled from the shortlist to satisfy them. The novel would later receive critical acclaim, and is now considered Welsh's masterpiece.\n\nThe award has been criticised for the types of books it covers. In 1981, nominee John Banville wrote a letter to The Guardian requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, \"thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read — surely a unique occurrence.\"[http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref\nR1VBLzE5ODEvMTAvMTUjQXIwMTQwMg&Mode\nGif&Locale=english-skin-custom \"A novel way of striking a 12,000 Booker Prize bargain\"], The Guardian, 14 October 1981, p. 14.\nIn 1994, Guardian literary editor Richard Gott, citing the lack of objective criteria and the exclusion of American authors, described the prize as \"a significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise.\" p. 22.\n\nIn 1997, the decision to award Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things proved controversial. Carmen Callil, chair of the previous year's Booker judges, called it an \"execrable\" book and said on television that it shouldn't even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman Martyn Goff said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of Bernard MacLaverty's shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as \"a wonderful short-story writer and that Grace Notes was three short stories strung together.\"\n\nIn 2001, A. L. Kennedy, who was a judge in 1996, called the prize \"a pile of crooked nonsense\" with the winner determined by \"who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is\".\n\nThe Booker prized created a permanent home for the archives from 1968 to present at Oxford Brookes University Library. The Archive, which encompasses the administrative history of the Prize from 1968 to date, collects together a diverse range of material, including correspondence, publicity material, copies of both the Longlists and the Shortlists, minutes of meetings, photographs and material relating to the awards dinner (letters of invitation, guest lists, seating plans). Embargoes of ten or twenty years apply to certain categories of material; examples include all material relating to the judging process and the Longlist prior to 2002.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. \"Outsider\" John Banville began this trend in 2005 when his novel The Sea was selected as a surprise winner: Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of The Independent, famously condemned it as \"possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award\" and rival novelist Tibor Fischer poured scorn on Banville's victory. Kiran Desai of India won in 2006. Anne Enright's 2007 victory came about due to a jury badly split over Ian McEwan's novel On Chesil Beach. The following year it was India's turn again, with Aravind Adiga narrowly defeating Enright's fellow Irishman Sebastian Barry.\n\nHistorically, the winner of the Man Booker Prize had been required to be a citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. It was announced on 18 September 2013 that future Man Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in English and published in the UK.Will Gompertz, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24145501 \"Global expansion for Booker Prize\"], BBC News, 18 September 2013. This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner A. S. Byatt and former judge John Mullan said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change.  Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American Paul Beatty in 2016. Another American, George Saunders, won the following year.\n\nJudging\n\nThe selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the formation of an advisory committee, which includes a writer, two publishers, a literary agent, a bookseller, a librarian, and a chairperson appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation. The advisory committee then selects the judging panel, the membership of which changes each year, although on rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures.\n\nThe Booker judging process and the very concept of a \"best book\" being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many. The Guardian introduced the \"Not the Booker Prize\" voted for by readers partly as a reaction to this. \nAuthor Amit Chaudhuri wrote \"The idea that a “book of the year” can be assessed annually by a bunch of people – judges who have to read almost a book a day – is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer\".. \n\nThe winner is usually announced at a ceremony in London's Guildhall, usually in early October.\n\nWinners\n\nThe 2017 prize was awarded to George Saunders for Lincoln in the Bardo. \n\nIn 1993, to mark the prize's 25th anniversary, a \"Booker of Bookers\" Prize was given. Three previous judges of the award, Malcolm Bradbury, David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, the 1981 winner, as \"the best novel out of all the winners.\"\n\nSimilarly, The Best of the Booker was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again Midnight's Children.\n\nRelated awards\n\nA separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the Man Booker International Prize was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a £50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.\n\nA Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize, also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the Man Asian Literary Prize, an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\n\nAs part of The Times Literature Festival in Cheltenham, a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the Commonwealth are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country, beating Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter and Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was Ford Maddox Ford's The Good Soldier, beating The Thirty-Nine Steps (John Buchan), Of Human Bondage (Somerset Maugham), Psmith, Journalist (P. G. Wodehouse) and The Voyage Out (Virginia Woolf).[http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/blog/fords-the-good-soldier-wins-the-cheltenham-booker-1915-at-2015-festival \"Ford's The Good Soldier Wins The Cheltenham Booker 1915 at 2015 Festival\"].
