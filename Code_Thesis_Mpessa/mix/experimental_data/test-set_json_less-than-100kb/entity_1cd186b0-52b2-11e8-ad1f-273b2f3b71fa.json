These numerals are generally used in the context of the decimal Hindu–Arabic numeral system, and are distinct from, though related by descent to Arabic numerals.\n\nDevanagari\n\nBelow is a list of the Indian numerals in their modern Devanagari form, the corresponding Hindu-Arabic (European) equivalents, their Hindi and Sanskrit pronunciation, and translations in some languages.List of numbers in various languages\n\nSince Sanskrit is an Indo-European language, the words for numerals closely resemble those of Greek and Latin.
