  "textBody" : "The Family International (TFI) is a cult that started in 1968 in Huntington Beach, California, USA. It was originally called Teens for Christ and later gained notoriety as The Children of God (COG). It was later renamed and reorganized as The Family of Love, which was eventually shortened to The Family. It is currently called The Family International. It is infamous for advocating incest with minor-age children, including by one of its leaders, Karen Zerby.\n\nOverview\n\nTFI initially spread a message of salvation, apocalypticism, spiritual \"revolution and happiness\" and distrust of the outside world, which the members called The System. In 1976, it began a method of evangelism called Flirty Fishing, that used sex to \"show God's love and mercy\" and win converts, resulting in controversy. TFI's founder and prophetic leader, David Berg (who was first called \"Moses David\" in the Texas press), gave himself the titles of \"King\", \"The Last Endtime Prophet\", \"Moses\", and \"David\". He communicated with his followers via \"Mo Letters\"—letters of instruction and counsel on myriad spiritual and practical subjects—until his death in late 1994. After his death, his widow Karen Zerby became the leader of TFI, taking the titles of \"Queen\" and \"Prophetess\". She married Steve Kelly, an assistant of Berg's whom Berg had handpicked as her \"consort\". Kelly took the title of \"King Peter\" and became the face of TFI, speaking in public more often than either David Berg or Karen Zerby.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Children of God (1968–1977)\n\nMembers of The Children of God (COG) founded communes, first called colonies (now referred to as homes), in various cities. They would proselytize in the streets and distribute pamphlets. Leaders within COG were referred to as The Chain.\n\nThe founder of the movement, David Brandt Berg (1919–1994), was a former Christian and Missionary Alliance pastor.\n\nBerg communicated with his followers by writing letters. He published nearly 3,000 letters over a period of 24 years, referred to as the Mo Letters. In a letter written in January 1972, Berg stated that he was God's prophet for the contemporary world, attempting to further solidify his spiritual authority within the group. Berg's letters also contained public acknowledgement of his own failings and weaknesses.\n\nBy 1972, COG had 130 communities around the world. \n\nThe Children of God was abolished in February 1978. Berg reorganized the movement amid reports of serious misconduct, financial mismanagement, The Chain's abuse of authority, and disagreements within it about the continued use of Flirty Fishing. One-eighth of the total membership left the movement. Those who remained became part of a reorganized movement called the Family of Love, and later, The Family. The majority of the group's beliefs remained the same.\n\nThe Family of Love (1978–1981)\n\nThe Family of Love era was characterized by international expansion. \n\nIn 1976, before the dissolution of The Children of God, David Berg had introduced a new proselytizing method called Flirty Fishing (or FFing), which encouraged female members to \"show God's love\" through sexual relationships with potential converts. Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg's inner circle starting in 1973, and was introduced to the general membership in 1976 and became common practice within the group. In some areas flirty fishers used escort agencies to meet potential converts. According to TFI  \"over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary\" as a result of Flirty Fishing. Researcher Bill Bainbridge obtained data from TFI suggesting that, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.\n\nThe Family (1982–1994)\n\nIn March 1989, TF issued a statement that, in \"early 1985\", an urgent memorandum had been sent to all members \"reminding them that any such activities [adult–child sexual contact] are strictly forbidden within our group\" (emphasis in original), and such activities were grounds for immediate excommunication from the group. In January 2005, Claire Borowik, a spokesperson for TFI, stated that:[d]ue to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances ... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense.\n\nThe Family (1995–2003)\n\nAfter Berg's death in October 1994, Karen Zerby (known in the group as Mama Maria, Queen Maria, Maria David, or Maria Fontaine), assumed leadership of the group. \n\nIn February 1995, the group introduced the Love Charter, which defined the rights and responsibilities of Charter Members and Homes. The Charter also included the Fundamental Family Rules, a summary of rules and guidelines from past TF publications which were still in effect.\n\nIn the 1994–95 British court case, the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Alan Ward ruled that the group, including some of its top leaders, had in the past engaged in abusive sexual practices involving minors and had also used severe corporal punishment and sequestration of minors. He found that by 1995 TF had abandoned these practices and concluded that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg's writings that were \"responsible for children in TF having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour\".\n\nThe Family International (2004–present)\n\nThe Love Charter is The Family's set governing document that entails each member's rights, responsibilities and requirements, while the Missionary Member Statutes and Fellow Member Statutes were written for the governance of TFI's Missionary member and Fellow Member circles, respectively. FD Homes were reviewed every six months against a published set of criteria. The Love Charter increased the number of single family homes as well as homes that relied on jobs such as self-employment.\n\nRecent teachings\n\nTFI's recent teachings center around beliefs they term the \"new [spiritual] weapons\". TFI members believe that they are soldiers in the spiritual war of good versus evil for the souls and hearts of men.\n\nSpirit Helpers\n\nThese include angels, departed humans, other religious and mythical figures, and even celebrities; for example the goddess Aphrodite, the Snowman, Merlin, the Sphinx, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Richard Nixon, and Winston Churchill. \n\nThe Keys of the Kingdom\n\nTFI believes that the Biblical passage \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\" (), refers to an increased spiritual authority given to Peter and the early disciples. These keys were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were revealed again through Karen Zerby as additional power for praying and obtaining miracles. TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for extra effect during prayer. The Keys, like most TFI beliefs, were digested in comic-book magazines to help teach them to children. These beliefs are still generally held and practiced, even after the \"reboot\" documents of 2010.\n\nLoving Jesus\n\nThis is a term TFI members use to describe their intimate, sexual relationship with Jesus. TFI describes its \"Loving Jesus\" teaching as a radical form of bridal theology. They believe the church of followers is Christ's bride, called to love and serve him with wifely fervor. But they take bridal theology further, encouraging members to imagine Jesus is joining them during sexual intercourse and masturbation. Male members are cautioned to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus. Many TFI publications, and spirit messages claimed to be from Jesus himself, elaborate this intimate, sexual relation they believe Jesus desires and needs. TFI imagines itself as his special \"bride\" in graphic poetry, guided visualizations, artwork, and songs. Some TFI literature is not brought into conservative countries for fear it may be classified at customs as pornography. The literature outlining this view of Jesus and his desire for a sexual relationship with believers was edited for younger teens, then further edited for children.\n\nIssues\n\nThe second generation\n\nSecond-generation adults (known as \"SGAs\") are adults born or reared in TFI.\n\nAnti-TFI sentiment has been publicly expressed by some who have left the group; examples include sisters Celeste Jones, Kristina Jones, and Juliana Buhring, who wrote a book on their lives in TFI.\n\nSecrecy\n\nTFI members are expected to respect legal and civil authorities where they live. Members have typically cooperated with appointed authorities, even during the police and social-service raids of their communities in the early 1990s.\n\nReception\n\nThe group has been criticized by the press and the anti-cult movement. In 1971, an organization called FREECOG was founded by concerned parents and others, including deprogrammer Ted Patrick, to \"free\" members of the COG from their involvement in the group. Academics were divided, with some categorizing the TFI as a \"new religious movement\", and others, such as Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi and John Huxley, labeling the group a \"cult\".\n\nNotable members (past and present)\n\n*Jeremy Spencer, renowned blues slide guitarist and a founding member of Fleetwood Mac, which he left in 1971 when he joined TFI.\n\nRaised in COG as children\n\n* Christopher Owens: musician, of San Francisco indie band Girls, was brought up in TFI by his parents.\n*Celeste Jones and Kristina Jones: co-authors, along with Juliana Buhring, of Not Without My Sister, an autobiography detailing extensive abuse they suffered in COG.
