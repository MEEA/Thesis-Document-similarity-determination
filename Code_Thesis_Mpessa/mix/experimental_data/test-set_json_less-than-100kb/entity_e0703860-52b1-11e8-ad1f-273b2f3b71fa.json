  "textBody" : "In Greek mythology, Callisto or Kallisto (; ) was a nymph, or the daughter  of King Lycaon; the myth varies in such details.  She was one of the followers of Artemis, or Diana for the Romans, who attracted Zeus (Jupiter).  He transformed himself into the figure of Artemis and seduced her in this disguise.  She fell pregnant and this was eventually discovered and expelled from  Artemis's group, after which a furious Hera (Juno, wife of her seducer) transformed her into a bear.  Later, just as she was about to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was set among the stars as Ursa Major (\"the Great Bear\").  She was the bear-mother of the Arcadians, through her son Arcas.\n\nThe fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter is named after Callisto.\n\nGenealogy \n \nGenealogy\n\nMyth\n\nAs a follower of Artemis, Callisto, who Hesiod saidIn his lost Astronomy, quoted in Catasterismi. was the daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia,Other writers gave her a mortal genealogy as the daughter of one or the other of Lycaon's sons: Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke. took a vow to remain a virgin, as did all the nymphs of Artemis. But to have sex with her, Zeus disguised himself as Artemis (Diana) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a bear, as Hesiod described:\n\n...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas.\n\nEither Artemis \"slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,\"Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod, 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White). perhaps urged by the wrath of Juno (Hera)This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE (Pausanias, VIII.35.8). or later Arcas, the eponym of Arcadia, nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the forbidden precinct of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the constellations Ursa Major, called Arktos (αρκτος), the \"Bear\", by Greeks, and Ursa Minor.\n\nAccording to Ovid,Ovid. Metamorphoses. Book II, Lines 405–531; Ovid narrates the myth also in Fasti, book II. it was Jupiter (Zeus) who took the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.The transformation of Zeus, with its lesbian overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project – Kallisto]). Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when she saw that Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group.  Callisto later gave birth to Arcas. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as Ursa Major and Minor, respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to Tethys that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their circumpolar positions in ancient times (see below).\n\nIn art\n\nCallisto's story was sometimes depicted in classical art, where the moment of transformation into a bear was the most popular.Gods  From the Renaissance on a series of major history paintings as well as many smaller cabinet paintings and book illustrations, usually called \"Diana and Callisto\", depicted the traumatic moment of discovery of the pregnancy, as the goddess and her nymphs bathed in a pool, following Ovid's account.  The subject's attraction was undoubtedly mainly the opportunity it offered for a group of several females to be shown largely nude.There is a good but by no means complete, selection at [http://iconographic.warburg.sas.ac.uk/vpc/VPC_search/subcats.php?cat_15&cat_2\n244&cat_32345&cat_4\n3995 Warburg Institute Iconographic Database, Myths → Callisto's pregnancy discovered by Diana]; more on Wikimedia Commons \n\nTitian's Diana and Callisto (1556-1559), was the greatest (though not the first) of these, quickly disseminated by a print by Cornelius Cort.Brigstocke, 184  Here, as in most subsequent depictions, Diana points angrily, as Callisto is held by two nymphs, who may be pulling off what little clothing remains on her.  Other versions include one by Rubens, and Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto by Rembrandt, which unusually combines the moment with the arrival of Actaeon.Hall, Gods  The basic composition is rather unusually consistent.  Carlo Ridolfi said there was a version by Giorgione, who died in 1510, though his many attributions to Giorgione of paintings that are now lost are treated with suspicion by scholars.Jane Martineau (ed), The Genius of Venice, 1500–1600, 207, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London  Other, less dramatic, treatments before Titian established his composition are by Palma Vecchio and Dosso Dossi.\n\nAlthough Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy, in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  With the Visitation in religious art, this was the leading recurring subject in history painting that required showing pregnancy in art, which Early Modern painters still approached with some caution.  In any case, the narrative required that the rest of the group had not previously noticed the pregnancy.\n\nCallisto being seduced by Zeus/Jupiter in disguise was also a popular subject, usually called \"Jupiter and Callisto\"; it was the clearest common subject with lesbian lovers from classical mythology.  The two lovers are usually shown happily embracing in a bower. The violent rape described by Ovid as following Callisto's realization of what is going on is rarely shown.  In versions before about 1700 Callisto may show some doubt about what is going on, as in the versions by Rubens. It was especially popular in the 18th century, when depictions were increasingly erotic; François Boucher painted several versions.Hall, Gods\n\nAeschylus' tragedy Callisto is lost.\n\nOrigin of the myth\n\nThe name Kalliste (Καλλίστη), \"most beautiful\", may be recognized as an epithet of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of Artemis Kalliste (Άρτεμις Καλλίστη), date before the third century BCE.Daniel J. Geagan. \"The Athenian Constitution After Sulla\" (Hesperia Supplements 12 1967:72, 95). Artemis Kalliste was worshiped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the Academy.Klio: Beiträge Zur Alten Geschichte (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften Zu Berlin Institut für Griechisch-Römische Altertumskunde) 1907. W. S. Ferguson suggestedIn Klio 7 (1907:213f). that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the Brauronia.\n\nThe myth in Catasterismi may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the Zodiac sign of Libra, namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, Boötes, and Virgo. The constellation Boötes, was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic Astronomia (Αστρονομία)Hesiod, Astronomia, fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on Aratus. as Arcas, the \"Bear-warden\" (Arktophylax; Αρκτοφύλαξ):Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Boötes, Βοώτης, from his very name, is a cow (βοως) herdsman.\n\nHe is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.The episode is a doublet of the serving up of Pelops.\n\nThe stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to Julien d'Huy, who used phylogenetic and statistical tools, the story could be a recent transformation of a Palaeolithic myth.d'Huy Julien, Un ours dans les étoiles: recherche phylogénétique Sur un mythe préhistorique.
