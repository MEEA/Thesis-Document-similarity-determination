As a child, he was a fan of puzzles and played with pentomino toys. In creating Tetris, he drew inspiration from these toys.\n\nPajitnov created Tetris with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.\n\nPajitnov also created a sequel to Tetris, entitled Welltris, which has the same principle but in a three dimensional environment where the player sees the playing area from above. Tetris was licensed and managed by Soviet company ELORG which had been founded especially for this purpose, and advertised with the slogan \"From Russia with Love\" (on NES: \"From Russia With Fun!\"). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.\n\nPajitnov, together with Vladimir Pokhilko, moved to the United States in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers. He helped design the puzzles in the Super NES versions of Yoshi's Cookie and designed the game Pandora's Box, which incorporates more traditional jigsaw-style puzzles.\n\nHe was employed by Microsoft from October 1996 until 2005. While there he worked on the Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection, MSN Mind Aerobics and MSN Games groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of Hexic, Hexic HD, was included with every new Xbox 360 Premium package.\n\nOn 18 August 2005, WildSnake Software announced that Pajitnov would be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPajitnov's son, Dmitri, died in a skiing accident on Mount Rainier in 2017.\n\nWorks\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nIn 1996, GameSpot named him as the fourth most influential computer game developer of all time.\n\nOn 7 March 2007, he received the Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award.
