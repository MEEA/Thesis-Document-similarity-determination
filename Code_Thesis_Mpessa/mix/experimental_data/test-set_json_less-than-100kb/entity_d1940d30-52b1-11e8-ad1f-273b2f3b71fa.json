  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the Bernoulli numbers  are a sequence of rational numbers which occur frequently in number theory. The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the table to the right. For even  other than 0,  is negative if  is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For all odd  other than 1, .\n\nThe superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the  term is concerned: \n* with  ( / ) is the sign convention prescribed by NIST and most modern textbooks.\n*  with  ( / ) is sometimes used in the older literature.\n\nIn the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are special values of the Bernoulli polynomials B_n(x), with B^{-{}}_nB_n(0) and B^+_n\nB_n(1).\n\nSince  for all odd , and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write \"\" to mean .  This article does not follow this notation.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers appear in the Taylor series expansions of the tangent and hyperbolic tangent functions, in formulas for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the Euler–Maclaurin formula, and in expressions for certain values of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa.  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712Selin, H. (1997), p. 891Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108  in his work Katsuyo Sampo; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his Ars Conjectandi of 1713.  Ada Lovelace's note G on the Analytical Engine from 1842 describes an algorithm for generating Bernoulli numbers with Babbage's machine.Note G in the Menabrea reference As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex computer program.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.\n\nMethods to calculate the sum of the first  positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first  positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity which considered this problem were: Pythagoras (c. 572–497 BCE, Greece), Archimedes (287–212 BCE, Italy), Aryabhata (b. 476, India), Abu Bakr al-Karaji (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1039, Iraq).\n\nDuring the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West Thomas Harriot (1560–1621) of England, Johann Faulhaber (1580–1635) of Germany, Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) all played important roles.\n\nThomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 Academia Algebrae, far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.\n\nBlaise Pascal in 1654 proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the th powers of the first  positive integers for .\n\nThe Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants  which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers .\n\nThe joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the th powers for any positive integer  can be seen from his comment. He wrote:\n\n\"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500.\"\n\nBernoulli's result was published posthumously in Ars Conjectandi in 1713.  Seki Kōwa independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.\n\nBernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of Abraham de Moivre.\n\nBernoulli's formula is sometimes called Faulhaber's formula after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth  a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by Carl Jacobi in 1834 . E. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):\n\n\"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants  … would provide a uniform\n\n:  \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}+\\binom{m+1} 1 B^+_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}+\\cdots+\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) \n:or\n:  \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}-\\binom{m+1} 1 B^{-{}}_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}-\\cdots +(-1)^m\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) \nfor all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for  from polynomials in  to polynomials in .\"  \n\nReconstruction of \"Summae Potestatum\" \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers (n)/(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book Ars Conjectandi published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted , ,  and  by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as , , , . The expression  means  – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are falling factorial powers . The factorial notation  as a shortcut for  was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675 who used it as a long letter  for \"summa\" (sum). (The Mathematics Genealogy Project[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]\nshows Leibniz as the academic advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus.[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]) The letter  on the left hand side is not an index of summation but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as . Putting things together, for positive , today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:\n\n \\sum_{k1}^n k^c \n \\frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\\frac 1 2 n^c+\\sum_{k=2}^c \\frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.\n\nThis formula suggests setting  when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the falling factorial  has for  the value . \nThus Bernoulli's formula can be written\n \\sum_{k1}^n k^c \n \\sum_{k=0}^c \\frac{B_k}{k!}c^{\\underline{k-1}} n^{c-k+1}\n\nif , recapturing the value Bernoulli gave to the coefficient at that position.\n\nDefinitions \n\nMany characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:\n\n* a recursive equation,\n* an explicit formula,\n* a generating function.\n\nFor the proof of the equivalence of the three approaches see  or .\n\nRecursive definition \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas \n \\begin{align} \\sum_{k0}^{m}\\binom {m+1} k B^{-{}}_k &\n \\delta_{m, 0} \\\\ \\sum_{k0}^{m}\\binom {m+1} k B^{+{}}_k &\n m+1 \\end{align}\nwhere m=0,1,2... and  denotes the Kronecker delta. Solving for B^{\\mp{}}_m gives the recursive formulas\n\\begin{align}\n  B_m^{-{}} &\\delta_{m, 0} - \\sum_{k\n0}^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{B^{-{}}_k}{m - k + 1} \\\\\n  B_m^+ &1 - \\sum_{k\n0}^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{B^+_k}{m - k + 1}\n\\end{align}\n\nExplicit definition \n\nIn 1893 Louis Saalschütz listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers , usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:\n\\begin{align}\n  B^{-{}}_m &\\sum_{k\n0}^m \\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \\binom{k}{v} \\frac{v^m}{k + 1} \\\\\n  B^+_m &\\sum_{k\n0}^m \\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \\binom{k}{v} \\frac{(v + 1)^m}{k + 1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nGenerating function \n\nThe exponential generating functions are\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{t}{e^t - 1}    &\\frac{t}{2} \\left( \\operatorname{coth} \\frac{t}{2} -1 \\right) &\n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{B^{-{}}_m t^m}{m!}\\\\\n  \\frac{t}{1 - e^{-t}} &\\frac{t}{2} \\left( \\operatorname{coth} \\frac{t}{2} +1 \\right) &\n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{B^+_m t^m}{m!}. \n\\end{align}\n\nThe (normal) generating function\n z^{-1} \\psi_1(z^{-1}) \\sum_{m\n0}^{\\infty} B^+_m z^m\n\nis an asymptotic series. It contains the trigamma function .\n\nBernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function:\n\nfor .\n\nHere the argument of the zeta function is 0 or negative.\n\nBy means of the zeta functional equation and the gamma reflection formula the following relation can be obtained:\n\n B_{2n} = \\frac {(-1)^{n+1}2(2n)!} {(2\\pi)^{2n}} \\zeta(2n)  for .\n\nNow the argument of the zeta function is positive.\n\nIt then follows from  () and Stirling's formula that\n |B_{2 n}| \\sim 4 \\sqrt{\\pi n} \\left(\\frac{n}{ \\pi e} \\right)^{2n}  for .\n\nEfficient computation of Bernoulli numbers \n\nIn some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers  through  modulo , where  is a prime; for example to test whether Vandiver's conjecture holds for , or even just to determine whether  is an irregular prime. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of)  arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed  which require only  operations (see big  notation).\n\nDavid Harvey  describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing  modulo  for many small primes , and then reconstructing  via the Chinese remainder theorem. Harvey writes that the asymptotic time complexity of this algorithm is  and claims that this implementation is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed  for . Harvey's implementation has been included in SageMath since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner  computed  to full precision for  in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk  for  with Mathematica in April 2008.\n\n:* Digits is to be understood as the exponent of 10 when  is written as a real number in normalized scientific notation.\n\nApplications of the Bernoulli numbers \n\nAsymptotic analysis \n\nArguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the Euler–Maclaurin formula. Assuming that  is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as Concrete Mathematics, (9.67).\n\n\\sum_{ka}^{b-1} f(k) \n \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{B^-_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_-(f,m).\n\nThis formulation assumes the convention . Using the convention  the formula becomes\n\n\\sum_{ka+1}^{b} f(k) \n \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{B^+_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_+(f,m).\n\nHere  (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a  is just ). Moreover, let  denote an antiderivative of . By the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).\n\nThus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula\n\n \\sum_{ka}^{b}f(k)\n \\sum_{k=0}^m \\frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R(f,m). \n\nThis form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function\n\n \\begin{align}\n  \\zeta(s) & \\sum_{k\n0}^m \\frac{B^+_k}{k!} s^{\\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\\\\n           & = \\frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\\overline{-1}} + \\frac{B^+_1}{1!} s^{\\overline{0}} + \\frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\\overline{1}} +\\cdots+R(s,m) \\\\\n           & = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}s + \\cdots + R(s,m).\n\\end{align} \n\nHere  denotes the rising factorial power.Concrete Mathematics, (2.44) and (2.52)\n\nBernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of asymptotic expansions. The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the digamma function .\n\n\\psi(z) \\sim \\ln z - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{B^+_k}{k z^k} \n\nSum of powers \n\nBernoulli numbers feature prominently in the closed form expression of the sum of the th powers of the first  positive integers. For  define\n\nS_m(n) \\sum_{k\n1}^n k^m = 1^m + 2^m + \\cdots + n^m. \n\nThis expression can always be rewritten as a polynomial in  of degree . The coefficients of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by Bernoulli's formula:\nS_m(n) \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\sum_{k\n0}^m \\binom{m + 1}{k} B^+_k n^{m + 1 - k},\nwhere  denotes the binomial coefficient.\n\nFor example, taking  to be 1 gives the triangular numbers  .\n\n 1 + 2 + \\cdots + n \\frac{1}{2} (B_0 n^2 + 2 B^+_1 n^1) \n \\tfrac12 (n^2 + n).\n\nTaking  to be 2 gives the square pyramidal numbers  .\n\n1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + n^2 \\frac{1}{3} (B_0 n^3 + 3 B^+_1 n^2 + 3 B_2 n^1) \n \\tfrac13 \\left(n^3 + \\tfrac32 n^2 + \\tfrac12 n\\right).\n\nSome authors use the alternate convention for Bernoulli numbers and state Bernoulli's formula in this way:\nS_m(n) \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\sum_{k\n0}^m (-1)^k \\binom{m + 1}{k} B^{-{}}_k n^{m + 1 - k}.\n\nBernoulli's formula is sometimes called Faulhaber's formula after Johann Faulhaber who also found remarkable ways to calculate sums of powers.\n\nFaulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a -analog .\n\nTaylor series\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers appear in the Taylor series expansion of many trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions.\n\n;Tangent\n \\begin{align}\n\\tan x &\\sum_{n\n1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n} (2^{2n}-1) B_{2n} }{(2n)!}\\; x^{2n-1},& \\left |x \\right | &\n \n;Cotangent\n \\begin{align}\n\\cot x & {} \\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{n\n0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&  \\qquad 0 \n\n;Hyperbolic tangent\n\\begin{align}\n\\tanh x &\\sum_{n\n1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{2n}(2^{2n}-1)B_{2n}}{(2n)!}\\;x^{2n-1},& |x| &\n\n;Hyperbolic cotangent\n \\begin{align}\n\\coth x & {} \\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{n\n0}^\\infty \\frac{B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&  \\qquad \\qquad 0 \n\nLaurent series\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers appear in the following Laurent series:\n\nDigamma function:  \\psi(z)\\ln z- \\sum_{k\n1}^\\infty \\frac {B_k^{+{}}} {k z^k} \n\nUse in topology \n\nThe Kervaire–Milnor's formula for the order of the cyclic group of diffeomorphism classes of exotic -spheres which bound parallelizable manifolds involves Bernoulli numbers.

Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function  and the power function  is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as\n\n W_{n,k}\\sum_{v\n0}^k (-1)^{v+k} (v+1)^n \\frac{k!}{v!(k-v)!} . \n\nThey can also be expressed through the Stirling numbers of the second kind\n\n W_{n,k}=k! \\left\\{ {n+1\\atop k+1} \\right\\}.\n\nA Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion–exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the harmonic sequence 1, , , …\n\n B_{n}\\sum_{k\n0}^n (-1)^k \\frac{W_{n,k}}{k+1}\\ \\ \\sum_{k\n0}^n \\frac{1}{k+1} \\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v (v+1)^n {k \\choose v}\\ . \n\n:\n:\n:\nThis representation has .\n\nConsider the sequence , .

Woon  described an algorithm to compute  as a binary tree:\n\nWoon's recursive algorithm (for ) starts by assigning to the root node . Given a node  of the tree, the left child of the node is  and the right child . A node  is written as  in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of .\n\nGiven a node  the factorial of  is defined as\n\n N! a_1 \\prod_{k\n2}^{\\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. \n\nRestricted to the nodes  of a fixed tree-level  the sum of  is , thus\n\n B_n = \\sum_\\stackrel{N \\text{ node of}}{\\text{ tree-level } n} \\frac{n!}{N!}. \n\nFor example:\n:\nIntegral representation and continuation\n\nThe integral\n b(s) = 2e^{\\frac{1}{2}s i \\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{st^{s}}{1-e^{2\\pi t}} \\frac{dt}{t} \nhas as special values  for .\n\nFor example,  and . Here  denotes the Riemann zeta function and Ι the imaginary unit. Already Leonhard Euler (Opera Omnia, Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p. 351) considered these numbers and calculated\n\n \\begin{align}\n  p & \\frac{3}{2\\pi^3}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{3^3}+\\cdots \\right) \n 0.0581522\\ldots \\\\\n  q &\\frac{15}{2\\pi^5}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^5}+\\frac{1}{3^5}+\\cdots \\right) \n 0.0254132\\ldots.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe relation to the Euler numbers and \n\nThe Euler numbers are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the\nasymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers  are in magnitude approximately  times larger than the Bernoulli numbers . In consequence:\n\n \\pi \\sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \\frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. \n\nThis asymptotic equation reveals that  lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact  could be computed from these rational approximations.\n\nBernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd ,  (with the exception ), it suffices to consider the case when  is even.\n\n\\begin{align}\n B_{n} &\\sum_{k\n0}^{n-1}\\binom{n-1}{k} \\frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k & n&=2, 4, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n E_{n} &\\sum_{k\n1}^n \\binom{n}{k-1} \\frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k & n&=2,4,6,\\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThese conversion formulas express an inverse relation between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to . These numbers are defined for  as\n\n S_n 2 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^n \\sum_{k\n-\\infty}^\\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \\qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\\ldots \n\nand  by convention . The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by Leonhard Euler in a landmark paper  ‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’ (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are\n\n S_n = 1,1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{5}{24}, \\frac{2}{15},\\frac{61}{720},\\frac{17}{315},\\frac{277}{8064},\\frac{62}{2835},\\ldots   ( / )\n\nThese are the coefficients in the expansion of .\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as special views of these numbers, selected from the sequence  and scaled for use in special applications.\n\n\\begin{align}\n  B_{n} &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] \\frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\\, S_{n}\\ , & n&\n 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n  E_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] n! \\, S_{n+1}  & n &\n 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThe expression [ even] has the value 1 if  is even and 0 otherwise (Iverson bracket).\n\nThese identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of  when  is even. The  are rational approximations to  and two successive terms always enclose the true value of . Beginning with  the sequence starts ( / ):\n\n 2, 4, 3, \\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{25}{8}, \\frac{192}{61}, \\frac{427}{136}, \\frac{4352}{1385}, \\frac{12465}{3968}, \\frac{158720}{50521},\\ldots \\quad \\longrightarrow \\pi. \n\nThese rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.\n\nConsider the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform for the sequence  () /  ():\n\nFrom the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is − × .\n\nAn algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle\n\nThe sequence Sn has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of Sn divide the factorial (n − 1)!. In other words: the numbers Tn = Sn(n − 1)!, sometimes called Euler zigzag numbers, are integers.\n\n T_n 1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,2,\\,5,\\,16,\\,61,\\,272,\\,1385,\\,7936,\\,50521,\\,353792,\\ldots \\quad n\n0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots  (). See ().\n\nThus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as\n\n\\begin{align}\n B_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] \\frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\\, T_n\\ , & n &\n 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n E_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] T_{n+1} & n &\n 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThese identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers  are given immediately by  and the Bernoulli numbers  are obtained from  by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.\n\nWhat remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers . However, already in 1877 Philipp Ludwig von Seidel  published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate .\n\n#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let  denote the number of the row currently being filled\n#If  is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row  in the first position of the row , and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper\n#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.\n#If  is even, proceed similar in the other direction.\n\nSeidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont ) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.\n\nSimilar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz  gave a recurrence equation for the numbers  and recommended this method for computing  and  ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.\n\nV. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in  and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name boustrophedon transform.\n\nTriangular form:\n\nOnly , with one 1, and , with two 1s, are in the OEIS.\n\nDistribution with a supplementary 1 and one 0 in the following rows:\n\nThis is , a signed version of .

See the array beginning with 1, 1, 0, −2, 0, 16, 0 below.\n\nThe Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to  () / () yields:\n\n1. The first column is . Its binomial transform leads to:\n\nThe first row of this array is . The absolute values of the increasing antidiagonals are . The sum of the antidiagonals is \n\n2. The second column is . Its binomial transform yields:\n\nThe first row of this array is . The absolute values of the second bisection are the double of the absolute values of the first bisection.\n\nConsider the Akiyama-Tanigawa algorithm applied to  () / ( ()  abs( ()) + 1 \n .\n\nThe first column whose the absolute values are  could be the numerator of a trigonometric function.\n\n is an autosequence of the first kind (the main diagonal is ). The corresponding array is:\n\nThe first two upper diagonals are   × . The sum of the antidiagonals is  \n 2 × (n + 1).\n\n− is an autosequence of the second kind, like for instance  / . Hence the array:\n\nThe main diagonal, here , is the double of the first upper one, here . The sum of the antidiagonals is  2 × (1). Note that  −  \n 2 × .\n\nA combinatorial view: alternating permutations\n\nAround 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, Désiré André proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis  & . Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the trigonometric functions\n and  André made a startling discovery.\n\n\\begin{align}\n \\tan x &= x + \\frac{2x^3}{3!} + \\frac{16x^5}{5!} + \\frac{272x^7}{7!} + \\frac{7936x^9}{9!} + \\cdots\\\\[6pt]\n \\sec x &= 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{5x^4}{4!} + \\frac{61x^6}{6!} + \\frac{1385x^8}{8!} + \\frac{50521x^{10}}{10!} + \\cdots\n\\end{align}\n\nThe coefficients are the Euler numbers of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of  has as coefficients the rational numbers .\n\n \\tan x + \\sec x = 1 + x + \\tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3}x^3 + \\tfrac{5}{24}x^4 + \\tfrac{2}{15}x^5 + \\tfrac{61}{720}x^6 + \\cdots \n\nAndré then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the alternating permutations of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).\n\nRelated sequences\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: \n, , , , ,  / . Via the second row of its inverse Akiyama–Tanigawa transform , they lead to Balmer series  / .\n\nThe Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to  () /  () leads to the Bernoulli numbers  / ,  / , or   without , named intrinsic Bernoulli numbers .\n\nHence another link between the intrinsic Bernoulli numbers and the Balmer series via  ().\n\n () = 0, 2, 1, 6,… is a permutation of the non-negative numbers.\n\nThe terms of the first row are .\n\nEuler  () /  () without the second term () are the fractional intrinsic Euler numbers  The corresponding Akiyama transform is:\n\nThe first line is .  preceded by a zero is an autosequence of the first kind. It is linked to the Oresme numbers. The numerators of the second line are  preceded by 0. The difference table is:\n\nGeneralization to the odd-index Bernoulli numbers\n\n1, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,… (/)[http://oeis.org/wiki/User:Peter_Luschny/TheLostBernoulliNumbers Odd-index Bernoulli numbers]\n\nThis is  where  is the th coefficient of  (/).\n\nA companion to the Bernoulli numbers\n\nSee .

The second row is /. For the third row, see .\n\nThe first column is  from Mersenne primes, see . For the second column see .\n\nConsider the triangle  ()  \n\nThis is Pascal's triangle  bordered by zeroes. The antidiagonals' sums are , the Fibonacci numbers. Two elementary transforms yield the array ASPEC0, a companion to ASPEC in .\n\nMultiplying the SBD array in  by ASPEC0, we have by row sums /:\n\nThis triangle is unreduced.\n\nArithmetical properties of the Bernoulli numbers\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as  for integers  provided for  and  the expression  is understood as the limiting value and the convention  is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the Agoh–Giuga conjecture postulates that  is a prime number if and only if  is congruent to −1 modulo . Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the ideal class groups of cyclotomic fields by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the Herbrand-Ribet theorem, and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by Ankeny–Artin–Chowla.\n\nThe Kummer theorems \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are related to Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) by Kummer's theorem , which says:\n\nIf the odd prime  does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers  then  has no solutions in nonzero integers.\n\nPrime numbers with this property are called regular primes. Another classical result of Kummer  are the following congruences.\n\nLet  be an odd prime and  an even number such that  does not divide . Then for any non-negative integer \n:  \\frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b} \\equiv \\frac{B_{b}}{b} \\pmod{p}. \n\nA generalization of these congruences goes by the name of -adic continuity.\n\n-adic continuity\n\nIf ,  and  are positive integers such that  and  are not divisible by  and , then\n\n(1-p^{m-1})\\frac{B_m}{m} \\equiv (1-p^{n-1})\\frac{B_n} n \\pmod{p^b}.\n\nSince , this can also be written\n\n\\left(1-p^{-u}\\right)\\zeta(u) \\equiv \\left(1-p^{-v}\\right)\\zeta(v) \\pmod{p^b},\n\nwhere  and , so that  and  are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo . This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with  taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the -adic numbers on odd negative integers congruent modulo  to a particular , and so can be extended to a continuous function  for all -adic integers , the -adic zeta function.\n\nRamanujan's congruences \n\nThe following relations, due to Ramanujan, provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:\n\n\\binom{m+3}{m} B_m=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{m+3}{3}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 0\\pmod 6;\\\\\n\\frac{m+3}{3}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m-2}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 2\\pmod 6;\\\\\n-\\frac{m+3}{6}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m-4}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 4\\pmod 6.\\end{cases}\n\nVon Staudt–Clausen theorem \n\nThe von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by Karl Georg Christian von Staudt  and Thomas Clausen  independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every ,\n B_{2n} + \\sum_{(p-1)\\,\\mid\\,2n} \\frac1p\nis an integer. The sum extends over all primes  for which  divides .\n\nA consequence of this is that the denominator of  is given by the product of all primes  for which  divides . In particular, these denominators are square-free and divisible by 6.\n\nWhy do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? \n\nThe sum\n\n\\varphi_k(n) \\sum_{i\n0}^n i^k - \\frac{n^k} 2\n\ncan be evaluated for negative values of the index . Doing so will show that it is an odd function for even values of , which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that  is 0 for  even and ; and that the term for  is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for n > 1).\n\nFrom the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd  the number  is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets\n\n 2B_n \\sum_{m\n0}^n (-1)^m \\frac{2}{m+1}m! \\left\\ x^{k}}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\left(\\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\\right)}\n2\\sum_{k\n1}^\\infty \\frac{k^{\\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\beta_{2k}}. \n\n denotes the rising factorial power in the notation of D. E. Knuth. The numbers  occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because  is a -integer for primes  where  does not divide .  The  are called divided Bernoulli numbers.\n\nGeneralized Bernoulli numbers\n\nThe generalized Bernoulli numbers are certain algebraic numbers, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to special values of Dirichlet -functions in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nLet  be a Dirichlet character modulo . The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to  are defined by\n\n\\sum_{a1}^f \\chi(a) \\frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1} \n \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty B_{k,\\chi}\\frac{t^k}{k!}.\n\nApart from the exceptional , we have, for any Dirichlet character , that  if .\n\nGeneralizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers :\n\nL(1-k,\\chi)=-\\frac{B_{k,\\chi}}k,\n\nwhere  is the Dirichlet -function of .\n\nAppendix\n\nAssorted identities \n\n{n-k}\\frac{B_k}{k} - \\sum_{k2}^{n-2} \\binom{n}{k}\\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k} B_k \nH_n B_n\n\n|11 = Let .

For all odd  other than 1, .\n\nThe superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the  term is concerned: \n* with  ( / ) is the sign convention prescribed by NIST and most modern textbooks.\n*  with  ( / ) is sometimes used in the older literature.\n\nIn the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are special values of the Bernoulli polynomials B_n(x), with B^{-{}}_nB_n(0) and B^+_n\nB_n(1).\n\nSince  for all odd , and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write \"\" to mean .  This article does not follow this notation.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers appear in the Taylor series expansions of the tangent and hyperbolic tangent functions, in formulas for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the Euler–Maclaurin formula, and in expressions for certain values of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa.  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712Selin, H. (1997), p. 891Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108  in his work Katsuyo Sampo; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his Ars Conjectandi of 1713.  Ada Lovelace's note G on the Analytical Engine from 1842 describes an algorithm for generating Bernoulli numbers with Babbage's machine.Note G in the Menabrea reference As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex computer program.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.\n\nMethods to calculate the sum of the first  positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first  positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity which considered this problem were: Pythagoras (c. 572–497 BCE, Greece), Archimedes (287–212 BCE, Italy), Aryabhata (b. 476, India), Abu Bakr al-Karaji (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1039, Iraq).\n\nDuring the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West Thomas Harriot (1560–1621) of England, Johann Faulhaber (1580–1635) of Germany, Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) all played important roles.\n\nThomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 Academia Algebrae, far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.\n\nBlaise Pascal in 1654 proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the th powers of the first  positive integers for .\n\nThe Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants  which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers .\n\nThe joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the th powers for any positive integer  can be seen from his comment. He wrote:\n\n\"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500.\"\n\nBernoulli's result was published posthumously in Ars Conjectandi in 1713.  Seki Kōwa independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.\n\nBernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of Abraham de Moivre.\n\nBernoulli's formula is sometimes called Faulhaber's formula after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth  a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by Carl Jacobi in 1834 . E. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):\n\n\"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants  … would provide a uniform\n\n:  \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}+\\binom{m+1} 1 B^+_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}+\\cdots+\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) \n:or\n:  \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}-\\binom{m+1} 1 B^{-{}}_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}-\\cdots +(-1)^m\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) \nfor all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for  from polynomials in  to polynomials in .\"  \n\nReconstruction of \"Summae Potestatum\" \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers (n)/(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book Ars Conjectandi published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted , ,  and  by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as , , , . The expression  means  – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are falling factorial powers . The factorial notation  as a shortcut for  was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675 who used it as a long letter  for \"summa\" (sum). (The Mathematics Genealogy Project[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]\nshows Leibniz as the academic advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus.[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]) The letter  on the left hand side is not an index of summation but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as . Putting things together, for positive , today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:\n\n \\sum_{k1}^n k^c \n \\frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\\frac 1 2 n^c+\\sum_{k=2}^c \\frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.\n\nThis formula suggests setting  when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the falling factorial  has for  the value . \nThus Bernoulli's formula can be written\n \\sum_{k1}^n k^c \n \\sum_{k=0}^c \\frac{B_k}{k!}c^{\\underline{k-1}} n^{c-k+1}\n\nif , recapturing the value Bernoulli gave to the coefficient at that position.\n\nDefinitions \n\nMany characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:\n\n* a recursive equation,\n* an explicit formula,\n* a generating function.\n\nFor the proof of the equivalence of the three approaches see  or .\n\nRecursive definition \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas \n \\begin{align} \\sum_{k0}^{m}\\binom {m+1} k B^{-{}}_k &\n \\delta_{m, 0} \\\\ \\sum_{k0}^{m}\\binom {m+1} k B^{+{}}_k &\n m+1 \\end{align}\nwhere m=0,1,2... and  denotes the Kronecker delta. Solving for B^{\\mp{}}_m gives the recursive formulas\n\\begin{align}\n  B_m^{-{}} &\\delta_{m, 0} - \\sum_{k\n0}^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{B^{-{}}_k}{m - k + 1} \\\\\n  B_m^+ &1 - \\sum_{k\n0}^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{B^+_k}{m - k + 1}\n\\end{align}\n\nExplicit definition \n\nIn 1893 Louis Saalschütz listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers , usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:\n\\begin{align}\n  B^{-{}}_m &\\sum_{k\n0}^m \\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \\binom{k}{v} \\frac{v^m}{k + 1} \\\\\n  B^+_m &\\sum_{k\n0}^m \\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \\binom{k}{v} \\frac{(v + 1)^m}{k + 1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nGenerating function \n\nThe exponential generating functions are\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{t}{e^t - 1}    &\\frac{t}{2} \\left( \\operatorname{coth} \\frac{t}{2} -1 \\right) &\n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{B^{-{}}_m t^m}{m!}\\\\\n  \\frac{t}{1 - e^{-t}} &\\frac{t}{2} \\left( \\operatorname{coth} \\frac{t}{2} +1 \\right) &\n \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{B^+_m t^m}{m!}. \n\\end{align}\n\nThe (normal) generating function\n z^{-1} \\psi_1(z^{-1}) \\sum_{m\n0}^{\\infty} B^+_m z^m\n\nis an asymptotic series.

It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of)  arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed  which require only  operations (see big  notation).\n\nDavid Harvey  describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing  modulo  for many small primes , and then reconstructing  via the Chinese remainder theorem. Harvey writes that the asymptotic time complexity of this algorithm is  and claims that this implementation is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed  for . Harvey's implementation has been included in SageMath since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner  computed  to full precision for  in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk  for  with Mathematica in April 2008.\n\n:* Digits is to be understood as the exponent of 10 when  is written as a real number in normalized scientific notation.\n\nApplications of the Bernoulli numbers \n\nAsymptotic analysis \n\nArguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the Euler–Maclaurin formula. Assuming that  is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as Concrete Mathematics, (9.67).\n\n\\sum_{ka}^{b-1} f(k) \n \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{B^-_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_-(f,m).\n\nThis formulation assumes the convention . Using the convention  the formula becomes\n\n\\sum_{ka+1}^{b} f(k) \n \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{B^+_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_+(f,m).\n\nHere  (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a  is just ). Moreover, let  denote an antiderivative of . By the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).\n\nThus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula\n\n \\sum_{ka}^{b}f(k)\n \\sum_{k=0}^m \\frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R(f,m). \n\nThis form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function\n\n \\begin{align}\n  \\zeta(s) & \\sum_{k\n0}^m \\frac{B^+_k}{k!} s^{\\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\\\\n           & = \\frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\\overline{-1}} + \\frac{B^+_1}{1!} s^{\\overline{0}} + \\frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\\overline{1}} +\\cdots+R(s,m) \\\\\n           & = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}s + \\cdots + R(s,m).\n\\end{align} \n\nHere  denotes the rising factorial power.Concrete Mathematics, (2.44) and (2.52)\n\nBernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of asymptotic expansions.

If  is set to − they are valid only for  and  respectively.\n\nA binary tree representation\n\nThe Stirling polynomials  are related to the Bernoulli numbers by . S. C. Woon  described an algorithm to compute  as a binary tree:\n\nWoon's recursive algorithm (for ) starts by assigning to the root node . Given a node  of the tree, the left child of the node is  and the right child . A node  is written as  in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of .\n\nGiven a node  the factorial of  is defined as\n\n N! a_1 \\prod_{k\n2}^{\\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. \n\nRestricted to the nodes  of a fixed tree-level  the sum of  is , thus\n\n B_n = \\sum_\\stackrel{N \\text{ node of}}{\\text{ tree-level } n} \\frac{n!}{N!}. \n\nFor example:\n:\nIntegral representation and continuation\n\nThe integral\n b(s) = 2e^{\\frac{1}{2}s i \\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{st^{s}}{1-e^{2\\pi t}} \\frac{dt}{t} \nhas as special values  for .\n\nFor example,  and . Here  denotes the Riemann zeta function and Ι the imaginary unit. Already Leonhard Euler (Opera Omnia, Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p. 351) considered these numbers and calculated\n\n \\begin{align}\n  p & \\frac{3}{2\\pi^3}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{3^3}+\\cdots \\right) \n 0.0581522\\ldots \\\\\n  q &\\frac{15}{2\\pi^5}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^5}+\\frac{1}{3^5}+\\cdots \\right) \n 0.0254132\\ldots.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe relation to the Euler numbers and \n\nThe Euler numbers are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the\nasymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers  are in magnitude approximately  times larger than the Bernoulli numbers . In consequence:\n\n \\pi \\sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \\frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. \n\nThis asymptotic equation reveals that  lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact  could be computed from these rational approximations.\n\nBernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd ,  (with the exception ), it suffices to consider the case when  is even.\n\n\\begin{align}\n B_{n} &\\sum_{k\n0}^{n-1}\\binom{n-1}{k} \\frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k & n&=2, 4, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n E_{n} &\\sum_{k\n1}^n \\binom{n}{k-1} \\frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k & n&=2,4,6,\\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThese conversion formulas express an inverse relation between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to . These numbers are defined for  as\n\n S_n 2 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^n \\sum_{k\n-\\infty}^\\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \\qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\\ldots \n\nand  by convention . The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by Leonhard Euler in a landmark paper  ‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’ (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are\n\n S_n = 1,1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{5}{24}, \\frac{2}{15},\\frac{61}{720},\\frac{17}{315},\\frac{277}{8064},\\frac{62}{2835},\\ldots   ( / )\n\nThese are the coefficients in the expansion of .\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as special views of these numbers, selected from the sequence  and scaled for use in special applications.\n\n\\begin{align}\n  B_{n} &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] \\frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\\, S_{n}\\ , & n&\n 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n  E_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] n! \\, S_{n+1}  & n &\n 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThe expression [ even] has the value 1 if  is even and 0 otherwise (Iverson bracket).\n\nThese identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of  when  is even. The  are rational approximations to  and two successive terms always enclose the true value of .

The first column is − × .\n\nAn algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle\n\nThe sequence Sn has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of Sn divide the factorial (n − 1)!. In other words: the numbers Tn = Sn(n − 1)!, sometimes called Euler zigzag numbers, are integers.\n\n T_n 1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,2,\\,5,\\,16,\\,61,\\,272,\\,1385,\\,7936,\\,50521,\\,353792,\\ldots \\quad n\n0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots  (). See ().\n\nThus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as\n\n\\begin{align}\n B_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] \\frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\\, T_n\\ , & n &\n 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n E_n &(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] T_{n+1} & n &\n 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}\n\nThese identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers  are given immediately by  and the Bernoulli numbers  are obtained from  by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.\n\nWhat remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers . However, already in 1877 Philipp Ludwig von Seidel  published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate .\n\n#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let  denote the number of the row currently being filled\n#If  is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row  in the first position of the row , and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper\n#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.\n#If  is even, proceed similar in the other direction.\n\nSeidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont ) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.\n\nSimilar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz  gave a recurrence equation for the numbers  and recommended this method for computing  and  ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.\n\nV. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in  and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name boustrophedon transform.\n\nTriangular form:\n\nOnly , with one 1, and , with two 1s, are in the OEIS.\n\nDistribution with a supplementary 1 and one 0 in the following rows:\n\nThis is , a signed version of .

Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the trigonometric functions\n and  André made a startling discovery.\n\n\\begin{align}\n \\tan x &= x + \\frac{2x^3}{3!} + \\frac{16x^5}{5!} + \\frac{272x^7}{7!} + \\frac{7936x^9}{9!} + \\cdots\\\\[6pt]\n \\sec x &= 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{5x^4}{4!} + \\frac{61x^6}{6!} + \\frac{1385x^8}{8!} + \\frac{50521x^{10}}{10!} + \\cdots\n\\end{align}\n\nThe coefficients are the Euler numbers of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of  has as coefficients the rational numbers .\n\n \\tan x + \\sec x = 1 + x + \\tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3}x^3 + \\tfrac{5}{24}x^4 + \\tfrac{2}{15}x^5 + \\tfrac{61}{720}x^6 + \\cdots \n\nAndré then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the alternating permutations of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).\n\nRelated sequences\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: \n, , , , ,  / .

This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the Agoh–Giuga conjecture postulates that  is a prime number if and only if  is congruent to −1 modulo . Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the ideal class groups of cyclotomic fields by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the Herbrand-Ribet theorem, and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by Ankeny–Artin–Chowla.\n\nThe Kummer theorems \n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are related to Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) by Kummer's theorem , which says:\n\nIf the odd prime  does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers  then  has no solutions in nonzero integers.\n\nPrime numbers with this property are called regular primes. Another classical result of Kummer  are the following congruences.\n\nLet  be an odd prime and  an even number such that  does not divide . Then for any non-negative integer \n:  \\frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b} \\equiv \\frac{B_{b}}{b} \\pmod{p}. \n\nA generalization of these congruences goes by the name of -adic continuity.\n\n-adic continuity\n\nIf ,  and  are positive integers such that  and  are not divisible by  and , then\n\n(1-p^{m-1})\\frac{B_m}{m} \\equiv (1-p^{n-1})\\frac{B_n} n \\pmod{p^b}.\n\nSince , this can also be written\n\n\\left(1-p^{-u}\\right)\\zeta(u) \\equiv \\left(1-p^{-v}\\right)\\zeta(v) \\pmod{p^b},\n\nwhere  and , so that  and  are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo . This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with  taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the -adic numbers on odd negative integers congruent modulo  to a particular , and so can be extended to a continuous function  for all -adic integers , the -adic zeta function.\n\nRamanujan's congruences \n\nThe following relations, due to Ramanujan, provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:\n\n\\binom{m+3}{m} B_m=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{m+3}{3}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 0\\pmod 6;\\\\\n\\frac{m+3}{3}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m-2}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 2\\pmod 6;\\\\\n-\\frac{m+3}{6}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\frac{m-4}{6}\\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, & \\text{if } m\\equiv 4\\pmod 6.\\end{cases}\n\nVon Staudt–Clausen theorem \n\nThe von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by Karl Georg Christian von Staudt  and Thomas Clausen  independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every ,\n B_{2n} + \\sum_{(p-1)\\,\\mid\\,2n} \\frac1p\nis an integer. The sum extends over all primes  for which  divides .\n\nA consequence of this is that the denominator of  is given by the product of all primes  for which  divides . In particular, these denominators are square-free and divisible by 6.\n\nWhy do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? \n\nThe sum\n\n\\varphi_k(n) \\sum_{i\n0}^n i^k - \\frac{n^k} 2\n\ncan be evaluated for negative values of the index . Doing so will show that it is an odd function for even values of , which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that  is 0 for  even and ; and that the term for  is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for n > 1).\n\nFrom the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd  the number  is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets\n\n 2B_n \\sum_{m\n0}^n (-1)^m \\frac{2}{m+1}m! \\left\\ x^{k}}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\left(\\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\\right)}\n2\\sum_{k\n1}^\\infty \\frac{k^{\\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\beta_{2k}}. \n\n denotes the rising factorial power in the notation of D. E. Knuth. The numbers  occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because  is a -integer for primes  where  does not divide .  The  are called divided Bernoulli numbers.\n\nGeneralized Bernoulli numbers\n\nThe generalized Bernoulli numbers are certain algebraic numbers, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to special values of Dirichlet -functions in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nLet  be a Dirichlet character modulo . The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to  are defined by\n\n\\sum_{a1}^f \\chi(a) \\frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1} \n \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty B_{k,\\chi}\\frac{t^k}{k!}.\n\nApart from the exceptional , we have, for any Dirichlet character , that  if .\n\nGeneralizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers :\n\nL(1-k,\\chi)=-\\frac{B_{k,\\chi}}k,\n\nwhere  is the Dirichlet -function of .\n\nAppendix\n\nAssorted identities \n\n{n-k}\\frac{B_k}{k} - \\sum_{k2}^{n-2} \\binom{n}{k}\\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k} B_k \nH_n B_n\n\n|11 = Let .
