  "textBody" : "Foreign relations of Kazakhstan are primarily based on economic and political security. The Nazarbayev administration has tried to balance relations with Russia and the United States by sending petroleum and natural gas to its northern neighbor at artificially low prices while assisting the U.S. in the War on Terror. Kazakhstan is a member of the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (which it chaired in 2010), North Atlantic Cooperation Council, Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

No seabed boundary with Turkmenistan in the Caspian Sea has been agreed on and the usage of Caspian Sea water is a matter that remains unsettled by international agreement.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html#Issues Kazakhstan – Transnational Issues] CIA World Factbook\n\nAccording to Sagintaev Bakytzshan Abdirovich, first deputy prime minister, in 2015 Kazakhstan and China will sign an intergovernmental agreement on water allocation of the 24 transboundary rivers.\n\nNuclear weapons non-proliferation\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991, Kazakhstan inherited 1,410 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear-weapon test site. By April 1995, Kazakhstan had returned the warheads to Russia and, by July 2000, had destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk.\n\nOn December 2, 2009, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and the Republic of Kazakhstan designated August 29 as International Day against Nuclear Tests, the anniversary of the date that Kazakhstan closed the Semipalatinsk test site in 1991.\n\nThe contribution of Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev to nuclear non-proliferation was highly recognized by Japan. During his visit to Japan in November 2016, Nursultan Nazarbayev was awarded the title of special honorary citizen of Hiroshima for his non-proliferation efforts.\n\nIllicit drugs\n\nIllegal cannabis and, to a lesser extent, opium production in Kazakhstan is an international issue since much of the crop ends up being sold in other countries, particularly in other member-states of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In 1998, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that a \"minimum of 1,517 tons of cannabis was harvested\" in Kazakhstan.[http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/research/narcotics_crime/FactSheet/2004/Kazakhstan.pdf Kazakhstan Narcotics Factsheet 2004] The Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Program\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan became a major transit country for narcotics produced in Southwest Asia, primarily from Afghanistan. In 2001, Kazakh authorities reported 1,320 cases of drug trafficking and seized 18 metric tons of narcotics. However, this is viewed as a fraction of the actual total volume trafficked and widespread corruption continues to hamper government anti-drug efforts; Transparency International gave Kazakhstan a score of 2.2, on a scale of 0–10 with 0 indicating a \"highly corrupt\" state.[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/2274/14262/file/TI%20Annual%20Report%202004.pdf 2004 Annual Report] Transparency International Russia and other parts of Europe are the main markets for these drugs although drug use is growing in Kazakhstan as well.\n\nKazAID\n\nIn November 2014 Kazakh Foreign Minister and Resident Representative of UNDP in Kazakhstan signed a project document supporting Kazakhstan's Foreign Affairs Ministry in forming KazAID, a system of Official Development Assistance (ODA).

The project marks Kazakhstan’s first international cooperation for Afghanistan in the framework of national system of ODA.\n\nCentral Asia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nDiplomatic relations were established on August 27, 1992. Azerbaijan has an embassy in Astana. Kazakhstan has had an embassy in Baku since December 16, 1994.\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\nBilateral relationships between the countries are very strong and Kyrgyz and Kazakh are very close in terms of language, culture and religion. Kyrgyz-Kazakh relationships have always been at a very high level and economic and other formal unification of two countries have been greeted with strong appreciation by both nations since the two share a lot in common.  On April 26, 2007 the presidents of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement to create an \"International Supreme Council\" between the two states. This historic event took place during an official visit of the Kazakh president to the Kyrgyzstan capital, Bishkek.s\".

Also, in 2015 Kazakhstan allocated 300,000 euros to Syrian refugees for the supply of medicine, food and construction materials.\nKazakhstan sent its next humanitarian aid to Syria in January 2017.

The Foreign Minister underlined that economic and trade collaboration with Kazakhstan will allow investors to reach neighboring markets, such as Russia and China. Idrissov also said that Kazakhstan seeks to expand its presence in Latin America and considers Mexico as a strategic ally in building these relations, while Kazakhstan can offer the same support to Mexico in the Eurasian region.\n\nAfrica\n\nKazakhstan has proactively worked to establish ties with African nations.

After that Astana expressed its intention to provide $300,000 to the African Union's special project to fight Ebola.\n\nThe 1st day of the VIII Astana Economic Forum held on May 21, 2015 was dedicated to Africa and was titled \"Africa – the Next Driver of the Global Economy\".

It should be noted that currently Kazakhstan and the United States issue 5-year visas to citizens of each other.\n\nThis will fulfill a goal of diversifying the economy while also helping the world become more acquainted with Kazakhstan's cultural patrimony.  Since 2001 to 2012, Kazakhstan has doubled its tourism earnings.
