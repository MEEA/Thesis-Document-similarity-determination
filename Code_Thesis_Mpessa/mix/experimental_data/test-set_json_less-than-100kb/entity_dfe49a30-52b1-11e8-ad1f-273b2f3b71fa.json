  "textBody" : "A clerihew is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by Edmund Clerihew Bentley. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them.

One of his best known is this (1905):\n\nForm\n\nA clerihew has the following properties:\n* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people\n* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect\n* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]\n* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.
