  "textBody" : "International human rights instruments are treaties and other international documents relevant to international human rights law and the protection of human rights in general.[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CoreInstruments.aspx OHCHR The Core International Human Rights Instruments and their monitoring bodies] They can be classified into two categories: declarations, adopted by bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, which are not legally binding although they may be politically so as soft law; and conventions, which are legally binding instruments concluded under international law. International treaties and even declarations can, over time, obtain the status of customary international law.\n\nInternational human rights instruments can be divided further into global instruments, to which any state in the world can be a party, and regional instruments, which are restricted to states in a particular region of the world.\n\nMost conventions establish mechanisms to oversee their implementation. In some cases these mechanisms have relatively little power, and are often ignored by member states; in other cases these mechanisms have great political and legal authority, and their decisions are almost always implemented. Examples of the first case include the UN treaty committees, while the best exemplar of the second case is the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nMechanisms also vary as to the degree of individual access to them. Under some conventions – e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights – individuals or states are permitted, subject to certain conditions, to take individual cases to the enforcement mechanisms; under most, however (e.g. the UN conventions), individual access is contingent on the acceptance of that right by the relevant state party, either by a declaration at the time of ratification or accession, or through ratification of or accession to an optional protocol to the convention. This is part of the evolution of international law over the last several decades. It has moved from a body of laws governing states to recognizing the importance of individuals and their rights within the international legal framework.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are sometimes referred to as the international bill of rights.\n\nDeclarations \n\nGlobal \n\n*Declaration of the Rights of the Child 1923\n*Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948)\n*Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (UN, 1975)\n*Declaration on the Right to Development (UN, 1986)\n*Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993)\n*Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities (UNESCO, 1998)\n*Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (UNESCO, 2001)\n*Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN, 2007)\n*UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity (UN, 2008)\n\nRegional: Americas \n\n* American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (OAS, 1948)\n\nRegional: Asia \n\n* ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (ASEAN, 2009)\n\nRegional: Middle East \n\n* Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam (OIC,1990)\n\nConventions\n\nGlobal \n\nAccording to OHCHR, there are 9 core international human rights instruments and several optional protocols.
