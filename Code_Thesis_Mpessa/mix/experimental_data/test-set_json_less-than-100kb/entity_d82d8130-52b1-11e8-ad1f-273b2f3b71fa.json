  "textBody" : "The Military Forces of Colombia () are the unified armed forces of the Republic of Colombia.  The Colombian military is the second largest in the Western Hemisphere in terms of active personnel, behind the United States Armed Forces. The President of Colombia is the military's commander in chief, and helps formulate defence policy through the Ministry of National Defence (MinDefensa), which is in charge of day-to-day operations.  The Colombian military consists of the National Army of Colombia, Colombian Navy, Colombian Air Force and the Colombian Naval Infantry. Although the National Police of Colombia is technically not part of the military, it is controlled and administered by the Ministry of Defense, and has a highly militarized structure not found in most of the world's law enforcement agencies, such as a distinction between enlisted and officer ranks, and the regular use of heavy military equipment. Colombian citizens presenting themselves for conscription may also join the National Police instead of the other armed forces. This makes the National Police a de facto branch of the military.\n\nThe Colombian military has its roots in the independence war against the Spanish Empire. After their triumph against the Spanish, the Congress of Angostura created the Greater Colombian Army, to replace the disbanded Commoners Army. The Colombian military was operationally involved in World War II and was the only Latin American country to send troops to the Korean War. The Colombian Army has been the main military branch involved in the Colombian conflict. The military of Colombia has the third largest expenditure in the Americas, after the United States and Brazil respectively.

This has led to some of the most important police units adopting military training and conducting special operations alongside the Colombian Army, Air Force and Navy.
