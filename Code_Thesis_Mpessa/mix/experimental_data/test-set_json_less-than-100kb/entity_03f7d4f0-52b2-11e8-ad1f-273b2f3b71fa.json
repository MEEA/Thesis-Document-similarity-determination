  "textBody" : "A general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) is an air-cooled fully automatic weapon that can be adapted to either the light or medium machine gun roles. It may have a quick change barrel, and is suited for a variety of roles, from bipod- or tripod-mounted infantry support, to deployment as a helicopter door gun, or a vehicle-mounted support weapon. Modern GPMGs fire full-powered rifle cartridges such as the 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.5×54mm French, 7.5×55mm Swiss, and 7.92×57mm Mauser.\n\nHistory\n\n\"With the MG 34, the German Wehrmacht introduced an entirely new concept in automatic firepower – the Einheitsmaschinengewehr general-purpose machine gun (GPMG).Jane's Guns Recognition Guide.

Sterling Publishing Company. 2002. page 245 & 246 In itself the MG 34 was an excellent weapon: an air-cooled, recoil-operated machine gun that could run through belts of 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition at a rate of 850 rounds per minute, delivering killing firepower at ranges of more than 1,000 meters. Yet simply by changing its mount, sights and feed mechanism, the operator could radically transform its function. On its standard bipod it was a light machine gun, ideal for infantry assaults; on a tripod it could serve as a sustained-fire medium machine gun; aircraft or vehicular mounts turned it into an air defence weapon; and it also served as the coaxial machine gun on numerous tanks.\n\nDuring World War II, the MG 34 was superseded (although it remained in combat use) by a new GPMG, the MG 42.Jane's Guns Recognition Guide.
