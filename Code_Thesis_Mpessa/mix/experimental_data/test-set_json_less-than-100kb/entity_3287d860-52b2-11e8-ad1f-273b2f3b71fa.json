  "textBody" : "Lake Eyre ( ), officially known as Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre, contains the lowest natural point in Australia, at approximately 15 m below sea level (AHD), and, on the rare occasions that it fills, is the largest lake in Australia covering 9500 km2. The shallow endorheic lake is the depocentre of the vast Lake Eyre basin and is found in Northern South Australia, some 700 km north of Adelaide.\n\nWhen the lake is full, it has the same salinity level as the sea, but as the lake dries up and the water evaporates, salinity increases.\n\nThe lake was named in honour of Edward John Eyre, who was the first European to see it, in 1840. The lake's official name was changed in December 2012 to combine the name \"Lake Eyre\" with the indigenous name, Kati Thanda. The native title over the lake and surrounding region is held by the Arabana people.\n\nGeography\n\nKati Thanda–Lake Eyre is located in the deserts of central Australia, in northern South Australia. The Lake Eyre Basin is a large endorheic system surrounding the lakebed, the lowest part of which is filled with the characteristic salt pan caused by the seasonal expansion and subsequent evaporation of the trapped waters. Even in the dry season there is usually some water remaining in Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre, normally collecting in over 200 smaller sub-lakes within its margins. The lake was formed by aeolian processes after tectonic upwarping occurred to the south subsequent to the end of the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nDuring the rainy season the rivers from the north-east part of the Lake Eyre Basin (in outback (south-west and central) Queensland) flow towards the lake through the Channel Country. The amount of water from the monsoon determines whether water will reach the lake and if it does, how deep the lake will get. The average rainfall in the area of the lake is 100 to per year.\n\nThe  altitude usually attributed to Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre refers to the deepest parts of the lake floor, in Belt Bay and the Madigan Gulf. The shoreline lies at .[http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/oce/oce-04.html Lake Eyre]. International Lake Environment Committee. Retrieved 29 March 2012. The lake is the area of maximum deposition of sediment in the Lake Eyre Basin.\n\nLake Eyre is divided into two sections which are joined by the Goyder Channel. These are known as Lake Eyre North, which is 144 km in length and 65 km wide, and Lake Eyre South, which measures 65 by. The salt crusts are thickest (up to 50 cm) in the southern Belt Bay, Jackboot Bay and Madigan Gulf sub-basins of Lake Eyre North.Dulhunty, J.A. (1990): Lake Eyre, In: M.J. Tyler, C.R. Twidale, M. Davis and C.B. Walker, Natural History of the North East Deserts. Royal Society of South Australia Inc. Pp. 101-4. \n\nSince 1883, proposals have been made to flood Lake Eyre with seawater brought to the basin via a canal or pipeline. The purpose was, in part, to increase evaporation and thereby increase rainfall in the region downwind of an enlarged Lake Eyre.Badescu, V., Cathcart, R.B., Bolonkin, A.A., Paulescu, M. and Gravila, P. (2013) Macro-engineering Australia's Lake Eyre with imported seawater. International Journal of Environment and Sustainable Development 12: 264-284.

If brine water was not sent back to the ocean, it would precipitate 90000 LT of salt every year.\n\nSalinity\n\nThe salinity in the lake increases as the 450 mm salt crust dissolves over a period of six months of a major flood resulting in a massive fish kill. When over 4 m deep the lake is no more salty than the sea, but salinity increases as the water evaporates, with saturation occurring at about a 500 mm depth. The lake takes on a pink hue when saturated due to the presence of beta-carotene pigment caused by the algae Dunaliella salina.\n\nFloods\n\nTypically a  flood occurs every three years, a 4 m flood every decade, and a fill or near fill a few times a century. The water in the lake soon evaporates with a minor or medium flood drying by the end of the following summer. Most of the water entering the lakes arrives via Warburton River.\n\nIn strong La Niña years the lake can fill. Since 1885 this has occurred in 1886–1887, 1889–1890, 1916–1917, 1950, 1955, 1974–1977,Allen, Robert J.; The Australasian Summer Monsoon, Teleconnections, and Flooding in the Lake Eyre Basin; published 1985 by Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, S.A. Branch;  and 1999–2001,Australian Bureau of Meteorology; Annual Climate Summary (2000) with the highest flood of 6 m in 1974. Local rain can also fill Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre to 3 – as occurred in 1984 and 1989. Torrential rain in January 2007 took about six weeks to reach the lake but only placed a small amount of water into it.\n\nWhen recently flooded the lake is almost fresh and native freshwater fish, including bony bream (Nematolosa erebi), the Lake Eyre Basin sub-species of golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and various small hardyhead species (Craterocephalus spp.) can survive in it. \n\n2009 to 2011\n\nThe 2009 Lake Eyre flood peaked at  deep in late May, which is a quarter of its maximum recorded depth of 6 m. 9 km3 of water crossed the Queensland–South Australian border with most of it coming from massive floods in the Georgina River. However, owing to the very low rainfall in the lower reaches of these rivers (contrasting with heavy rainfall in the upper catchments)[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/annual_sum/2009/AnClimSum09_HR1.1.pdf Australian Annual Climate Summary 2009] the greater proportion soaked into the desert or evaporated en route to the lake, leaving less than 4 km3 in the lake which covered an area of 800 km2 or 12% of the total. As the flood did not start filling the lake's deepest point (Belt Bay) until late March, little bird life appeared preferring instead to nest in the upper reaches of the Lake Eyre Basin, north of Birdsville, where large lakes appeared in January as a result of monsoonal rain.\n\nThe high rainfall in summer 2010 sent flood water into the Diamantina, Georgina and Cooper Creek catchments of the Lake Eyre basin, with the Cooper Creek reaching the lake for the first time since 1990. The higher rainfall has prompted many different birds to migrate back to the area for breeding.[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/lake-eyre-floods-again.htm/ Lake Eyre floods again], Australian Geographic, 15 July 2010\n\nHeavy local rain in early March 2011 in the Stuart Creek and Warriner catchments filled Lake Eyre South, with Lake Eyre North about 75 per cent covered with water firstly from the Neales and Macumba Rivers, and later from the Warburton River.\n\n2015 to 2016 \n\nIn late 2015, water began flowing into Lake Eyre following heavy rain in the north-east of the state.\n\nYacht club\n\nThe Lake Eyre Yacht Club is a dedicated group of sailors who sail on the lake's floods, including recent trips in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2009.[http://www.lakeeyreyc.com Welcome to the Lake Eyre Yacht Club].

The Cooper had reached Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre for the first time since 1990.\n\nWhen the lake is full, a notable phenomenon is that around midday the surface can often become very flat. The surface then reflects the sky in a way that leaves both the horizon and water surface virtually impossible to see. The commodore of the Lake Eyre Yacht Club has stated that sailing during this time has the appearance of sailing in the sky.\n\nLand speed record attempts\n\nKati Thanda–Lake Eyre has been a site for various land speed record attempts on its salt flats, especially those by Donald Campbell with the Bluebird-Proteus CN7.\n\nWildlife\n\nPhytoplankton in the lake includes Nodularia spumigena and a number of species of Dunaliella.\n\nBirds\n\nBirds such as pelicans and banded stilts are drawn to a filled lake from southern coastal regions of Australia, and from as far afield as Papua New Guinea. During the 1989–1990 flood it was estimated that 200,000 pelicans, 80% of Australia's total population, came to feed & roost at Lake Eyre.
