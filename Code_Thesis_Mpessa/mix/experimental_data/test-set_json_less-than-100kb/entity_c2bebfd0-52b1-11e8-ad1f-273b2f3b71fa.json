Most notably, she was the food editor of The New York Times Magazine, the editor of T Living, a quarterly publication of The New York Times, author of The Essential New York Times Cookbook which was a New York Times bestseller, and co-founder and CEO of Food52.\n\nAfter finishing her first book, in 1997, Hesser was hired as a food reporter for The New York Times where she wrote more than 750 stories. While at the Times Hesser wrote about the influence of Costco on the wine industry, uncovered the politics behind the New York City Greenmarket  and was among the first to write about Ferran Adria of El Bulli in a major American publication.\n\nHesser was involved in two cases of conflict of interest while working at the Times.
