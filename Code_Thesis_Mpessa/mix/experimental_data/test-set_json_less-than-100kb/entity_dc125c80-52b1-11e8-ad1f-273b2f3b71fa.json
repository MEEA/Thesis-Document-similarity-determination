  "textBody" : "Charles McCarry (born in 1930, in Massachusetts, United States) is an American writer, primarily of spy fiction, and a former undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency who The Wall Street Journal described in 2013 as the dean of American spy writers; The New Republic magazine calls him \"poet laureate of the CIA.\";August 4, 1979, pp. 42–43. and Otto Penzler says he has produced some \"poetic masterpieces.\"Agents of Change, p. xiii. William Zinsser calls him a \"political novelist:\"Zinsser, William, \"Paths of Resistance: the Art and Craft of the Political Novel,\" 1989.Jonathan Yardley, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Washington Post, calls him a \"'serious' novelist\" whose work may include \"the best novel ever written about life in high-stakes Washington, DC.\"\"The Powers that Be,\" Washington Post, June 4, 1995.\n\nEarly life\n\nHis family is from The Berkshires area of western Massachusetts, and he currently lives in Virginia.\n\nApproach to writing\n\nMcCarry believes that \"the best novels are about ordinary things: love, betrayal, death, trust, loneliness, marriage, fatherhood.\"McCarry, Charles, \"A Strip of Exposed Film, \" in \n'Paths of Resistance, p. 69.  He also says \"if you write a political novel, you're writing what you believe instead of what you know.\"\n\nMcCarry says, \"the themes of my novels have been ordinary things -- love, death, betrayal and the American dream.\"\n\nMcCarry's books are not thrillers; thrillers maintain suspense mostly by letting the reader know more than does the character being depicted; e,g, someone with a knife is waiting in the dark room.  In contrast, as you read a Paul Christopher novel,you rarely see or know anything that Christopher does not see and know.\n\nIn a 1988 essay published in the Washington Post, McCarry writes, \"[I]n 1973 when I turned in the manuscript of my novel The Tears of Autumn, [the publisher] summoned me to New York and, in his office high above lower Park Avenue, banged the manuscript on his desk.\"This book is talky, it's slow, and nobody is going to believe a goddamn word of the plot,\" he said. \"Where's the car chase? Where's the torture scene? Where's the sex? Where's the good Russian? Do you call this a thriller?\"\n\"No,\" I said. He didn't hear me.\"McCarry, Charles, \"How to Write Spy Novels; the Best Books are Collaborations Between the Writer and Reader,\" June 19, 1988.\n\nMcCarry writes that: \"After I resigned [from the CIA], intending to spend the rest of my life writing fiction and knowing what tricks the mind can play when the gates are thrown wide open, as they are by the act of writing, between the imagination and that part of the brain in which information is stored, I took the precaution of writing a closely remembered narrative of my clandestine experiences. After correcting the manuscript, I burned it.\nWhat I kept for my own use was the atmosphere of secret life: How it worked on the five senses and what it did to the heart and mind. All the rest went up in flames, setting me free henceforth to make it all up. In all important matters, such as the creation of characters and the invention of plots, with rare and minor exceptions, that is what I have done. And, as might be expected, when I have been weak enough to use something that really happened as an episode in a novel, it is that piece of scrap, buried in a landfill of the imaginary, readers invariably refuse to believe.\"McCarry, Charles, \"Between the Real and the Believable,\" Washington Post, December 11, 1994.\n\nThroughout McCarry's fiction are statements and descriptions such as \"the average intelligence officer is a sort of latter-day Marcel Proust.  He lies abed in a cork-lined room, hoping to profit by secrets that other people slip under the door.\"McCarry, Charles, \"The End of the String,\" a short story published in Agents of Change, 2010, p. 7.\n\nSnippets from McCarry's CIA years can be found in his non-fiction writing for newspapers. For example,\"In the early days of the cold war, a colleague of mine who had worked his way through college playing the saxophone was recruited by a certain United States intelligence agency. For his first assignment, he was posted to Cambodia and told to find an apartment near the royal palace, open the windows at night, and play “Muskrat Ramble.” Prince Sihanouk, the eccentric ruler of the country, was reputed to be an amateur musician who loved jazz and had his own band. Who knew but what he might hear that plaintive sax in the jungle night and invite the nice young American to come on over and sit in?\"McCarry, Charles, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11mccarry.html \"Under Cover of Ineptitude\"], The New York Times, July 10, 2010.\n\nMcCarry's first published novel came out in 1973, which means he was 43;McCarry was born in 1930, and The Mierick Dossier came out in 1973. in contrast, most successful novelists have their first novel published while they are still in their twenties.Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926 when he was 27; and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead was published in 1948, when Mailer was 25.\n\nA critic for Tin House magazine approaches McCarry through what the critic calls \"the art of the sentence,\"  citing as an example a description in the opening pages of McCarry's The Secret Lovers: “The sun shone feebly through the overcast, like a lamp covered by a woman’s scarf in a shabby hotel room.”\"The Art of the Sentence,\" Tin House',  January 8, 2013.\n\nA recurrent statement found in McCarry's non-fiction writing is that events in real life are so strange that if presented as fiction no one would believe them.e.g.\"Under Cover of Ineptitude,\" NYT, July 10, 2010.\n\nMcCarry's novels were all republished in 2005—which means major critics revisited his work—some of which was more than a third-of-a-century old  Rereading The Tears of Autumn one critic called it \"a perfect spy novel.\"\n\nCareer\n\nMilitary, U.S. presidential speechwriter, CIA\n\nMcCarry began his writing career in the United States Army as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, afterwards, in the 1950s, serving as a speechwriter in the early Administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower;Agents of Treachery, pp. xii-xiii a typical McCarry item was the 1953 Labor Day Proclamation, which read, in part, \"Free American labor has won for itself the enjoyment of a standard of living unmatched in history. The contemporary world knows no comparison with it. There is only brutal contrast to it. To this, there is no more pitiful and dramatic testimony than the food which this free people has been able to send to feed hundreds of thousands suffering the peculiar torments of the proletarian paradise of Eastern Germany.\"[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9691 Labor Day Statement by the President], September 7, 1953, Dwight D.

But since no one can claim to have read every America espionage novel ever written, let’s just say that The Tears of Autumn is a perfect spy novel, and that its hero, Paul Christopher, should by all rights be known the world over as the thinking man’s James Bond — and woman’s too.\"—Brendan Bernard, \"The Great American Spy Novel,\" March 31, 2005', LA Weekly\n\n\"Old Boys is a large yarn that will make yummy reading between long looks at Nantucket Sound this summer. (And a boffo movie in the right hands.) But it is a tale that travels from the outlandish to the absurd. As long as readers don't expect the taut realism we have come to expect from the man, they'll be fine. If they're looking for vintage McCarry, though, this will produce unhappy campers. The book does not approach his better grownup fiction. It is not in the same league, for example, with The Miernik Dossier, the small gem that made McCarry's career. Rather, it is something of a \"Treasure Island\" for lovers of spook fiction, a near-juvenile adventure that entrances adults who know better with fabulous writing. What they do get is a fleeting reprise of McCarry's great creation, Paul Christopher. Christopher, the spy whom many first met in McCarry's bestseller The Tears of Autumn, is now an opaque older man and an ascetic survivor of a Chinese prison camp.\"--Sam Allis, \"McCarry's thriller 'Old Boys' is a trip past believable,\" Boston Globe, July 26, 2004.\n\nMcCarry and the JFK assassination in real life and in his fiction\n\n--\"...the most credible account of President Kennedy’s assassination.

Times (2006): \"McCarry never succumbs to a bogus moral equivalence in which Western operatives are as nefarious as their Communist counterparts. He instructs us that the real problem is not so much moral quicksand as incompetent scheming. At a moment when the C.I.A.'s travails are evoking nostalgia for a golden age when it supposedly operated effectively, McCarry offers a useful reminder that such an era never existed.\"\"Old-Fashioned Espionage,\" April 2, 2006\n\n--\"The truth, once discovered, is of no use: people deny what they have done, forget what they had believed, and make the same mistakes over and over again.\"From Tears of Autumn with a few word changes, e.g. \"men\" to \"people.\"—Paul Christopher is eating dinner with a beautiful young woman in wartime Saigon.

In the nonfiction Inner Circles, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers hang \"one step\" snakes from the ceilings of their tunnels to kill American GI \"tunnel rats\" who crawl in; to McCarry, these tunnel rats seem to epitomize courage.Inner Circles, p. xxx.\n\nSatire\n\n* In' Shelley's Heart, published in 1995 and set about ten years in the future, \"among militant feminists the surname Eve had lately come into fashion as an alternative to what they termed the 'chattel names' that had been imposed on them by the males who had impregnated their female ancestors.\"p. 125.\n* A close aide to President John F. Kennedy praises him for \"grabbing his putter\" in the Oval Office, \"lining up a shot and tapping it across the rug\" as he makes a difficult decision.  Adds the aide, \"we all suddenly saw the golf ball as the symbol of the fate of the nation.\"--The Tears of Autumnp. 71.\n\nMcCarry v. LeCarre\n\n* Le Carre did not like American intelligence officers, and was often “heavy-handed” in depicting them;David Igantius, \"Le Carre goes Back into the Cold\", The Atlantic, September 2017.  McCarry treats all intelligence professionals, even from small countries like South Vietnam,see  The Secret Lovers and Tears of Autumn as equal.\n* Unlike LeCarre's work, which focuses only on the Cold War and post-Cold War time periods, McCarry explores pre-independence America (Bride of the Wilderness), and has several works set in the near future (e.g. Shelley's Heart)--and one that could qualify as science fiction (Ark).\n* McCarry is compared to LeCarre, but LeCarre never seems to be compared to McCarry.\n* McCarry's fiction started to be published in the 1970s, after he had left the CIA; publication of LeCarre's work began in the early 1960s, while he still worked for British intelligence.Patrick Anderson, \"The Spymaster Adds to his rich legacy\", Washington Post, September 2, 2017.\n* Both seem to abhor torture (LeCarre: \"The tortured are a class apart.

In its subtitle, Furst's book calls such writing \"literary espionage.\"\n\n* \"His flight was called over the loudspeaker in Thai; he waited for the English announcement...so no one watching him should guess he knew the local language.\"--The Tears of Autumn, 1974.p. 131.\n* \"Good intelligence officers...knew how to form friendships and use friends\"—at addition, \"no human action surprised [them] or touched their emotions.\"The Tears of Autumn, p. 34.\n* \"In those days, more than half a century ago, when an American was a rare bird along the Guinea coast, you got to know everyone in your hotel bar pretty quickly.\"--\"The End of the String,\" 2011.In Harlan Coben, The Best American Mystery Stories.\n\nPredicting the near-term future\n\nMcCarry on being alone\n\n* \"Paul Christopher had been loved by two women who could not understand why he had stopped writing poetry.\"  The Tears of Autumn\n* \"Solitude and time-wasting did not bother me; I was used to both; both were occupational hazards.\"\"The End of the String\"\n* \"In time, I supposed, I would get used to laughing alone.\"—Last line of The Mulberry Bush (2015)\n* McCarry's heroes often love women who are forever unattainable (Christopher's Ghosts) or more committed to ideology and than to romantic love (Mulberry Bush).\n* The fundamental concept in McCarry's fiction is that every human being is alone.\n\nAdaptations in other media\n\nThe film Wrong is Right (1982), starring Sean Connery, was loosely based on McCarry's novel, The Better Angels (1979).\n\nPaul Christopher, J. D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield, and J. P. Donleavy's Sebastion Dangerfield in The Ginger Man (1955) are among the post-World War II literary heroes who have stymied Hollywood efforts to depict them.see \"J.P.

Who knew but what he might hear that plaintive sax in the jungle night and invite the nice young American to come on over and sit in?\"McCarry, Charles, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11mccarry.html \"Under Cover of Ineptitude\"], The New York Times, July 10, 2010.\n\nMcCarry's first published novel came out in 1973, which means he was 43;McCarry was born in 1930, and The Mierick Dossier came out in 1973. in contrast, most successful novelists have their first novel published while they are still in their twenties.Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926 when he was 27; and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead was published in 1948, when Mailer was 25.\n\nA critic for Tin House magazine approaches McCarry through what the critic calls \"the art of the sentence,\"  citing as an example a description in the opening pages of McCarry's The Secret Lovers: “The sun shone feebly through the overcast, like a lamp covered by a woman’s scarf in a shabby hotel room.”\"The Art of the Sentence,\" Tin House',  January 8, 2013.\n\nA recurrent statement found in McCarry's non-fiction writing is that events in real life are so strange that if presented as fiction no one would believe them.e.g.\"Under Cover of Ineptitude,\" NYT, July 10, 2010.\n\nMcCarry's novels were all republished in 2005—which means major critics revisited his work—some of which was more than a third-of-a-century old  Rereading The Tears of Autumn one critic called it \"a perfect spy novel.\"\n\nCareer\n\nMilitary, U.S. presidential speechwriter, CIA\n\nMcCarry began his writing career in the United States Army as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, afterwards, in the 1950s, serving as a speechwriter in the early Administration of President Dwight D.

But since no one can claim to have read every America espionage novel ever written, let’s just say that The Tears of Autumn is a perfect spy novel, and that its hero, Paul Christopher, should by all rights be known the world over as the thinking man’s James Bond — and woman’s too.\"—Brendan Bernard, \"The Great American Spy Novel,\" March 31, 2005', LA Weekly\n\n\"Old Boys is a large yarn that will make yummy reading between long looks at Nantucket Sound this summer. (And a boffo movie in the right hands.) But it is a tale that travels from the outlandish to the absurd. As long as readers don't expect the taut realism we have come to expect from the man, they'll be fine. If they're looking for vintage McCarry, though, this will produce unhappy campers. The book does not approach his better grownup fiction. It is not in the same league, for example, with The Miernik Dossier, the small gem that made McCarry's career. Rather, it is something of a \"Treasure Island\" for lovers of spook fiction, a near-juvenile adventure that entrances adults who know better with fabulous writing. What they do get is a fleeting reprise of McCarry's great creation, Paul Christopher. Christopher, the spy whom many first met in McCarry's bestseller The Tears of Autumn, is now an opaque older man and an ascetic survivor of a Chinese prison camp.\"--Sam Allis, \"McCarry's thriller 'Old Boys' is a trip past believable,\" Boston Globe, July 26, 2004.\n\nMcCarry and the JFK assassination in real life and in his fiction\n\n--\"...the most credible account of President Kennedy’s assassination.

In real life, the wife of one of Diem's murdered brothers attracted media attention for predicting the JFK assassination (\"Anything that happens in Vietnam will find its equivalent in the United States\"), and later telling reporters that JFK had got what he deserved.NYT, \"Mrs. Nhu Recalls Saigon Coup In a Message to Mrs. Kennedy,\" November 25, 1963.—JFK is the only real-life President mentioned by name in a McCarry novel.\n\n--The most famous and successfil Soviet espionage novelist (closely associated with the KGB) during the Cold War--Yulian Semyonova—wrote that a \"right-wing conspiracy\" had killed JFK.\n\nMcCarry's fiction: Insights into the CIA\n\n* In The Better Angels (1979) and its sequel, Shelley's Heart (1995), McCarry imagines a Washington, D.C. in which the CIA has been disbanded \"after it collapsed under the weight of the failures and scandals resulting from its misuse by twentieth century Presidents,\" and has been replaced by a FIS (Foreign Intelligence Service).Shelley's Heart, p. 16.\n* The New York Times: \"As usual, Mr. McCarry displays the inside scraps of knowledge he has picked up presumably from working in the C.I.A. and writing memoirs with the likes of the former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the former Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan.

Times (2006): \"McCarry never succumbs to a bogus moral equivalence in which Western operatives are as nefarious as their Communist counterparts. He instructs us that the real problem is not so much moral quicksand as incompetent scheming. At a moment when the C.I.A.'s travails are evoking nostalgia for a golden age when it supposedly operated effectively, McCarry offers a useful reminder that such an era never existed.\"\"Old-Fashioned Espionage,\" April 2, 2006\n\n--\"The truth, once discovered, is of no use: people deny what they have done, forget what they had believed, and make the same mistakes over and over again.\"From Tears of Autumn with a few word changes, e.g. \"men\" to \"people.\"—Paul Christopher is eating dinner with a beautiful young woman in wartime Saigon.

In the nonfiction Inner Circles, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers hang \"one step\" snakes from the ceilings of their tunnels to kill American GI \"tunnel rats\" who crawl in; to McCarry, these tunnel rats seem to epitomize courage.Inner Circles, p. xxx.\n\nSatire\n\n* In' Shelley's Heart, published in 1995 and set about ten years in the future, \"among militant feminists the surname Eve had lately come into fashion as an alternative to what they termed the 'chattel names' that had been imposed on them by the males who had impregnated their female ancestors.\"p. 125.\n* A close aide to President John F. Kennedy praises him for \"grabbing his putter\" in the Oval Office, \"lining up a shot and tapping it across the rug\" as he makes a difficult decision.  Adds the aide, \"we all suddenly saw the golf ball as the symbol of the fate of the nation.\"--The Tears of Autumnp. 71.\n\nMcCarry v. LeCarre\n\n* Le Carre did not like American intelligence officers, and was often “heavy-handed” in depicting them;David Igantius, \"Le Carre goes Back into the Cold\", The Atlantic, September 2017.  McCarry treats all intelligence professionals, even from small countries like South Vietnam,see  The Secret Lovers and Tears of Autumn as equal.\n* Unlike LeCarre's work, which focuses only on the Cold War and post-Cold War time periods, McCarry explores pre-independence America (Bride of the Wilderness), and has several works set in the near future (e.g. Shelley's Heart)--and one that could qualify as science fiction (Ark).\n* McCarry is compared to LeCarre, but LeCarre never seems to be compared to McCarry.\n* McCarry's fiction started to be published in the 1970s, after he had left the CIA; publication of LeCarre's work began in the early 1960s, while he still worked for British intelligence.Patrick Anderson, \"The Spymaster Adds to his rich legacy\", Washington Post, September 2, 2017.\n* Both seem to abhor torture (LeCarre: \"The tortured are a class apart.

D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield, and J. P. Donleavy's Sebastion Dangerfield in The Ginger Man (1955) are among the post-World War II literary heroes who have stymied Hollywood efforts to depict them.see \"J.P.
