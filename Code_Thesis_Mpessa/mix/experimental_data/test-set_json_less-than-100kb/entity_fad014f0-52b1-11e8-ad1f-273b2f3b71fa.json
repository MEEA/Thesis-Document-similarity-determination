  "textBody" : "\"Rage Hard\" is the fifth single by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It was released on 25 August 1986.\n\nBackground\n\nHaving topped the charts around the world with Welcome to the Pleasuredome and its accompanying singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood took off to Amsterdam to record the follow-up album, Liverpool. Taking on a rockier edge, \"Rage Hard\" was the first single culled from the disc.\n\nThe single's title came from the Dylan Thomas poem \"Do not go gentle into that good night\".\n\nOf note, \"Rage Hard\" was a testament to the changing musical landscape in Britain at the time. It was not only the first Frankie single to be featured on CD single, it was also the first single to not feature a cassette release - new rules limited the number items that could count towards the official charts, following the earlier ZTT excesses.\n\n\"Rage Hard\" eventually hit Number 4 in the UK singles charts and Number 1 in Germany (for two weeks), #5 in Switzerland, #7 in the Netherlands, #12 in Austria, #19 in Sweden and #32 in France.\n\nB-sides \n\nThe b-sides to \"Rage Hard\" were, for the most part, straight forward cover songs. Firstly there was a cover of David Bowie's 1972 glam-rock classic \"Suffragette City\", slightly renamed to \"SuffRAGEtte City\" to fit in with the \"Rage Hard\" promotion. The second cover song was \"Roadhouse Blues\" by The Doors which featured on the 2nd 12\". A shorter version features on the CD single.\n\nThe original b-side is an odd composition entitled \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\". It was released in two versions, a 4-minute mix and a 6-minute mix and featured Holly Johnson & Brian (Nasher) Nash imitating Count von Count (\"Ha ha ha/I am the Count\") from the children's TV show 'Sesame Street'. This was complemented by sampled burps and belches over a backing track.\n\nTrack listing\n\n7\": ZTT / ZTAS 22 United Kingdom \n\n\"rage rage\"\n\n# \"Rage Hard\" (7\" mix) - 5:05\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 4:03\n* The standard release features all five coloured fists on the cover\n* 20,000 copies in a pop-up gatefold sleeve (with the Rage Hard fists being the pop-up) (sleeve featured the Orange fist) (ZTD22)\n\n7\": ZTT / ZTAX 22 United Kingdom \n\n# \"Rage Hard\" (stamped) - 4:55\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 4:03\n\n* The dance mix of Rage Hard was an edit of the \"Broad Mix\" from the 2nd 12\" (sleeve featured the Blue fist)\n (All discographical information pertains to UK releases only)\n\n12\": ZTT / 12 ZTAS 22 United Kingdom \n\n\"Slam Bam\"\n\n# \"Rage Hard\" ⊕ - 12:08\n# \"[The B-side]\" + \"SuffRAGEtte City\" (David Bowie) - 3:31\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 6:15\n# \"['always note the sequencer...']\" + \"[The End]\" -0:22\n* An edit (10:05) of this mix is also known as \"Young Person's Guide To The 12-inch\"\n* This 12\" was also released with a 12\" x 24\" poster (12 ZTAQ 22), 20,000 copies.\n* Also released on German CD (Island / 658 434)\n\n12\": ZTT / 12 ZTAX 22 United Kingdom \n\n# \"Rage Hard\" (Broad Mix) - 8:36\n# \"Roadhouse Blues\" (the full version) - 4:03\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 6:15\n# \"['always note the sequencer...']\" + \"[The End]\" -0:22\n\n* (sleeve featured the Yellow fist)\n* Note: 12ZTAX22 also came in a limited edition cardboard box which was designed to contain the complete set of Rage Hard UK releases.
