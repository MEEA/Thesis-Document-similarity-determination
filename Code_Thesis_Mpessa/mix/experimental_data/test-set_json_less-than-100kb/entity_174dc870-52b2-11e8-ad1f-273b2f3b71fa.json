  "textBody" : "The Iron Age is the final epoch of  the three-age system, preceded by the Stone Age (Neolithic) and the Bronze Age. It is an archaeological era in the prehistory and protohistory of Europe and the Ancient Near East, and by analogy also used of other parts of the Old World.\nThe three-age system was introduced in the first half of the 19th century for the archaeology of Europe in particular, and by the later 19th century expanded to the archaeology of the Ancient Near East.Its name harks back to the mythological \"Ages of Man\" of Hesiod. As an archaeological era it was first introduced for Scandinavia by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in the 1830s.\nBy the 1860s, it is embraced as a useful division of the \"earliest history of mankind\" in general (\nKarl von Rotteck, Karl Theodor Welcker, Das Staats-Lexikon (1864), [https://books.google.ch/books?idkgL__ooMXj0C&pg\nPA774  p. 774] and begins to be applied in Assyriology.\nThe development of the now-conventional periodization in the archaeology of the Ancient Near East is developed in the 1920s to 1930s. Oriental Institute Communications, Issues 13-19, Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 1922, p. 55.\n\nAs its name suggests, Iron Age technology is characterized by the production of tools and weaponry by ferrous metallurgy (ironworking), more specifically from carbon steel.\n\nThe duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration. It is defined by archaeological convention, and the mere presence of cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture; rather, the term \"Iron Age\" implies that the production of carbon steel has been perfected to the point where mass production of tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become possible. \nIn the Ancient Near East, this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse, in the 12th century BC. The technology soon spreads throughout the Mediterranean region and to South Asia. \nIts further spread to Central Asia, Eastern and Central Europe is somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe is reached still later, by about 500 BC.\n\nThe Iron Age is taken to end, also by convention, with the beginning of the historiographical record.\nThis usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC (considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus) is usually taken as a cut-off date, in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC. The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. AD 800, with the beginning Viking Age.\n\nThe extension of the term \"Iron Age\" to the archaeology of South, East and Southeast Asia is more recent, and may be used loosely.\nIn South Asia, the Iron Age is taken to begin with the ironworking Painted Gray Ware culture and to end with the reign of Ashoka (3rd century BC). \nIn the prehistory of East and Southeast Asia, the term \"Iron Age\" is not well-defined and may be used more loosely.\nThe Sahel (Sudan region) and Sub-Saharan Africa are outside of the  three-age system, there being no Bronze Age, ¨but the term \"Iron Age\" is sometimes used in reference to early cultures practicing ironworking such as \nthe Nok culture of Nigeria.\n\nChronology\n\nIncreasingly the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the Bronze Age collapse in the ancient Near East, in ancient India (with the post-Rigvedic Vedic civilization), ancient Iran, and ancient Greece (with the Greek Dark Ages). In other regions of Europe the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in Central Europe and the 6th century BC in Northern Europe. The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200–1000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous Late Bronze Age. There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th centuries BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country, Transjordan and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the Aramaean and Sea People groups. There is evidence, however, of strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\n\nThe Iron Age as an archaeological period is roughly defined as that part of the prehistory of a culture or region during which ferrous metallurgy was the dominant technology of metalworking. The periodization is not strictly tied to the presence of ferrous metallurgy and is to some extent a matter of convention. \n\nThe characteristic of an Iron Age culture is mass production of tools and weapons made from steel, typically  alloys with a carbon content between approximately 0.30% and 1.2% by weight. \nOnly with the capability of the production of carbon steel does ferrous metallurgy result in tools or weapons that are equal or superior to bronze. A range of techniques have been used to produce steel from smelted iron, including techniques such as case-hardening and forge welding were used to make cutting edges stronger.\n\nBy convention, the Iron Age in the Ancient Near East is taken to last from c. 1200 BC (the Bronze Age collapse) to c. 550 BC (or 539 BC), taken as the beginning of historiography (Herodotus) or the end of the proto-historical period.\nIn Central and Western Europe, the Iron Age is taken to last from c. 800 BC to c. 1 BC, in \nNorthern Europe from c. 500 BC to 800 AD.\nIn China, there is no recognizable prehistoric period characterized by ironworking, as Bronze Age China transitions almost directly into the Qin dynasty of imperial China; \"Iron Age\" in the context of China is sometimes used for the transitonal period of c. 500 BC to 100 BC during which ferrous metallurgy was present even if not dominant. \n\nThe following gives an overview over the different conventions delimiting the \"Iron Age\" for various regions of the Old World, with indication of the subsequent historical epoch.\n\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = width:700 height:160 left:100 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.12,1) #\n    id:iron value:rgb(1,0.4,0.4) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:-1401 till:1400\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-1200\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-1200\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  bar:Ancient Near East color:iron\n  from: -1200 till: -1000 text:IA1\n  from: -1000 till: -550 text:IA2\n  from:-550 till:-550 shift:(40,-4) text:Achaemenids\n\n  bar:Aegean color:iron\n  from: -1100 till: -800 text:Greek Dark Ages\n  from: -800 till: -480 text:Archaic period\n  from:-480 till:-480 shift:(45,-4) text:Classical Greece\n  bar:Italy color:iron\n  from: -1100 till: -700 text:Villanova\n  from: -700 till: -265 text:Etruscan\n  from:-265 till:-265 shift:(45,-4) text:Roman Italy\n  bar:Central Europe color:iron\n  from: -800 till: -450 text:Hallstatt  \n  from: -450 till: 0 text:La Tène\n  from: 0 till: 0 shift:(45,-4) text:Roman Empire\n\n  bar:Northern Europe color:iron\n  from: -500 till: 0 text:Pre-Roman\n  from: 0 till: 400 text:Roman\n  from: 400 till: 790 text:Germanic\n  from:790 till:790 shift:(40,-4) text:Viking Age \n\n  bar:South Asia color:iron\n  from: -1200 till: -650 text:PGW\n  from: -650 till: -270 text:NBPW\n  from: -270 till: -270 shift:(25,-4) text:Ashoka\n\nEarly ferrous metallurgy\n\nThe earliest-known iron artifacts are nine small beads dated to 3200 BC, which were found in burials at Gerzeh, Lower Egypt. They have been identified as meteoric iron shaped by careful hammering.Rehren T, et al, \"5,000 years old Egyptian iron beads made from hammered meteoritic iron\", Journal of Archaeological Science 2013 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313002057 text]  Meteoric iron, a characteristic iron–nickel alloy, was used by various ancient peoples thousands of years before the Iron Age. Such iron, being in its native metallic state, required no smelting of ores.[https://books.google.com/books?id7VMVguiMmY0C&pg\nPA164 Archaeomineralogy, p. 164], George Robert Rapp, Springer, 2002[https://books.google.com/books?idDaAmwiJ4rnEC&pg\nPA125 Understanding materials science, p. 125], Rolf E. Hummel, Springer, 2004\n\nSmelted iron appears sporadically in the archeological record from the middle Bronze Age. Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, its high melting point of  placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC. Tin's low melting point of  and copper's relatively moderate melting point of  placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns, which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than .James E. McClellan III; Harold Dorn. [https://books.google.com/books?id\naJgp94zNwNQC Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction]. JHU Press; 14 April 2006. . p. 21. In addition to specially designed furnaces, ancient iron production needed to develop complex procedures for the removal of impurities, for regulating the admixture of carbon in combination with hot-working to achieve a useful balance of hardness and strength (steel) and for adding alloys to prevent rust; see Ferrous metallurgy.\n\nThe earliest tentative evidence for iron-making is a small number of iron fragments with the appropriate amounts of carbon admixture found in the Proto-Hittite layers at Kaman-Kalehöyük and dated to 2200–2000 BC. Akanuma (2008) concludes that \"The combination of carbon dating, archaeological context, and archaeometallurgical examination indicates that it is likely that the use of ironware made of steel had already begun in the third millennium BC in Central Anatolia\".  Souckova-Siegolová (2001) shows that iron implements were made in Central Anatolia in very limited quantities around 1800 BC and were in general use by elites, though not by commoners, during the New Hittite Empire (∼1400–1200 BC)..\n\nSimilarly, recent archaeological remains of iron working in the Ganges Valley in India have been tentatively dated to 1800 BC. Tewari (2003) concludes that \"knowledge of iron smelting and manufacturing of iron artifacts was well known in the Eastern Vindhyas and iron had been in use in the Central Ganga Plain, at least from the early second millennium BC\". By the Middle Bronze Age increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product) appeared in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South Asia. African sites are turning up dates as early as 1200 BC.Duncan E. Miller and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Early Metal Working in Sub Saharan Africa' Journal of African History 35 (1994) 1–36; Minze Stuiver and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Radiocarbon Chronology of the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa' Current Anthropology 1968.[http://www.homestead.com/wysinger/ironage.html How Old is the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa?] – by Roderick J. McIntosh, Archaeological Institute of America (1999)[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/history_in_africa/v032/32.1alpern.pdf Iron in Sub-Saharan Africa] – by Stanley B. Alpern (2005)\n\nModern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large-scale iron production in around 1200 BC, marking the end of the Bronze Age. Between 1200 BC and 1000 BC diffusion in the understanding of iron metallurgy and use of iron objects was fast and far-flung. Anthony SnodgrassA.M.Snodgrass (1966), \"Arms and Armour of the Greeks\". (Thames & Hudson, London)A. M. Snodgrass (1971), \"The Dark Age of Greece\" (Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh). suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC, forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze. As evidence, many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during that time. More widespread use of iron led to improved steel-making technology at lower cost. Thus, even when tin became available again, iron was cheaper, stronger and lighter, and forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently.Theodore Wertime and J. D. Muhly, eds. The Coming of the Age of Iron (New Haven, 1979).\n\nAncient Near East\n\nThe Iron Age in the Ancient Near East is believed to have begun with the discovery of iron smelting and smithing techniques in Anatolia or the Caucasus and Balkans in the late 2nd millennium BC ( 1300 BC).Jane C. Waldbaum, From Bronze to Iron: The Transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the Eastern Mediterranean (Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, vol. LIV, 1978). The earliest bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan around 930 BC (14C dating).\n\nWestern Asia\n\nIn the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, the initial use of iron reaches far back, to perhaps 3000 BC.Chisholm, H. (1910). The Encyclopædia Britannica. New York: The Encyclopædia Britannica Co. One of the earliest smelted iron artifacts known was a dagger with an iron blade found in a Hattic tomb in Anatolia, dating from 2500 BC.Richard Cowen () The Age of Iron Chapter 5 in a series of essays on Geology, History, and People prepares for a course of the University of California at Davis. [http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH5.html Online version]. The widespread use of iron weapons which replaced bronze weapons rapidly disseminated throughout the Near East (North Africa, southwest Asia) by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC.\n\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the Hittites of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. \nAs part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the Bronze Age collapse saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region.\nIt was long held that the success of the Hittite Empire during the Late Bronze Age had been based on the advantages entailed by the \"monopoly\" on ironworking at the time.Muhly, James D. 'Metalworking/Mining in the Levant' pp. 174-183 in Near Eastern Archaeology ed. Suzanne Richard (2003), pp. 179-180. Accordingly, the invading Sea Peoples would have been responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. \nThe view of such a \"Hittite monopoly\" has come under scrutiny and no longer represents a scholarly consensus. \nWhile there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons.Waldbaum, Jane C. From Bronze to Iron.

Bronze remained the primary material there until the conquest by Neo-Assyrian Empire in 671 BC. The explanation of this would seem to lie in the fact that the relics are in most cases the paraphernalia of tombs, the funeral vessels and vases, and iron being considered an impure metal by the ancient Egyptians it was never used in their manufacture of these or for any religious purposes. It was attributed to Seth, the spirit of evil who according to Egyptian tradition governed the central deserts of Africa.\nIn the Black Pyramid of Abusir, dating before 2000 BC, Gaston Maspero found some pieces of iron. In the funeral text of Pepi I, the metal is mentioned. A sword bearing the name of pharaoh Merneptah as well as a battle axe with an iron blade and gold-decorated bronze shaft were both found in the excavation of Ugarit.Richard Cowen, 'The Age of Iron Chapter 5 in a series of essays on Geology, History, and People prepares for a course of the University of California at Davis. [http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH5.html Online version] A dagger with an iron blade found in Tutankhamun's tomb, 13th century BC, was recently examined and found to be of meteoric origin.\nFree full text available.\n\nEurope\n\nIn Europe, the use of iron covers the last years of the prehistoric period and the early years of the historic period. The regional Iron Age may be defined as including the last stages of the prehistoric period and the first of the proto-historic periods.The Junior Encyclopædia Britannica: A reference library of general knowledge. (1897). Chicago: E.G. Melvin. Iron working was introduced to Europe in the late 11th century BC,Riederer, Josef; Wartke, Ralf-B.: \"Iron\", Cancik, Hubert; Schneider, Helmuth (eds.): Brill's New Pauly, Brill 2009 probably from the Caucasus, and slowly spread northwards and westwards over the succeeding 500 years. The widespread use of the technology of iron was implemented in Europe simultaneously with Asia.John Collis, \"The European Iron Age\" (1989)\n\nMuseu da Cultura Castreja (14926282396).jpg|Archaeological artifact from the work developed in the area of Citânia de Briteiros\n23.4.14 Briteiros 109 (14012600704).jpg|Cross or cruzado in Citânia de Briteiros\n23.4.14 Briteiros 055 (13988507706).jpg|Informative plaque of the proto-historic settlement of Citânia de Briteiros\nMuseu da Cultura Castreja (14762739747).jpg|Another artifact from Citânia de Briteiros\nPedra Formosa Briteiros.jpg|A pedra formosa\n\nThe Iron Age in Europe is characterized by an elaboration of designs in weapons, implements, and utensils. These are no longer cast but hammered into shape, and decoration is elaborate curvilinear rather than simple rectilinear; the forms and character of the ornamentation of the northern European weapons resembles in some respects Roman arms, while in other respects they are peculiar and evidently representative of northern art.\n\nCentral Asia\n\nThe Iron Age in Central Asia began when iron objects appear among the Indo-European Saka in present-day Xinjiang between the 10th century BC and the 7th century BC, such as those found at the cemetery site of Chawuhukou.Mark E.

Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period 1800–1200 BC. Archaeological excavations in Hyderabad show an Iron Age burial site. Rakesh TewariDirector of Archaeology, (Uttar Pradesh) believes that around the beginning of the Indian Iron Age (13th century BC), iron smelting was widely practiced in India. Such use suggests that the date of the technology's inception may be around the 16th century BC.\n\nThe beginning of the 1st millennium BC saw extensive developments in iron metallurgy in India. Technological advancement and mastery of iron metallurgy was achieved during this period of peaceful settlements. One iron working centre in east India has been dated to the first millennium BC.Early Antiquity By I. M. Drakonoff. Published 1991. University of Chicago Press. . pg 372 In Southern India (present day Mysore) iron appeared as early as 12th to 11th centuries BC; these developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country.

The large seal script is identified with a group of characters from a book entitled Shĭ Zhoù Piān ( 800 BC). Iron metallurgy reached the Yangzi Valley toward the end of the 6th century BC.Higham, Charles. 1996. The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia The few objects were found at Changsha and Nanjing. The mortuary evidence suggests that the initial use of iron in Lingnan belongs to the mid-to-late Warring States period (from about 350 BC). Important non-precious husi style metal finds include Iron tools found at the tomb at Guwei-cun of the 4th century BC.Encyclopedia of World Art: Landscape in art to Micronesian cultures. McGraw-Hill. 1964.\n\nThe techniques used in Lingnan are a combination of bivalve moulds of distinct southern tradition and the incorporation of piece mould technology from the Zhongyuan. The products of the combination of these two periods are bells, vessels, weapons and ornaments and the sophisticated cast.\n\nAn Iron Age culture of the Tibetan Plateau has tentatively been associated with the Zhang Zhung culture described in early Tibetan writings.\n\nIn Japan, iron items, such as tools, weapons, and decorative objects, are postulated to have entered Japan during the late Yayoi period ( 300 BC–AD 300)[http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/preh.html Prehistoric Archaeological Periods in Japan], Charles T. Keally or the succeeding Kofun period ( AD 250–538), most likely through contacts with the Korean Peninsula and China.\n\nDistinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new pottery styles and the start of intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields. Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Kyūshū to northern Honshū. The Kofun and the subsequent Asuka periods are sometimes referred to collectively as the Yamato period; The word kofun is Japanese for the type of burial mounds dating from that era.\n\nIron objects were introduced to the Korean peninsula through trade with chiefdoms and state-level societies in the Yellow Sea area in the 4th century BC, just at the end of the Warring States Period but before the Western Han Dynasty began.Kim, Do-heon. 2002.

Yoon proposes that iron was first introduced to chiefdoms located along North Korean river valleys that flow into the Yellow Sea such as the Cheongcheon and Taedong Rivers.Yoon, Dong-suk. 1989. Early Iron Metallurgy in Korea. Archaeological Review from Cambridge 8(1):92–99. Iron production quickly followed in the 2nd century BC, and iron implements came to be used by farmers by the 1st century in southern Korea. The earliest known cast-iron axes in southern Korea are found in the Geum River basin. The time that iron production begins is the same time that complex chiefdoms of Proto-historic Korea emerged. The complex chiefdoms were the precursors of early states such as Silla, Baekje, Goguryeo, and GayaBarnes, Gina L. 2001. State Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives.

Sa Huynh beads were made from glass, carnelian, agate, olivine, zircon, gold and garnet; most of these materials were not local to the region, and were most likely imported. Han-Dynasty-style bronze mirrors were also found in Sa Huynh sites. Conversely, Sa Huynh produced ear ornaments have been found in archaeological sites in Central Thailand, Taiwan (Orchid Island).Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., \n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, where there was no continent-wide universal Bronze Age, the use of iron succeeded immediately the use of stone. \nMetallurgy was characterized by the absence of a Bronze Age, and the transition from \"stone to steel\" in tool substances. Early evidence for iron technology in Sub-Saharan Africa can be found at sites such as KM2 and KM3 in northwest Tanzania. Nubia was one of the relatively few places in Africa to have a sustained Bronze Age along with Egypt and much of the rest of North Africa.\n\nVery early copper and bronze working sites in Niger may date to as early as 1500 BC. There is also evidence of iron metallurgy in Termit, Niger from around this period.[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID\n3432&URL_DODO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION\n201.html Iron in Africa: Revising the History, UNESCO] Aux origines de la métallurgie du fer en Afrique, Une ancienneté méconnue: Afrique de l'Ouest et Afrique centrale. \nNubia was a major manufacturer and exporter of iron after the expulsion of the Nubian dynasty from Egypt by the Assyrians in the 7th century BC.Collins, Rober O. and Burns, James M.

    "aggregatedText" : "The Iron Age is the final epoch of  the three-age system, preceded by the Stone Age (Neolithic) and the Bronze Age. It is an archaeological era in the prehistory and protohistory of Europe and the Ancient Near East, and by analogy also used of other parts of the Old World.\nThe three-age system was introduced in the first half of the 19th century for the archaeology of Europe in particular, and by the later 19th century expanded to the archaeology of the Ancient Near East.Its name harks back to the mythological \"Ages of Man\" of Hesiod. As an archaeological era it was first introduced for Scandinavia by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in the 1830s.\nBy the 1860s, it is embraced as a useful division of the \"earliest history of mankind\" in general (\nKarl von Rotteck, Karl Theodor Welcker, Das Staats-Lexikon (1864), [https://books.google.ch/books?idkgL__ooMXj0C&pg\nPA774  p. 774] and begins to be applied in Assyriology.\nThe development of the now-conventional periodization in the archaeology of the Ancient Near East is developed in the 1920s to 1930s. Oriental Institute Communications, Issues 13-19, Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 1922, p. 55.\n\nAs its name suggests, Iron Age technology is characterized by the production of tools and weaponry by ferrous metallurgy (ironworking), more specifically from carbon steel.\n\nThe duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration. It is defined by archaeological convention, and the mere presence of cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture; rather, the term \"Iron Age\" implies that the production of carbon steel has been perfected to the point where mass production of tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become possible. \nIn the Ancient Near East, this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse, in the 12th century BC. The technology soon spreads throughout the Mediterranean region and to South Asia. \nIts further spread to Central Asia, Eastern and Central Europe is somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe is reached still later, by about 500 BC.\n\nThe Iron Age is taken to end, also by convention, with the beginning of the historiographical record.\nThis usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC (considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus) is usually taken as a cut-off date, in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC. The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. AD 800, with the beginning Viking Age.\n\nThe extension of the term \"Iron Age\" to the archaeology of South, East and Southeast Asia is more recent, and may be used loosely.\nIn South Asia, the Iron Age is taken to begin with the ironworking Painted Gray Ware culture and to end with the reign of Ashoka (3rd century BC). \nIn the prehistory of East and Southeast Asia, the term \"Iron Age\" is not well-defined and may be used more loosely.\nThe Sahel (Sudan region) and Sub-Saharan Africa are outside of the  three-age system, there being no Bronze Age, ¨but the term \"Iron Age\" is sometimes used in reference to early cultures practicing ironworking such as \nthe Nok culture of Nigeria.\n\nChronology\n\nIncreasingly the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the Bronze Age collapse in the ancient Near East, in ancient India (with the post-Rigvedic Vedic civilization), ancient Iran, and ancient Greece (with the Greek Dark Ages). In other regions of Europe the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in Central Europe and the 6th century BC in Northern Europe. The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200–1000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous Late Bronze Age. There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th centuries BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country, Transjordan and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the Aramaean and Sea People groups. There is evidence, however, of strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\n\nThe Iron Age as an archaeological period is roughly defined as that part of the prehistory of a culture or region during which ferrous metallurgy was the dominant technology of metalworking. The periodization is not strictly tied to the presence of ferrous metallurgy and is to some extent a matter of convention. \n\nThe characteristic of an Iron Age culture is mass production of tools and weapons made from steel, typically  alloys with a carbon content between approximately 0.30% and 1.2% by weight. \nOnly with the capability of the production of carbon steel does ferrous metallurgy result in tools or weapons that are equal or superior to bronze. A range of techniques have been used to produce steel from smelted iron, including techniques such as case-hardening and forge welding were used to make cutting edges stronger.\n\nBy convention, the Iron Age in the Ancient Near East is taken to last from c. 1200 BC (the Bronze Age collapse) to c. 550 BC (or 539 BC), taken as the beginning of historiography (Herodotus) or the end of the proto-historical period.\nIn Central and Western Europe, the Iron Age is taken to last from c. 800 BC to c. 1 BC, in \nNorthern Europe from c. 500 BC to 800 AD.\nIn China, there is no recognizable prehistoric period characterized by ironworking, as Bronze Age China transitions almost directly into the Qin dynasty of imperial China; \"Iron Age\" in the context of China is sometimes used for the transitonal period of c. 500 BC to 100 BC during which ferrous metallurgy was present even if not dominant. \n\nThe following gives an overview over the different conventions delimiting the \"Iron Age\" for various regions of the Old World, with indication of the subsequent historical epoch.\n\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = width:700 height:160 left:100 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.12,1) #\n    id:iron value:rgb(1,0.4,0.4) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:-1401 till:1400\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-1200\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-1200\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  bar:Ancient Near East color:iron\n  from: -1200 till: -1000 text:IA1\n  from: -1000 till: -550 text:IA2\n  from:-550 till:-550 shift:(40,-4) text:Achaemenids\n\n  bar:Aegean color:iron\n  from: -1100 till: -800 text:Greek Dark Ages\n  from: -800 till: -480 text:Archaic period\n  from:-480 till:-480 shift:(45,-4) text:Classical Greece\n  bar:Italy color:iron\n  from: -1100 till: -700 text:Villanova\n  from: -700 till: -265 text:Etruscan\n  from:-265 till:-265 shift:(45,-4) text:Roman Italy\n  bar:Central Europe color:iron\n  from: -800 till: -450 text:Hallstatt  \n  from: -450 till: 0 text:La Tène\n  from: 0 till: 0 shift:(45,-4) text:Roman Empire\n\n  bar:Northern Europe color:iron\n  from: -500 till: 0 text:Pre-Roman\n  from: 0 till: 400 text:Roman\n  from: 400 till: 790 text:Germanic\n  from:790 till:790 shift:(40,-4) text:Viking Age \n\n  bar:South Asia color:iron\n  from: -1200 till: -650 text:PGW\n  from: -650 till: -270 text:NBPW\n  from: -270 till: -270 shift:(25,-4) text:Ashoka\n\nEarly ferrous metallurgy\n\nThe earliest-known iron artifacts are nine small beads dated to 3200 BC, which were found in burials at Gerzeh, Lower Egypt. They have been identified as meteoric iron shaped by careful hammering.Rehren T, et al, \"5,000 years old Egyptian iron beads made from hammered meteoritic iron\", Journal of Archaeological Science 2013 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313002057 text]  Meteoric iron, a characteristic iron–nickel alloy, was used by various ancient peoples thousands of years before the Iron Age. Such iron, being in its native metallic state, required no smelting of ores.[https://books.google.com/books?id7VMVguiMmY0C&pg\nPA164 Archaeomineralogy, p. 164], George Robert Rapp, Springer, 2002[https://books.google.com/books?idDaAmwiJ4rnEC&pg\nPA125 Understanding materials science, p. 125], Rolf E. Hummel, Springer, 2004\n\nSmelted iron appears sporadically in the archeological record from the middle Bronze Age. Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, its high melting point of  placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC. Tin's low melting point of  and copper's relatively moderate melting point of  placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns, which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than .James E. McClellan III; Harold Dorn. [https://books.google.com/books?id\naJgp94zNwNQC Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction]. JHU Press; 14 April 2006. . p. 21. In addition to specially designed furnaces, ancient iron production needed to develop complex procedures for the removal of impurities, for regulating the admixture of carbon in combination with hot-working to achieve a useful balance of hardness and strength (steel) and for adding alloys to prevent rust; see Ferrous metallurgy.\n\nThe earliest tentative evidence for iron-making is a small number of iron fragments with the appropriate amounts of carbon admixture found in the Proto-Hittite layers at Kaman-Kalehöyük and dated to 2200–2000 BC. Akanuma (2008) concludes that \"The combination of carbon dating, archaeological context, and archaeometallurgical examination indicates that it is likely that the use of ironware made of steel had already begun in the third millennium BC in Central Anatolia\".  Souckova-Siegolová (2001) shows that iron implements were made in Central Anatolia in very limited quantities around 1800 BC and were in general use by elites, though not by commoners, during the New Hittite Empire (∼1400–1200 BC)..\n\nSimilarly, recent archaeological remains of iron working in the Ganges Valley in India have been tentatively dated to 1800 BC. Tewari (2003) concludes that \"knowledge of iron smelting and manufacturing of iron artifacts was well known in the Eastern Vindhyas and iron had been in use in the Central Ganga Plain, at least from the early second millennium BC\". By the Middle Bronze Age increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product) appeared in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South Asia. African sites are turning up dates as early as 1200 BC.Duncan E. Miller and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Early Metal Working in Sub Saharan Africa' Journal of African History 35 (1994) 1–36; Minze Stuiver and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Radiocarbon Chronology of the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa' Current Anthropology 1968.[http://www.homestead.com/wysinger/ironage.html How Old is the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa?] – by Roderick J. McIntosh, Archaeological Institute of America (1999)[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/history_in_africa/v032/32.1alpern.pdf Iron in Sub-Saharan Africa] – by Stanley B. Alpern (2005)\n\nModern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large-scale iron production in around 1200 BC, marking the end of the Bronze Age. Between 1200 BC and 1000 BC diffusion in the understanding of iron metallurgy and use of iron objects was fast and far-flung. Anthony SnodgrassA.M.Snodgrass (1966), \"Arms and Armour of the Greeks\". (Thames & Hudson, London)A. M. Snodgrass (1971), \"The Dark Age of Greece\" (Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh). suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC, forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze. As evidence, many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during that time. More widespread use of iron led to improved steel-making technology at lower cost. Thus, even when tin became available again, iron was cheaper, stronger and lighter, and forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently.Theodore Wertime and J. D. Muhly, eds. The Coming of the Age of Iron (New Haven, 1979).\n\nAncient Near East\n\nThe Iron Age in the Ancient Near East is believed to have begun with the discovery of iron smelting and smithing techniques in Anatolia or the Caucasus and Balkans in the late 2nd millennium BC ( 1300 BC).Jane C. Waldbaum, From Bronze to Iron: The Transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the Eastern Mediterranean (Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, vol. LIV, 1978). The earliest bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan around 930 BC (14C dating).\n\nWestern Asia\n\nIn the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, the initial use of iron reaches far back, to perhaps 3000 BC.Chisholm, H. (1910). The Encyclopædia Britannica. New York: The Encyclopædia Britannica Co. One of the earliest smelted iron artifacts known was a dagger with an iron blade found in a Hattic tomb in Anatolia, dating from 2500 BC.Richard Cowen () The Age of Iron Chapter 5 in a series of essays on Geology, History, and People prepares for a course of the University of California at Davis. [http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH5.html Online version]. The widespread use of iron weapons which replaced bronze weapons rapidly disseminated throughout the Near East (North Africa, southwest Asia) by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC.\n\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the Hittites of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. \nAs part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the Bronze Age collapse saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region.\nIt was long held that the success of the Hittite Empire during the Late Bronze Age had been based on the advantages entailed by the \"monopoly\" on ironworking at the time.Muhly, James D. 'Metalworking/Mining in the Levant' pp. 174-183 in Near Eastern Archaeology ed. Suzanne Richard (2003), pp. 179-180. Accordingly, the invading Sea Peoples would have been responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. \nThe view of such a \"Hittite monopoly\" has come under scrutiny and no longer represents a scholarly consensus. \nWhile there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons.Waldbaum, Jane C.

Bronze remained the primary material there until the conquest by Neo-Assyrian Empire in 671 BC. The explanation of this would seem to lie in the fact that the relics are in most cases the paraphernalia of tombs, the funeral vessels and vases, and iron being considered an impure metal by the ancient Egyptians it was never used in their manufacture of these or for any religious purposes. It was attributed to Seth, the spirit of evil who according to Egyptian tradition governed the central deserts of Africa.\nIn the Black Pyramid of Abusir, dating before 2000 BC, Gaston Maspero found some pieces of iron. In the funeral text of Pepi I, the metal is mentioned. A sword bearing the name of pharaoh Merneptah as well as a battle axe with an iron blade and gold-decorated bronze shaft were both found in the excavation of Ugarit.Richard Cowen, 'The Age of Iron Chapter 5 in a series of essays on Geology, History, and People prepares for a course of the University of California at Davis. [http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH5.html Online version] A dagger with an iron blade found in Tutankhamun's tomb, 13th century BC, was recently examined and found to be of meteoric origin.\nFree full text available.\n\nEurope\n\nIn Europe, the use of iron covers the last years of the prehistoric period and the early years of the historic period. The regional Iron Age may be defined as including the last stages of the prehistoric period and the first of the proto-historic periods.The Junior Encyclopædia Britannica: A reference library of general knowledge. (1897). Chicago: E.G. Melvin. Iron working was introduced to Europe in the late 11th century BC,Riederer, Josef; Wartke, Ralf-B.: \"Iron\", Cancik, Hubert; Schneider, Helmuth (eds.): Brill's New Pauly, Brill 2009 probably from the Caucasus, and slowly spread northwards and westwards over the succeeding 500 years. The widespread use of the technology of iron was implemented in Europe simultaneously with Asia.John Collis, \"The European Iron Age\" (1989)\n\nMuseu da Cultura Castreja (14926282396).jpg|Archaeological artifact from the work developed in the area of Citânia de Briteiros\n23.4.14 Briteiros 109 (14012600704).jpg|Cross or cruzado in Citânia de Briteiros\n23.4.14 Briteiros 055 (13988507706).jpg|Informative plaque of the proto-historic settlement of Citânia de Briteiros\nMuseu da Cultura Castreja (14762739747).jpg|Another artifact from Citânia de Briteiros\nPedra Formosa Briteiros.jpg|A pedra formosa\n\nThe Iron Age in Europe is characterized by an elaboration of designs in weapons, implements, and utensils. These are no longer cast but hammered into shape, and decoration is elaborate curvilinear rather than simple rectilinear; the forms and character of the ornamentation of the northern European weapons resembles in some respects Roman arms, while in other respects they are peculiar and evidently representative of northern art.\n\nCentral Asia\n\nThe Iron Age in Central Asia began when iron objects appear among the Indo-European Saka in present-day Xinjiang between the 10th century BC and the 7th century BC, such as those found at the cemetery site of Chawuhukou.Mark E. Hall, \"Towards an absolute chronology for the Iron Age of Inner Asia,\" Antiquity 71.274 [1997], 863-74.\n\nThe Pazyryk culture is an Iron Age archaeological culture (ca. 6th to 3rd centuries BC) identified by excavated artifacts and mummified humans found in the Siberian permafrost in the Altay Mountains.\n\nSouth Asia\n\nImageSize = width:1000 height:125\nPlotArea = width:900 height:80 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:-1200 till:-200\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-1200\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-1200\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  bar:India color:era\n  from: -1200  till: -200 text:Iron Age India\n  bar:Period color:era\n  from: -1200  till: -300 text:Janapadas\n  bar:Period color:era\n  from: -700  till: -300 text:Maha Janapadas\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -1200  till: -832 text:Brihadhrata Dynasty\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -832  till: -667 text:Pradyota Dynasty\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -667  till: -413 text:Haryanka Dynasty\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -413  till: -345 shift:(-30,-5) text:Shishunaga Dynasty\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -345  till: -321 shift:(0,4) text:Nanda Dynasty\n  bar:Dynasty color:era\n  from: -321 till: -200 shift:(20,-5)text:Maurya Dynasty\n\n::Dates are approximate, consult particular article for details\n::  Prehistoric (or Proto-historic) Iron Age  Historic Iron Age\n\nIndian subcontinent\n\nThe history of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent began during the 2nd millennium BC. Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period 1800–1200 BC. Archaeological excavations in Hyderabad show an Iron Age burial site. Rakesh TewariDirector of Archaeology, (Uttar Pradesh) believes that around the beginning of the Indian Iron Age (13th century BC), iron smelting was widely practiced in India. Such use suggests that the date of the technology's inception may be around the 16th century BC.\n\nThe beginning of the 1st millennium BC saw extensive developments in iron metallurgy in India. Technological advancement and mastery of iron metallurgy was achieved during this period of peaceful settlements. One iron working centre in east India has been dated to the first millennium BC.Early Antiquity By I. M. Drakonoff. Published 1991. University of Chicago Press. . pg 372 In Southern India (present day Mysore) iron appeared as early as 12th to 11th centuries BC; these developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country. The Indian Upanishads mention metallurgy.Upanisads By Patrick Olivelle. Published 1998. Oxford University Press. . pg xxix and the Indian Mauryan period saw advances in metallurgy.The New Cambridge History of India By J. F. Richards, Gordon Johnson, Christopher Alan Bayly. Published 2005. Cambridge University Press. . pg 64 As early as 300 BC, certainly by AD 200, high quality steel was produced in southern India, by what would later be called the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon.Juleff, G. (1996), [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v379/n6560/abs/379060a0.html;jsessionid=C12F168C7DE98DE4F8C7337D1C20E6F4 \"An ancient wind powered iron smelting technology in Sri Lanka\"], Nature, 379 (3): 60–63.\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThe protohistoric Early Iron Age in Sri Lanka lasted from 1000 BC to 600 BC. however evidence of Iron usage was found in Excavation of a Protohistoric Canoe burial Site in Haldummulla and has been dated to 2400 BCE.

Allchin 1989. City and State Formation in Early Historic South Asia. South Asian Studies 5:1-16: 3 The skeletal remains of an Early Iron Age chief were excavated in Anaikoddai, Jaffna. The name 'Ko Veta' is engraved in Brahmi script on a seal buried with the skeleton and is assigned by the excavators to the 3rd century BC. Ko, meaning \"King\" in Tamil, is comparable to such names as Ko Atan and Ko Putivira occurring in contemporary Brahmi inscriptions in south India.Indrapala, K. The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, pp. 324 It is also speculated that Early Iron Age sites may exist in Kandarodai, Matota, Pilapitiya and Tissamaharama.Deraniyagala, Siran, The Prehistory of Sri Lanka; an ecological perspective.

The development of iron metallurgy was known by the 9th century BC.Derevianki, A. P. 1973. Rannyi zheleznyi vek PriamuriaDavid N. Keightley. The Origins of Chinese Civilization. Page 226. The large seal script is identified with a group of characters from a book entitled Shĭ Zhoù Piān ( 800 BC). Iron metallurgy reached the Yangzi Valley toward the end of the 6th century BC.Higham, Charles. 1996. The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia The few objects were found at Changsha and Nanjing. The mortuary evidence suggests that the initial use of iron in Lingnan belongs to the mid-to-late Warring States period (from about 350 BC). Important non-precious husi style metal finds include Iron tools found at the tomb at Guwei-cun of the 4th century BC.Encyclopedia of World Art: Landscape in art to Micronesian cultures. McGraw-Hill. 1964.\n\nThe techniques used in Lingnan are a combination of bivalve moulds of distinct southern tradition and the incorporation of piece mould technology from the Zhongyuan. The products of the combination of these two periods are bells, vessels, weapons and ornaments and the sophisticated cast.\n\nAn Iron Age culture of the Tibetan Plateau has tentatively been associated with the Zhang Zhung culture described in early Tibetan writings.\n\nIn Japan, iron items, such as tools, weapons, and decorative objects, are postulated to have entered Japan during the late Yayoi period ( 300 BC–AD 300)[http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/preh.html Prehistoric Archaeological Periods in Japan], Charles T. Keally or the succeeding Kofun period ( AD 250–538), most likely through contacts with the Korean Peninsula and China.\n\nDistinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new pottery styles and the start of intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields. Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Kyūshū to northern Honshū. The Kofun and the subsequent Asuka periods are sometimes referred to collectively as the Yamato period; The word kofun is Japanese for the type of burial mounds dating from that era.\n\nIron objects were introduced to the Korean peninsula through trade with chiefdoms and state-level societies in the Yellow Sea area in the 4th century BC, just at the end of the Warring States Period but before the Western Han Dynasty began.Kim, Do-heon. 2002. Samhan Sigi Jujocheolbu-eui Yutong Yangsang-e Daehan Geomto [A Study of the Distribution Patterns of Cast Iron Axes in the Samhan Period]. Yongnam Kogohak [Yongnam Archaeological Review] 31:1–29.Taylor, Sarah. 1989. The Introduction and Development of Iron Production in Korea. World Archaeology 20(3):422–431. Yoon proposes that iron was first introduced to chiefdoms located along North Korean river valleys that flow into the Yellow Sea such as the Cheongcheon and Taedong Rivers.Yoon, Dong-suk. 1989. Early Iron Metallurgy in Korea. Archaeological Review from Cambridge 8(1):92–99. Iron production quickly followed in the 2nd century BC, and iron implements came to be used by farmers by the 1st century in southern Korea. The earliest known cast-iron axes in southern Korea are found in the Geum River basin. The time that iron production begins is the same time that complex chiefdoms of Proto-historic Korea emerged. The complex chiefdoms were the precursors of early states such as Silla, Baekje, Goguryeo, and GayaBarnes, Gina L. 2001. State Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives.

Sa Huynh beads were made from glass, carnelian, agate, olivine, zircon, gold and garnet; most of these materials were not local to the region, and were most likely imported. Han-Dynasty-style bronze mirrors were also found in Sa Huynh sites. Conversely, Sa Huynh produced ear ornaments have been found in archaeological sites in Central Thailand, Taiwan (Orchid Island).Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., \n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, where there was no continent-wide universal Bronze Age, the use of iron succeeded immediately the use of stone. \nMetallurgy was characterized by the absence of a Bronze Age, and the transition from \"stone to steel\" in tool substances. Early evidence for iron technology in Sub-Saharan Africa can be found at sites such as KM2 and KM3 in northwest Tanzania. Nubia was one of the relatively few places in Africa to have a sustained Bronze Age along with Egypt and much of the rest of North Africa.\n\nVery early copper and bronze working sites in Niger may date to as early as 1500 BC. There is also evidence of iron metallurgy in Termit, Niger from around this period.[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID\n3432&URL_DODO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION\n201.html Iron in Africa: Revising the History, UNESCO] Aux origines de la métallurgie du fer en Afrique, Une ancienneté méconnue: Afrique de l'Ouest et Afrique centrale. \nNubia was a major manufacturer and exporter of iron after the expulsion of the Nubian dynasty from Egypt by the Assyrians in the 7th century BC.Collins, Rober O. and Burns, James M.
