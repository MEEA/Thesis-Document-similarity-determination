  "textBody" : "The First Epistle to the Corinthians (), usually referred to simply as First Corinthians and often written 1 Corinthians, is one of the Pauline epistles of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle says that Paul the Apostle and \"Sosthenes our brother\" wrote it to \"the church of God which is at Corinth\"  although the scholarly consensus holds that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction.[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/1.htm Meyer's NT Commentary] on 1 Corinthians, accessed 16 March 2017\n\nCalled \"a masterpiece of pastoral theology\",[http://divinity.yale.edu/pauls-first-letter-corinthians-2 \"Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians\", Yale Divinity School] it addresses various issues that had arisen in the Christian community at Corinth.\n\nThis epistle contains some well-known phrases, including: \"all things to all men\" (), \"through a glass, darkly\" (), and \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child\" ().\n\nAuthorship\n\nThere is consensus among historians and Christian theologians that Paul is the author of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (c. AD 53–54).Robert Wall, New Interpreter's Bible Vol. X (Abingdon Press, 2002), p. 373 The letter is quoted or mentioned by the earliest of sources, and is included in every ancient canon, including that of Marcion. The personal and even embarrassing texts about immorality in the church increase consensus.\n\nHowever, two passages may have been inserted at a later stage. The first passage is 1 Corinthians 11:2–16, dealing with praying and prophesying with head covering. The second passage is 1 Corinthians 14:34–35, whose authenticity has been hotly debated. Part of the reason for doubt is that in some manuscripts, the verses come at the end of the chapter instead of at its present location. Furthermore, Paul is here appealing to the law which is uncharacteristic of him. Lastly, the verses come into conflict with 11:5 where women are described as praying and prophesying. As well, 10:1-22 is sometimes regarded as another letter fragment, interpolation, or inserted midrash because, among other things, this section virtually seems to equate the consumption of idol meat with idolatry, but Paul seems more lenient regarding its consumption in 8:1-13 and 10:23-11:1.Walter Schmithals, Gnosticism in Corinth (Nashville: Abingdon, 1971), 14, 92-95; Lamar Cope, \"First Corinthians 8-10: Continuity or Contradiction?\" Anglican Theological Review: Supplementary Series II. Christ and His Communities (Mar. 1990) 114-23. Such views are rejected by other scholars who give formidable arguments for the unity of 8:1-11:1.Joop F. M. Smit, About the Idol Offerings (Leuven: Peeters, 2000); B. J. Oropeza, \"Laying to Rest the Midrash,\" Biblica 79 (1998) 57-68.\n\nComposition\n\nAbout the year AD 50, towards the end of his second missionary journey, Paul founded the church in Corinth, before moving on to Ephesus, a city on the west coast of today's Turkey, about 180 miles by sea from Corinth. From there he traveled to Caesarea, and Antioch. Paul returned to Ephesus on his third missionary journey and spent approximately three years there (Acts 19:8, 19:10, 20:31). It was while staying in Ephesus that he received disconcerting news of the community in Corinth regarding jealousies, rivalry, and immoral behavior.[http://www.usccb.org/bible/1corinthians/0 \"1 Corinthians - Introduction\", USCCB] It also appears that based on a letter the Corinthians sent Paul (e.g. 7:1), the congregation was  requesting clarification on a number of matters, such as marriage and the consumption of meat previously offered to idols.\n\nBy comparing Acts of the Apostles 18:1–17 and mentions of Ephesus in the Corinthian correspondence, scholars suggest that the letter was written during Paul's stay in Ephesus, which is usually dated as being in the range of AD 53–57.[http://www.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T2324 Corinthians, First Epistle to the], \"The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\", Ed.

Thiselton suggests that it is possible that I Corinthians was written during Paul's first (brief) stay in Ephesus, at the end of his Second Journey, usually dated to early AD 54.Anthony C. Thiselton, The First Epistle to the Corinthians (Eerdmans, 2000), 31. However, it is more likely that it was written during his extended stay in Ephesus, where he refers to sending Timothy to them (Acts 19:22, I Cor. 4:17).\n\nStructure\n\nThe epistle may be divided into seven parts:Outline from [http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1200#P95_28390 NET Bible.org]\n\n# Salutation (1:1–3)\n## Paul addresses the issue regarding challenges to his apostleship and defends the issue by claiming that it was given to him through a revelation from Christ.

In a thanksgiving recitation the writer thanks God for health, a safe journey, deliverance from danger, or good fortune.\n## In this letter, the thanksgiving \"introduces charismata and gnosis, topics to which Paul will return and that he will discuss at greater length later in the letter\".\n# Division in Corinth (1:10–4:21)\n## Facts of division\n## Causes of division\n## Cure for division\n# Immorality in Corinth (5:1–6:20)\n## Discipline an immoral Brother\n## Resolving personal disputes\n## Sexual purity\n# Difficulties in Corinth (7:1–14:40)\n## Marriage\n## Christian liberty\n## Worship\n# Doctrine of Resurrection (15:1–58)\n# Closing (16:1–24)\n## Paul's closing remarks in his letters usually contain his intentions and efforts to improve the community. He would first conclude with his paraenesis and wish them peace by including a prayer request, greet them with his name and his friends with a holy kiss, and offer final grace and benediction:\n::\n\nContent\n\n Some time before 2 Corinthians was written, Paul paid them a second visit (2 Cor. 12: 14; 2 Cor. 13: 1) to check some rising disorder (2 Cor. 2: 1; 2 Cor. 13: 2), and wrote them a letter, now lost (1 Cor. 5: 9). They had also been visited by Apollos (Acts 18: 27), perhaps by Peter (1 Cor. 1: 12), and by some Jewish Christians who brought with them letters of commendation from Jerusalem (1 Cor. 1: 12; 2 Cor. 3: 1; 2 Cor. 5: 16; 2 Cor. 11: 23).\n\nPaul wrote this letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: Apollos (Acts 19:1), a letter from the Corinthians, the \"household of Chloe\", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul (1:11; 16:17). Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you\", 1:10) and expounding Christian doctrine. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter to the church at Corinth (2 Corinthians 2:13; 8:6, 16–18).\n\nIn general, divisions within the church at Corinth seem to be a problem, and Paul makes it a point to mention these conflicts in the beginning. Specifically, pagan roots still hold sway within their community. Paul wants to bring them back to what he sees as correct doctrine, stating that God has given him the opportunity to be a \"skilled master builder\" to lay the foundation and let others build upon it (1 Cor 3:10).\n\nLater, Paul wrote about immorality in Corinth by discussing an immoral brother, how to resolve personal disputes, and sexual purity. Regarding marriage, Paul states that it is better for Christians to remain unmarried, but that if they lacked self-control, it is better to marry than \"burn\" (πυροῦσθαι) which Christians have traditionally thought meant to burn with sinful desires. The Epistle may include marriage as an apostolic practice in 1 Corinthians 9:5, \"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?\" (In the last case, the letter concurs with Matthew 8:14, which mentions Peter having a mother-in-law and thus, by interpolation, a wife.) However, the Greek word for \"wife\" is the same word for \"woman\". The Early Church Fathers including Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine state the Greek word is ambiguous and the women in 1 Corinthians 9:5 were women ministering to the Apostles as women ministered to Christ (cf Matthew 27:55, Luke 8:1–3), and were not wives,[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0406.htm Tertullian, On Monogamy] \"For have we not the power of eating and drinking?\" he does not demonstrate that \"wives\" were led about by the apostles, whom even such as have not still have the power of eating and drinking; but simply \"women\", who used to minister to them in the stone way (as they did) when accompanying the Lord.\" and assert they left their \"offices of marriage\" to follow Christ and to preach.[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/30091.htm Jerome, Against Jovinianus, Book I] \"In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage.\"\n\nPaul also argues unmarried people must please God, just as married people must please their spouses. The letter is also notable for mentioning the role of women in churches, that for instance they must remain silent (1 Cor. 14:34–35), and yet they have a role of prophecy and apparently speaking tongues in churches (11:2–16). If 14:34-35 is not an interpolation, certain scholars resolve the tension between these texts by positing that wives were either contesting their husband's inspired speeches at church, or the wives/women were chatting and asking questions in a disorderly manner when others were giving inspired utterances. Their silence was unique to the particular situation in the Corinthian gatherings at that time, and on this reading, Paul did not intend his words to be universalized for all women of all churches of all eras. B. J. Oropeza, 1 Corinthians. New Covenant Commentary (Eugene: Cascade, 2017), 187-94; Philip B. Payne, Man and Woman: One in Christ (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2009); Ben Witherington, Women in the Earliest Churches (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988);  After discussing his views on worshipping idols, Paul finally ends with his views on resurrection. He states that Christ died for our sins, and was buried, and rose on the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul then asks: \"Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\" (1 Cor. 15:12) and addresses the question of resurrection.\n\nThroughout the letter, Paul presents issues that are troubling the community in Corinth and offers ways to fix them. Paul states that this letter is to \"admonish\" them as beloved children. They are expected to become imitators of Jesus and follow the ways in Christ as he, Paul, teaches in all his churches (1 Cor. 4:14–16).",
