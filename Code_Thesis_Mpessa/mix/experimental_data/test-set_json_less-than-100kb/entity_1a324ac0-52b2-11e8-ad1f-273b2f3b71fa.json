  "textBody" : "The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC; in French: Commission électrotechnique internationale) is an international standards organization that prepares and publishes International Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies – collectively known as \"electrotechnology\". IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, solar energy, nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others. The IEC also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its International Standards.\n\nThe IEC charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunication and medical technology, as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility (by its Advisory Committee on Electromagnetic Compatibility, ACEC), measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first  International Electrical Congress took place in 1881 at the  International Exposition of Electricity, held in Paris. At that time the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units was agreed to. \n\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission held its inaugural meeting on 26 June 1906, following discussions among the British Institution of Electrical Engineers, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and others, which began at the 1900 Paris International Electrical Congress, and continued with Colonel R. E. B. Crompton playing a key role. In 1906, Lord Kelvin was elected as the first President of the International Electrotechnical Commission  The Life of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs by Silvanus Phillips Thompson, CUP 2011, , 9781108027182. \n\nThe IEC was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement, particularly the gauss, hertz, and weber.  It also first proposed a system of standards, the Giorgi System, which ultimately became the SI, or Système International d’unités (in English, the International System of Units).\n\nIn 1938, it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical, electronic and related technologies. This effort continues, and the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (the on-line version of which is known as the Electropedia) remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries.\n\nThe CISPR (Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques) – in English, the International Special Committee on Radio Interference – is one of the groups founded by the IEC.\n\nCurrently, 82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the Affiliate Country Programme, which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the IEC. Originally located in London, the commission moved to its current headquarters in Geneva in 1948.\n\nIt has regional centres in Asia-Pacific (Singapore), Latin America (São Paulo, Brazil) and North America (Boston, United States).\n\nToday, the IEC is the world's leading international organization in its field, and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members. The work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry, government, academia, test labs and others with an interest in the subject.\n\nIEC standards\n\nIEC standards have numbers in the range 60000–79999 and their titles take a form such as IEC 60417: Graphical symbols for use on equipment. Following the Dresden Agreement with CENELEC the numbers of older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027. Standards of the 60000 series are also found preceded by EN to indicate that the IEC standard is also adopted by CENELEC as a European standard; for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034.\n\nThe IEC cooperates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, it works with several major standards development organizations, including the IEEE with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002, which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work.\n\nStandards developed jointly with ISO such as ISO/IEC 26300 (Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0), ISO/IEC 27001 (Information technology, Security techniques, Information security management systems, Requirements), and CASCO ISO/IEC 17000 series, carry the acronym of both organizations. The use of the ISO/IEC prefix covers publications from ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 - Information Technology, as well as conformity assessment standards developed by ISO CASCO and IEC CAB (Conformity Assessment Board). Other standards developed in cooperation between IEC and ISO are assigned numbers in the 80000 series, such as IEC 82045-1.\n\nIEC standards are also being adopted by other certifying bodies such as BSI (United Kingdom), CSA (Canada), UL & ANSI/INCITS (United States), SABS (South Africa), SAI (Australia), SPC/GB (China) and DIN (Germany). IEC standards adopted by other certifying bodies may have some noted differences from the original IEC standard.[http://webstore.iec.ch IEC Webstore | Welcome]. Webstore.iec.ch.\n\nMembership and participation\n\nThe IEC is made up of members, called national committees, and each NC represents its nation's electrotechnical interests in the IEC. This includes manufacturers, providers, distributors and vendors, consumers and users, all levels of governmental agencies, professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies. National committees are constituted in different ways. Some NCs are public sector only, some are a combination of public and private sector, and some are private sector only. About 90% of those who prepare IEC standards work in industry.\n\nIEC Member countries include:[http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:5:0 IEC full and associate members]\n\nFull members\n\n* Algeria\n* Argentina – Instituto Argentino de Normalización y Certificación (IRAM)\n* Australia – Standards Australia\n* Austria – Österreichischer Verband für Elektrotechnik (ÖVE)\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Brazil – Comitê Brasileiro de Eletricidade, Eletrônica, Iluminação e Telecomunicações (Cobei)\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada – Standards Council of Canada\n* Colombia\n* Chile\n* China – Standardization Administration of China (SAC)\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Egypt\n* Finland\n* France – AFNOR \n* Germany – Deutsche Kommission Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik im DIN und VDE (DKE)\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n\n* India – Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Ireland\n* Israel\n* Italy – Comitato Elettrotecnico Italiano (CEI)\n* Japan – Japanese Industrial Standards Committee\n* Libya\n* Luxembourg\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n* Netherlands\n* New Zealand\n* Norway\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Portugal \n* Qatar\n* Romania\n* Russia – Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Metrology (Rostekhregulirovaniye)\n\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Serbia\n* Singapore\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* South Korea – Korean Agency for Technology and Standards ([http://www.kats.go.kr KATS])\n* South Africa – South African Bureau of Standards (SABS)\n* Spain – Asociación Española de Normalización y Certificación (AENOR)\n* Sweden – Swedish Electrical Standard (SEK)\n* Switzerland – Swiss Electrotechnical Committee (CES)\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Arab Emirates\n* United Kingdom – British Electrotechnical Committee (BEC), part of the British Standards Institution (BSI)\n* United States – American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ([http://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/iec_programs/overview.aspx?menuid=3 USNC/IEC]); NEMA also helps to develop and promote IEC standards[http://www.nema.org/stds/international/iecnema.cfm \"The IEC and NEMA\"], nema.org, accessed 2009-04-12\n\nAssociate members (limited voting and managerial rights)[http://www.iec.ch/about/profile/ IEC membership levels]\n\n* AlbaniaFormerly participating in the affiliate programme.\n* Bahrain\n* Bosnia & Herzegovina\n* Cuba\n* Cyprus\n* Estonia\n* Georgia\n* Iceland – Icelandic Standards (IST)\n\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* Kenya\n* Latvia\n* Lithuania\n* Republic of Macedonia\n* Malta\n\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Morocco – COMELEC\n* Nigeria\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tunisia\n* Vietnam – Vietnamese National Committee Directorate for Standards and Quality (STAMEQ)\n\nAffiliates \n\nIn 2001 and in response to calls from the WTO to open itself to more developing nations, the IEC launched the Affiliate Country Programme to encourage developing nations to become involved in the Commission's work or to use its International Standards.
