  "textBody" : "In linguistics, conjugation () is the creation of derived forms of a verb from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according to rules of grammar). Conjugation may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, voice, case, and other grammatical categories such as possession, definiteness, politeness, causativity, clusivity, interrogativity, transitivity, valency, polarity, telicity,  volition, mirativity, evidentiality, animacy, associativity,http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/features/associativity.html pluractionality, reciprocity, agreement, polypersonal agreement, incorporation, noun class, noun classifiers, and verb classifiershttps://www.academia.edu/10502997/Verb_Classifiers_-_Misfits_of_Nominal_Classification in some languages. Agglutinative and polysynthetic languages tend to have the most complex conjugations albeit some fusional languages such as Archi can also have extremely complex conjugation.  Typically the principal parts are the root and/or several modifications of it (stems). All the different forms of the same verb constitute a lexeme, and the canonical form of the verb that is conventionally used to represent that lexeme (as seen in dictionary entries) is called a lemma.\n\nThe term conjugation is applied only to the inflection of verbs, and not of other parts of speech (inflection of nouns and adjectives is known as declension). Also it is often restricted to denoting the formation of finite forms of a verb – these may be referred to as conjugated forms, as opposed to non-finite forms, such as the infinitive or gerund, which tend not to be marked for most of the grammatical categories.\n\nConjugation is also the traditional name for a group of verbs that share a similar conjugation pattern in a particular language (a verb class). For example, Latin is said to have four conjugations of verbs. This means that any regular Latin verb can be conjugated in any person, number, tense, mood, and voice by knowing which of the four conjugation groups it belongs to, and its principal parts. A verb that does not follow all of the standard conjugation patterns of the language is said to be an irregular verb. The system of all conjugated variants of a particular verb or class of verbs is called a verb paradigm; this may be presented in the form of a conjugation table.\n\nExamples\n\nIndo-European languages usually inflect verbs for several grammatical categories in complex paradigms, although some, like English, have simplified verb conjugation to a large extent. Below is the conjugation of the verb to be in the present tense (of the infinitive, if it exists, and indicative moods), in English, German, Yiddish, Dutch, Afrikaans, Icelandic, Faroese, Swedish, Norwegian, Latvian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, Polish, Slovenian, Macedonian, Urdu or Hindi, Persian, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Albanian, Armenian, Irish, Ukrainian, Ancient Attic Greek and Modern Greek. This is usually the most irregular verb. The similarities in corresponding verb forms may be noticed. Some of the conjugations may be disused, like the English thou-form, or have additional meanings, like the English you-form, which can also stand for second person singular or be impersonal.\n\n1 Archaic, poetical; used only with the pronoun 'thou'.\n2 In Flemish dialects.\n3 In the bokmål written standard.\n4 In the nynorsk written standard. vera and vere are both alternate forms.\n5 Attic.\n6 'eínai' is only used as a noun (\"being, existence\").\n7 Ptc: qenë.\n8 In the Tosk and Geg dialects, respectively.\n9 Existential: هست (hæst) has another meaning. Usage of (æ) is considered to be rural, now. See, Indo-European copula\n\nVerbal agreement\n\nVerbal agreement or concord is a morpho-syntactic construct in which properties of the subject and/or objects of a verb are indicated by the verb form.  Verbs are then said to agree with their subjects (resp. objects).\n\nMany English verbs exhibit subject agreement of the following sort: whereas I go, you go, we go, they go are all grammatical in standard English, she go is not (except in the subjunctive, as \"They requested that she go with them\").  Instead, a special form of the verb to go has to be used to produce she goes.  On the other hand I goes, you goes etc. are not grammatical in standard English.  (Things are different in some English dialects that lack agreement.)  A few English verbs have no special forms that indicate subject agreement (I may, you may, she may), and the verb to be has an additional form am that can only be used with the pronoun I as the subject.\n\nVerbs in written French exhibit more intensive agreement morphology than English verbs: je suis (I am), tu es (\"you are\", singular informal), elle est (she is), nous sommes (we are), vous êtes (\"you are\", plural), ils sont (they are).  Historically, English used to have a similar verbal paradigm. Some historic verb forms are used by Shakespeare as slightly archaic or more formal variants (I do, thou dost, she doth, typically used by nobility) of the modern forms.\n\nSome languages with verbal agreement can leave certain subjects implicit when the subject is fully determined by the verb form. In Spanish, for instance, subject pronouns do not need to be explicitly present, even though in French, its close relative, they are obligatory. The Spanish equivalent to the French je suis (I am) can be simply soy (lit. \"am\").  The pronoun yo (I) in the explicit form yo soy is only required for emphasis or to clear ambiguity in complex texts.\n\nSome languages have a richer agreement system in which verbs also agree with some or all of their objects. Ubykh exhibits verbal agreement for the subject, direct object, indirect object, benefaction and ablative objects (a.w3.s.xe.n.t'u.n, you gave it to him for me).\n\nBasque can show agreement not only for subject, direct object and indirect object, but it also on occasion exhibits agreement for the listener as the implicit benefactor: autoa ekarri digute means \"they brought us the car\" (neuter agreement for listener), but autoa ekarri ziguten means \"they brought us the car\" (agreement for feminine singular listener).\n\nLanguages with a rich agreement morphology facilitate relatively free word order without leading to increased ambiguity. The canonical word order in Basque is subject–object–verb. However, all permutations of subject, verb and object are permitted.\n\nNonverbal person agreement\n\nIn some languages,Stassen, Leon; Intransitive Predication (Oxford Studies in Typology and Linguistic Theory); published 1997 by Oxford University Press; p. 39.  predicative adjectives and copular complements receive a form of person agreement that is distinct from that used on ordinary predicative verbs. Although this is a form of conjugation in that it refers back to the person of the subject, it is not “verbal” because it always derives from pronouns that have become cliticised to the nouns to which they refer.Stassen; Intransitive Predication; pp. 77 & 284-288 An example of nonverbal person agreement, along with contrasting verbal conjugation, can be found from BejaStassen, Intransitive Predication; p. 40 (person agreement affixes in bold):\n\n* wun.tu.wi, “you (fem.) are big”\n* hadá.b.wa, “you (masc.) are a sheik”\n* e.n.fór, “he flees”\n\nAnother example can be found from Ket:\n\n* fèmba.di, “I am a Tungus”\n* dɨ.fen, “I am standing”\n\nIn Turkic, and a few Uralic and Australian Aboriginal languages, predicative adjectives and copular complements take affixes that are identical to those used on predicative verbs, but their negation is different. For example, in Turkish:\n\n* koş.u.yor.sun “you are running”\n* çavuş.sun “you are a sergeant”\n\nUnder negation this becomes (negative affixes in bold):\n\n* koş.mu.yor.sun “you are not running”\n* çavuş değil.sin “you are not a sergeant”\n\nFor this reason, the person agreement affixes used with predicative adjectives and nominals in Turkic languages are considered to be nonverbal in character. In some analyses, they are viewed as a form of verbal takeover by a copular strategy.\n\nFactors that affect conjugation\n\nCommon grammatical categories according to which verbs can be conjugated are the following:\n*Finite verb forms:\n**Grammatical person\n**Grammatical number\n**Grammatical gender\n**Grammatical tense\n**Grammatical aspect\n**Grammatical mood\n**Grammatical voice\n*Non-finite verb forms.\n\nOther factors which may affect conjugation are:\n* Degree of formality (see T-V distinction, Honorific speech in Japanese, Korean speech levels)\n*Inclusiveness and exclusiveness in the 1st. person plural\n*Transitivity\n*Valency",
