  "textBody" : "The Council of 1123 is reckoned in the series of Ecumenical councils by the Catholic Church. It was convoked by Pope Callixtus II in December, 1122, immediately after the Concordat of Worms. The Council sought to: (a) bring an end to the practice of the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices by people who were laymen; (b) free the election of bishops and abbots from secular influence; (c) clarify the separation of spiritual and temporal affairs; (d) re-establish the principle that spiritual authority resides solely in the Church; (e) abolish the claim of the emperors to influence papal elections.\n\nThe council convoked by Callistus II was significant in size: three hundred bishops and more than six hundred abbots assembled at Rome in March, 1123; Callistus presided in person. During the Council the decisions of the Concordat of Worms were read and ratified. Various other decisions were promulgated.\n\nHistory leading to the Council\n\nThe First Lateran Council was called by Pope Callistus II whose reign began  February 1, 1119.  It demarcated the end of the Investiture controversy which had begun before the time of Pope Gregory VII.  The issues had been contentious and had continued with unabated bitterness for almost a century.   Guido, as he was called before his elevation to the papacy,Hardouin VI, 2, 1916. was the son of William I, Count of Burgundy.  He was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of Europe on both sides of his family.  He had been named the papal legate to France by Pope Paschal II.  During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II yielded to the military threats of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, and was induced to issue the Privilegium in the year 1111.  By this document the Church gave up much of what had been claimed and subsequently attained by Pope Gregory VII and his Gregorian Reforms.\n\nThese concessions did not bring the expected peace but were received with violent reactionary opposition everywhere.  Europe had come to expect an end to the Investiture controversy, and was not willing to return to the old days when the Holy Roman Emperor named the pope.  The greatest resistance was seen in France and was led by Guido, who still held the office of the papal legate.    He had been present in the Lateran Synod of 1112 which had proclaimed the Privilegium of 1111.  On his return to France, Guido convoked an assembly of the French and Burgundian bishops at Vienne (1112).  There the lay investiture of the clergy (the practice of the king, especially the Holy Roman Emperor naming bishops and the pope) was denounced as heretical.   A sentence of excommunication was  pronounced against Henry V, who had extorted through violence from the pope the concessions documented in the Privilegium.  The agreement was deemed to be opposed to the interests of the Church.   The decrees from the assembly of Vienne which denounced the Privilegium were sent to Paschal II with a request for confirmation. Pope Paschal II confirmed these which were received in general terms, on  October 20, 1112.\n\nGuido was later created cardinal by Pope Paschal II.Synod of Vienne, see MANSI, XXI, 175Synod of Vienne:  HARDOUIN, VI, 2, 1752Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187Synod of Reims:  HEFELE, Conciliengesch., V, 344Synod of Reims:  HALLER, Die Verhandlungen zu Mouzon (1119)   The latter did not seem to have been pleased with Guido’s  bold and forward attacks upon Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor.  On the death of Paschal II, January 21, 1118, Gelasius II was elected pope.  He was immediately seized by the Italian allies of Henry V, and on his liberation by the populace fled to Gaeta, where he was crowned.   Henry V demanded the confirmation of the \"Privilegium\" and  received no satisfactory reply. He then set about naming Burdinus, the archbishop of Braga, as his own pope.  This pope assumed the name Gregory VIII, but came to be known as antipope Gregory VIII.  Burdinus had already been deposed and excommunicated because he had crowned Henry V and the Holy Roman Emperor in Rome in 1117.\n\nThe excommunication of Bardinus was reiterated in Canon 6 of the document produced by Lateran I.  Gelasius II promptly excommunicated the antipope Gregory VIII and Henry V.  Gelasius was forced to flee under duress from the army of Henry V, and took refuge in the monastery of Cluny, where he died in January 1119.  On the fourth day after the death of Gelasius II, February I, 1119,  owing mainly to the exertions of Cardinal Cuno, Guido was elected pope and assumed the title of Callistus II. He was crowned  Pope at Vienne on February 9, 1119.\n\nBecause of his close connection with the great royal families of Germany, France, England and Denmark, Callistus' papacy was received with much anticipation and  celebration throughout Europe.  There was a real hope throughout the Continent that the Investiture controversy might be settled once and for all.   In the interest of conciliation, even the papal embassy was received by  Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor at Strasburg.  However, it soon became clear that Henry was not willing to concede his presumed and ancient right to name the pope and bishops within his kingdom.  Perhaps to demonstrate conciliation or because of political necessity,  Henry withdrew his support for antipope Gregory VIII.\n\nIt was agreed that Henry and Pope Callistus would meet at Mousson.   On June 8, 1119, Callistus held a synod at Toulouse to proclaim the disciplinary reforms he had worked to attain in the French Church.   In October, 1119, he opened the council at Reims. Louis VI of France and most of the barons of France attended this council along with more than four hundred bishops and abbots. The Pope was also to meet with Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor at Mousson.  However, Henry showed up with an army of thirty thousand men.  Callistus left Reims for Mousson, but upon learning of the warlike stance of Henry, quickly retreated back to Reims.  Here, the Church dealt with issues of simony, concubinage of the clergy.\n\nIt was clear by now that Henry was in no mood to reconcile and a compromise with him was not to be had.  The Conclave at Reims considered the situation and determined, as an entire Church, to formally excommunicate both Henry V and the antipope Gregory VIII.  This occurred on October 30, 1119.  While at Reims, Callistus tried to effect a settlement with Henry I of England and his brother Robert.  This too, met with failure.\n\nCallistus was determined to enter Rome which was occupied by the German forces and the antipope Gregory VIII.   There was an uprising by the population which forced Gregory VIII to flee the city.  After much political and military intrigue in Rome and the southern Italian states, Gregory VIII was formally deposed and Callistus II was generally  recognized as the legitimate Pope in 1121.  Having become the established power in Italy, Callistus now returned the conflict with Henry V over the issue of lay investiture.  Henry had been the recipient of great pressure from many of his barons in Germany over his conflict with the pope.  Some had entered into open rebellion.  Henry was forced by circumstances to seek a peace with Callistus.  Initial negotiations were conducted in October, 1121, at Wurzburg.  Lambert, the Cardinal of Ostia was dispatched to convoke a synod at Worms, which began on September 8, 1122.    By September 23, the Concordat of Worms, also called the Pactum Calixtinum was concluded.  On his side, the emperor gave up his claim to investiture with ring and crosier and granted freedom of election to the episcopal sees.\n\nThe elections of bishops could be witnessed by the emperor or his representatives.  Callistus obtained the right to name bishops throughout Germany, but still did not have this power in much of Burgundy and Italy.Concordat of Worms, see MANSI, XXI, 273, 287Concordat of Worms: JAFFE, Bibl.

Gesch., 1885\n\nThe First Lateran Council was convoked to confirm the Concordat of Worms.  The council was most representative with nearly three hundred bishops and six hundred abbots from every part of Catholic Europe being present.  It convened on March 18, 1123.  Decrees were also passed directed against simony, concubinage among the clergy, church robbers, and forgers of Church documents; the council also reaffirmed indulgences for Crusaders.\n\nIn the remaining few years of his life, Callistus II attempted to secure the status of the Church as it had existed at the end of the reign of Pope Gregory VII.  He reorganized and reformed the churches around Rome, canonized Conrad of Constance, condemned the teaching of Peter de Bruis, confirmed the Bishop Thurston of York against the wishes of Henry I of England, and affirmed the freedom of York from the see of Canterbury.  Callistus died December 13, 1124. He was succeeded by Pope Honorius II.  Callistus II was a strong figure who brought a relative, if tentative peace between Germany and the Church.  The Concordat of Worms and the First Lateran Council changed forever the belief in the divine right of kings to name the pope and bishops, and reshaped the nature of church and state forever.Biographies by Pandulphus Aletrinus, Aragonius and Bernardus Guidonis (Muratori, Script.

Whoever, therefore, shall dare molest or seize these during the absence of their owners, shall incur excommunication. Those, however, who with a view of going to Jerusalem or to Spain (that is, against the Moors) are known to have attached the cross to their garments and afterward removed it, we command in virtue of our Apostolic authority to replace it and begin the journey within a year from the coming Easter. Otherwise we shall excommunicate them and interdict within their territory all divine service except the baptism of infants and the administration of the last rites to the dying.\n\nCANON 12\n\nSummary. The property of the porticani dying without heirs is not to be disposed of in a manner contrary to the wish of the one deceased.\n\nText. With the advice of our brethren and of the entire Curia, as well as with the will and consent of the prefect, we decree the abolition of that evil custom which has hitherto prevailed among the porticani, namely, of disposing, contrary to the wish of the one deceased, of the property of porticani dying without heirs; with this understanding, however, that in future the porticani remain faithful to the Roman Church, to us and to our successors.\n\nCANON 13\n\nSummary. If anyone violates the truce of God and after the third admonition does not make satisfaction, he shall be anathematized.\n\nText.

The alienation of possessions of the exarchate of Ravenna is condemned, and the Ordinaries made by the intruders are invalid.\n\nText. The alienation that has been made especially by Otto, Guido, Jerome, and perhaps by Philip of possessions of the exarchate of Ravenna, we condemn. In a general way we declare invalid the alienations in whatever manner made by bishops and abbots whether intruded or canonically elected, and also the ordinations conferred by them whether with the consent of the clergy of the Church or simoniacally. We also absolutely forbid any cleric in any way to alienate his prebend or any ecclesiastical benefice. If he has presumed to do this in the past or shall presume to do so in the future, his action shall be null and he shall be subject to the canonical penalties .\n\nResults of the Council\n\nLateran I was the first of four Lateran Councils between the years 1123–1215.  The first  was not very original in its concept, nor one called to meet a pressing theological question.  For the most part, Pope Callistus II summoned the council to ratify the various meetings and concords which had been occurring in and around Rome for several years.  The most pressing issue was that of the Investiture controversy which had consumed nearly a century of contention and open warfare.  At the heart of the question was the ancient right of the Holy Roman Emperor to name the pope as well as bishops and priests.  These would be invested with some secular symbol such as a sword or scepter and the spiritual authority represented by a ring, miter and crosier.  To an illiterate population, it appeared the bishop or abbot was now the king’s inferior and owed his position to the king.  This issue came to the fore in the first part of the eleventh century when Rome and the pope sought autonomy from the Holy Roman Emperor.  It had been a central issue in the reign of Pope Gregory VII and his battles with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.Bellitto, Christopher M., pp 49–56  “The General Councils: A History of the Twenty-one Church Councils from Nicaea to Vatican II”, Paulist Press, Mahway, N. J.  2002     The issue was never settled.  Years of teaching by Roman trained priests and bishops in Germany had led to an educated generation which rejected the idea of divine right of kings.     \nThe Third Lateran Council and the Fourth Lateran Council are generally considered to be of much greater significance than Lateran I.  However, Lateran I marked the first time a general and large Council had been held in the West.  All previous Councils had been in the East and dominated by  Greek theologians and philosophers.Latourette, K. S.  P. 475, 484–85 “A History of Christianity”, Eyre and Spottiswoode Ltd. London, 1955\nIn the struggle between Stephen of England and Matilda, the daughter of Henry I of England, the  English Church slipped away from the close control the Normans had exercised.  Stephen was forced to make many concessions to the Church to gain some element of political control.  Historians have largely considered his rule to be a disaster, calling it The Anarchy.Thorndike, L. p. 294 et seq \"The History of Medieval Europe, Third Edition\", Houghton, Mifflin, 1956\n\nBecause of political necessity, the Holy Roman Emperors were restrained from directly naming bishops in the kingdom.  In practicality, the process continued to a certain extent.  The issue of separation of Church and State was simply recast in a different direction.  Of all the Gregorian Reforms which were embodied by Lateran I, celibacy of the clergy was the most successful.  Simony was curtailed. As time progressed, secular interference into the politics of the Church was seen to continue, albeit in different ways from that of the Investiture controversy.\n\nIt has been argued by some historians that the Concordat of Worms and its reiteration by Lateran I were little more than face saving measures by the Church.  Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor continued to name bishops within his kingdom.  His control over the papacy was definitely abated.Dahlmus J. pp. 225–229, \"The Middle Ages, A Popular History\", Doubleday and Co., Garden City, New York, 1968  At the time, the Concordat of Worms was proclaimed as a great victory for Henry V inside the Holy Roman Empire.  It did serve to constrain much of the most recent warfare in and outside the empire.  In the end, Henry V died the monarch of a much diminished kingdom.Gontard, F.  pp. 240–241,   \"The Chair of Peter, A History of the Papacy\", Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1964",

After much political and military intrigue in Rome and the southern Italian states, Gregory VIII was formally deposed and Callistus II was generally  recognized as the legitimate Pope in 1121.  Having become the established power in Italy, Callistus now returned the conflict with Henry V over the issue of lay investiture.  Henry had been the recipient of great pressure from many of his barons in Germany over his conflict with the pope.  Some had entered into open rebellion.  Henry was forced by circumstances to seek a peace with Callistus.  Initial negotiations were conducted in October, 1121, at Wurzburg.  Lambert, the Cardinal of Ostia was dispatched to convoke a synod at Worms, which began on September 8, 1122.    By September 23, the Concordat of Worms, also called the Pactum Calixtinum was concluded.  On his side, the emperor gave up his claim to investiture with ring and crosier and granted freedom of election to the episcopal sees.\n\nThe elections of bishops could be witnessed by the emperor or his representatives.  Callistus obtained the right to name bishops throughout Germany, but still did not have this power in much of Burgundy and Italy.Concordat of Worms, see MANSI, XXI, 273, 287Concordat of Worms: JAFFE, Bibl.

Gesch., 1885\n\nThe First Lateran Council was convoked to confirm the Concordat of Worms.  The council was most representative with nearly three hundred bishops and six hundred abbots from every part of Catholic Europe being present.  It convened on March 18, 1123.  Decrees were also passed directed against simony, concubinage among the clergy, church robbers, and forgers of Church documents; the council also reaffirmed indulgences for Crusaders.\n\nIn the remaining few years of his life, Callistus II attempted to secure the status of the Church as it had existed at the end of the reign of Pope Gregory VII.  He reorganized and reformed the churches around Rome, canonized Conrad of Constance, condemned the teaching of Peter de Bruis, confirmed the Bishop Thurston of York against the wishes of Henry I of England, and affirmed the freedom of York from the see of Canterbury.  Callistus died December 13, 1124. He was succeeded by Pope Honorius II.  Callistus II was a strong figure who brought a relative, if tentative peace between Germany and the Church.  The Concordat of Worms and the First Lateran Council changed forever the belief in the divine right of kings to name the pope and bishops, and reshaped the nature of church and state forever.Biographies by Pandulphus Aletrinus, Aragonius and Bernardus Guidonis (Muratori, Script.

Ordinations and promotions made for pecuniary considerations are devoid of every dignity.\n\nText.

Marriages between blood-relatives are forbidden.\n\nText. We forbid marriages between blood-relatives because they are forbidden by the divine and secular laws.

Whoever, therefore, shall dare molest or seize these during the absence of their owners, shall incur excommunication. Those, however, who with a view of going to Jerusalem or to Spain (that is, against the Moors) are known to have attached the cross to their garments and afterward removed it, we command in virtue of our Apostolic authority to replace it and begin the journey within a year from the coming Easter. Otherwise we shall excommunicate them and interdict within their territory all divine service except the baptism of infants and the administration of the last rites to the dying.\n\nCANON 12\n\nSummary. The property of the porticani dying without heirs is not to be disposed of in a manner contrary to the wish of the one deceased.\n\nText.

If anyone violates the truce of God and after the third admonition does not make satisfaction, he shall be anathematized.\n\nText.

Churches and their possessions, as well as the person and things connected with them, shall remain safe and unmolested.\n\nText.

The alienation of possessions of the exarchate of Ravenna is condemned, and the Ordinaries made by the intruders are invalid.\n\nText. The alienation that has been made especially by Otto, Guido, Jerome, and perhaps by Philip of possessions of the exarchate of Ravenna, we condemn. In a general way we declare invalid the alienations in whatever manner made by bishops and abbots whether intruded or canonically elected, and also the ordinations conferred by them whether with the consent of the clergy of the Church or simoniacally. We also absolutely forbid any cleric in any way to alienate his prebend or any ecclesiastical benefice. If he has presumed to do this in the past or shall presume to do so in the future, his action shall be null and he shall be subject to the canonical penalties .\n\nResults of the Council\n\nLateran I was the first of four Lateran Councils between the years 1123–1215.  The first  was not very original in its concept, nor one called to meet a pressing theological question.  For the most part, Pope Callistus II summoned the council to ratify the various meetings and concords which had been occurring in and around Rome for several years.  The most pressing issue was that of the Investiture controversy which had consumed nearly a century of contention and open warfare.  At the heart of the question was the ancient right of the Holy Roman Emperor to name the pope as well as bishops and priests.  These would be invested with some secular symbol such as a sword or scepter and the spiritual authority represented by a ring, miter and crosier.  To an illiterate population, it appeared the bishop or abbot was now the king’s inferior and owed his position to the king.  This issue came to the fore in the first part of the eleventh century when Rome and the pope sought autonomy from the Holy Roman Emperor.  It had been a central issue in the reign of Pope Gregory VII and his battles with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.Bellitto, Christopher M., pp 49–56  “The General Councils: A History of the Twenty-one Church Councils from Nicaea to Vatican II”, Paulist Press, Mahway, N. J.  2002     The issue was never settled.  Years of teaching by Roman trained priests and bishops in Germany had led to an educated generation which rejected the idea of divine right of kings.     \nThe Third Lateran Council and the Fourth Lateran Council are generally considered to be of much greater significance than Lateran I.  However, Lateran I marked the first time a general and large Council had been held in the West.  All previous Councils had been in the East and dominated by  Greek theologians and philosophers.Latourette, K. S.  P. 475, 484–85 “A History of Christianity”, Eyre and Spottiswoode Ltd. London, 1955\nIn the struggle between Stephen of England and Matilda, the daughter of Henry I of England, the  English Church slipped away from the close control the Normans had exercised.  Stephen was forced to make many concessions to the Church to gain some element of political control.  Historians have largely considered his rule to be a disaster, calling it The Anarchy.Thorndike, L. p. 294 et seq \"The History of Medieval Europe, Third Edition\", Houghton, Mifflin, 1956\n\nBecause of political necessity, the Holy Roman Emperors were restrained from directly naming bishops in the kingdom.  In practicality, the process continued to a certain extent.  The issue of separation of Church and State was simply recast in a different direction.  Of all the Gregorian Reforms which were embodied by Lateran I, celibacy of the clergy was the most successful.  Simony was curtailed. As time progressed, secular interference into the politics of the Church was seen to continue, albeit in different ways from that of the Investiture controversy.\n\nIt has been argued by some historians that the Concordat of Worms and its reiteration by Lateran I were little more than face saving measures by the Church.  Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor continued to name bishops within his kingdom.  His control over the papacy was definitely abated.Dahlmus J. pp. 225–229, \"The Middle Ages, A Popular History\", Doubleday and Co., Garden City, New York, 1968  At the time, the Concordat of Worms was proclaimed as a great victory for Henry V inside the Holy Roman Empire.  It did serve to constrain much of the most recent warfare in and outside the empire.  In the end, Henry V died the monarch of a much diminished kingdom.Gontard, F.  pp. 240–241,   \"The Chair of Peter, A History of the Papacy\", Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1964.
