  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements.  As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules.  The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers mod  when  is a prime number.\n\nFinite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory.\n\nDefinitions, first examples, and basic properties \n\nThe number of elements of a finite field is called its order.  A finite field of order  exists if and only if the order  is a prime power  (where  is a prime number and  is a positive integer).  All finite fields of a given order are isomorphic.  In a field of order , adding  copies of any element always results in zero; that is, the characteristic of the field is . \n\nIn a finite field of order , the polynomial  has all  elements of the finite field as roots. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a multiplicative group. This group is cyclic, so all non-zero elements can be expressed as powers of a single element called a primitive element of the field (in general there will be several primitive elements for a given field.)\n\nA finite field is a finite set on which the four operations multiplication, addition, subtraction and division (excluding division by zero) are defined, satisfying the rules of arithmetic known as the field axioms.  The simplest examples of finite fields are the fields of prime order: for each prime number , the field  (also denoted , \\mathbb{F}_{p}, or ) of order (that is, size)  may be constructed as the integers modulo . A more general algebraic structure that satisfies all the other axioms of a field, but whose multiplication is not required to be commutative, is called a division ring (or sometimes skewfield), however by Wedderburn's little theorem, any finite division ring must be commutative, and hence a finite field.\n\nThe elements of such a field may be represented by integers in the range . The sum, the difference and the product are computed by taking the remainder by  of the integer result. The multiplicative inverse of an element may be computed by using the extended Euclidean algorithm (see ).\n\nLet  be a finite field. For any element  in  and any integer , let us denote by  the sum of  copies of . The least positive  such that  must exist and is a prime number; it is called the characteristic of the field.\n\nIf the characteristic of  is , one can define multiplication of an element  of  by an element  of  (k,x)\\mapsto k\\cdot x by choosing an integer representative for  and using repeated addition.  This multiplication makes  into a -vector space. It follows that the number of elements of  is  for some integer .\n\nFor every prime number  and every positive integer , there exist finite fields of order , and all fields of this order are isomorphic (see  below). One may therefore identify all fields of order , which are therefore unambiguously denoted \\mathbb{F}_{p^n},  or , where the letters GF stand for \"Galois field\".This notation was introduced by E. H. Moore in an address given in 1893 at the International Mathematical Congress held in Chicago .\n\nThe identity\n(x+y)^p\nx^p+y^p\n(sometimes called the freshman's dream) is true (for every  and ) in a field of characteristic . (This follows from each binomial coefficient of the expansion of , except the first and the last, being a multiple of ).\n\nFor each element  in the field  for a prime number , one has  (This is an immediate consequence of Fermat's little theorem, and this may be proved as follows: the equality is trivially true for  and ; one obtains the result for the other elements of  by applying the above identity to  and , where   successively takes the values  modulo .) This implies the equality\nX^p-X=\\prod_{a\\in {\\rm GF}(p)} (X-a)\nfor polynomials over .  More generally, every element in  satisfies the polynomial equation  .\n\nAny finite field extension of a finite field is separable and simple.  That is, if  is a finite field and  is a subfield of , then  is obtained from  by adjoining a single element whose minimal polynomial is separable. To use a jargon, finite fields are perfect.\n\nExistence and uniqueness\n\nLet  be a prime power, and  be the splitting field of the polynomial \nP=X^q-X\nover the prime field . This means that  is a finite field of lowest order, in which  has  distinct roots (the roots are distinct, as the formal derivative of  is equal to ). The above identity shows that the sum and the product of two roots of  are roots of , as well as the multiplicative inverse of a root of . In other word, the roots of  form a field of order , which is equal to  by the minimality of the splitting field.\n\nThe uniqueness up to isomorphism of splitting fields implies thus that all fields of order  are isomorphic.\n\nIn summary, we have the following classification theorem first proved in 1893 by E. H. Moore:\n\n:The order of a finite field is a prime power. For every prime power  there are fields of order , and they are all isomorphic. In these fields, every element satisfies\n::x^q=x,\n:and the polynomial  factors as \n::X^q-X= \\prod_{a\\in F} (X-a).\n\nIt follows that  contains a subfield isomorphic to  if and only if  is a divisor of ; in that case, this subfield is unique. In fact, the polynomial  divides  if and only if  is a divisor of .\n\nExplicit construction of finite fields \n\nNon-prime fields\n\nGiven a prime power  with  prime and , the field  may be explicitly constructed in the following way. One chooses first an irreducible polynomial  in  of degree  (such an irreducible polynomial always exists). Then the quotient ring \n{\\rm GF}(q) = {\\rm GF}(p)[X]/(P)\nof the polynomial ring  by the ideal generated by  is a field of order .\n\nMore explicitly, the elements of  are the polynomials over  whose degree is strictly less than . The addition and the subtraction are those of polynomials over . The product of two elements is the remainder of the Euclidean division by  of the product in .\nThe multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm; see Extended Euclidean algorithm § Simple algebraic field extensions.\n\nExcept in the construction of , there are several possible choices for , which produce isomorphic results. To simplify the Euclidean division, for  one commonly chooses polynomials of the form \nX^n+aX+b,\nwhich make the needed Euclidean divisions very efficient. However, for some fields, typically in characteristic , irreducible polynomials of the form  may not exist. In characteristic , if the polynomial  is reducible, it is recommended to choose  with the lowest possible  that makes the polynomial irreducible. If all these trinomials are reducible, one chooses \"pentanomials\" , as polynomials of degree greater than , with an even number of terms, are never irreducible in characteristic , having  as a root.\n\nIn the next sections, we will show how this general construction method works for small finite fields.\n\nField with four elements\n\nOver , there is only one irreducible polynomial of degree :\nX^2+X+1\nTherefore, for  the construction of the preceding section must involve this polynomial, and\n{\\rm GF}(4) = {\\rm GF}(2)[X]/(X^2+X+1).\n\nIf one denotes  a root of this polynomial in , the tables of the operations in  are the following. There is no table for subtraction, because subtraction is identical to addition, as is the case for every field of characteristic 2. In the third table, for the division of  by ,  must be read on the left, and  on the top.\n\nfor an odd prime \n\nFor applying the above general construction of finite fields in the case of , one has to find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2. For , this has been done in the preceding section. If  is an odd prime, there are always irreducible polynomials of the form , with  in .\n\nMore precisely, the polynomial  is irreducible over  if and only if  is a quadratic non-residue modulo  (this is almost the definition of a quadratic non-residue). There are \\frac{p-1}{2} quadratic non-residues modulo . For example,  is a quadratic non-residue for , and  is a quadratic non-residue for . If , that is , one may choose  as a quadratic non-residue, which allows us to have a very simple irreducible polynomial .\n\nHaving chosen a quadratic non-residue , let  be a symbolic square root of , that is a symbol which has the property , in the same way as the complex number  is a symbolic square root of . Then, the elements of  are all the linear expressions\na+b\\alpha,\nwith  and  in . The operations on  are defined as follows (the operations between elements of  represented by Latin letters are the operations in ):\n\n\\begin{align}\n-(a+b\\alpha)&=-a+(-b)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)+(c+d\\alpha)&=(a+c)+(b+d)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)(c+d\\alpha)&=(ac + rbd)+ (ad+bc)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)^{-1}&=a(a^2-rb^2)^{-1}+(-b)(a^2-rb^2)^{-1}\\alpha\n\\end{align}\n\nand \n\nThe polynomial\nX^3-X-1\nis irreducible over  and , that is, it is irreducible modulo  and  (to show this it suffices to show that it has no root in  nor in ). It follows that the elements of  and  may be represented by expressions\na+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2,\nwhere  are elements of  or  (respectively), and \\alpha is a symbol such that \n\\alpha^3=\\alpha+1.\n\nThe addition, additive inverse and multiplication on  and  may thus be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of  or , represented by Latin letters, are the operations in  or , respectively:\n\n\\begin{align}\n-(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)&=-a+(-b)\\alpha+(-c)\\alpha^2 \\qquad\\text{(for } \\mathrm{GF}(8), \\text{this operation is the identity)}\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)+(d+e\\alpha+f\\alpha^2)&=(a+d)+(b+e)\\alpha+(c+f)\\alpha^2\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)(d+e\\alpha+f\\alpha^2)&=(ad + bf+ce)+ (ae+bd+bf+ce+cf)\\alpha+(af+be+cd+cf)\\alpha^2\n\\end{align}\n\nThe polynomial\nX^4+X+1\nis irreducible over , that is, it is irreducible modulo . It follows that the elements of  may be represented by expressions\na+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3,\nwhere  are either  or  (elements of ), and  is a symbol such that \n\\alpha^4=\\alpha+1.\n\nAs the characteristic of  is , each element is its additive inverse in .\nThe addition and multiplication on  may be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of , represented by Latin letters are the operations in .\n\n\\begin{align}\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3)+(e+f\\alpha+g\\alpha^2+h\\alpha^3)&=(a+e)+(b+f)\\alpha+(c+g)\\alpha^2+(d+h)\\alpha^3\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3)(e+f\\alpha+g\\alpha^2+h\\alpha^3)&=(ae+bh+cg+df)\n+(af+be+bh+cg+df +ch+dg)\\alpha\\;+\\\\\n&\\quad\\;(ag+bf+ce +ch+dg+dh)\\alpha^2\n+(ah+bg+cf+de +dh)\\alpha^3\n\\end{align}\n\nMultiplicative structure \n\nThe set of non-zero elements in  is an abelian group under the multiplication, of order . By Lagrange's theorem, there exists a divisor  of  such that  for every non-zero  in . As the equation  has at most  solutions in any field,  is the lowest possible value for .\nThe structure theorem of finite abelian groups implies that this multiplicative group is cyclic, that is, all non-zero elements are powers of a single element. In summary:\nThe multiplicative group of the non-zero elements in  is cyclic, and there exist an element , such that the  non-zero elements of  are .\n\nSuch an element  is called a primitive element. Unless , the primitive element is not unique. The number of primitive elements is  where  is Euler's totient function.\n\nThe result above implies that  for every  in . The particular case where  is prime is Fermat's little theorem.\n\nDiscrete logarithm \n\nIf  is a primitive element in , then for any non-zero element  in , there is a unique integer  with  such that\n.\nThis integer  is called the discrete logarithm of  to the base .\n\nWhile  can be computed very quickly, for example using exponentiation by squaring, there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the inverse operation, the discrete logarithm. This has been used in various cryptographic protocols, see Discrete logarithm for details.\n\nWhen the nonzero elements of  are represented by their discrete logarithms, multiplication and division are easy, as they reduce to addition and subtraction modulo . However, addition amounts to computing the discrete logarithm of . The identity \nallows one to solve this problem by constructing the table of the discrete logarithms of , called Zech's logarithms, for  (it is convenient to define the discrete logarithm of zero as being ).\n\nZech's logarithms are useful for large computations, such as linear algebra over medium-sized fields, that is, fields that are sufficiently large for making natural algorithms inefficient, but not too large, as one has to pre-compute a table of the same size as the order of the field.\n\nRoots of unity\n\nEvery nonzero element of a finite field is a root of unity, as  for every nonzero element of .\n\nIf  is a positive integer, an th primitive root of unity is a solution of the equation  that is not a solution of the equation  for any positive integer . If  is a th primitive root of unity in a field , then  contains all the  roots of unity, which are .\n\nThe field  contains a th primitive root of unity if and only if  is a divisor of ; if  is a divisor of , then the number of primitive th roots of unity in  is  (Euler's totient function). The number of th roots of unity in  is .\n\nIn a field of characteristic , every th root of unity is also a th root of unity. It follows that primitive th roots of unity never exist in a field of characteristic .\n\nOn the other hand, if  is coprime to , the roots of the th cyclotomic polynomial are distinct in every field of characteristic , as this polynomial is a divisor of , whose discriminant  is nonzero modulo . It follows that the th cyclotomic polynomial factors over  into distinct irreducible polynomials that have all the same degree, say , and that  is the smallest field of characteristic  that contains the th primitive roots of unity.\n\nExample: GF(64)\n\nThe field  has several interesting properties that smaller fields do not share: it has two subfields such that neither is contained in the other; not all generators (elements with minimal polynomial of degree  over ) are primitive elements; and the primitive elements are not all conjugate under the Galois group.\n\nThe order of this field being , and the divisors of  being , the subfields of  are , , , and  itself. As  and  are coprime, the intersection of  and  in  is the prime field .\n\nThe union of  and  has thus  elements. The remaining  elements of  generate  in the sense that no other subfield contains any of them. It follows that they are roots of irreducible polynomials of degree  over . This implies that, over , there are exactly  irreducible monic polynomials of degree . This may be verified by factoring  over .\n\nThe elements of  are primitive th roots of unity for some  dividing . As the 3rd and the 7th roots of unity belong to  and , respectively, the  generators are primitive th roots of unity for some  in . Euler's totient function shows that there are  primitive th roots of unity,  primitive st roots of unity, and  primitive rd roots of unity. Summing these numbers, one finds again  elements.\n\nBy factoring the cyclotomic polynomials over , one finds that:\n* The six primitive th roots of unity are roots of \n:X^6+X^3+1,\nand are all conjugate under the action of the Galois group.\n* The twelve primitive st roots of unity are roots of \n:(X^6+X^4+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X^2+1).\nThey form two orbits under the action of the Galois group. As the two factors are reciprocal to each other, a root and its (multiplicative) inverse do not belong to the same orbit.\n* The  primitive elements of  are the roots of \n:(X^6+X^4+X^3+X+1)(X^6+X+1)(X^6+X^5+1)(X^6+X^5+X^3+X^2+1)(X^6+X^5+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X+1),\nThey split into 6 orbits of 6 elements under the action of the Galois group.\n\nThis shows that the best choice to construct  is to define it as . In fact, this generator is a primitive element, and this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that produces the easiest Euclidean division.\n\nFrobenius automorphism and Galois theory \n\nIn this section,  is a prime number, and  is a power of .\n\nIn , the identity  implies that the map\n \\varphi:x \\mapsto x^p\nis a -linear endomorphism and a field automorphism of , which fixes every element of the subfield . It is called the Frobenius automorphism, after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.\n\nDenoting by  the composition of  with itself  times, we have \n \\varphi^k:x \\mapsto x^{p^k}.\nIt has been shown in the preceding section that  is the identity. For , the automorphism  is not the identity, as, otherwise, the polynomial \nX^{p^k}-X\nwould have more than  roots.\n\nThere are no other -automorphisms of . In other words,  has exactly  -automorphisms, which are \n\\mathrm{Id}=\\varphi^0, \\varphi, \\varphi^2, \\ldots, \\varphi^{n-1}.\n\nIn terms of Galois theory, this means that  is a Galois extension of , which has a cyclic Galois group.\n\nThe fact that the Frobenius map is surjective implies that every finite field is perfect.\n\nPolynomial factorization\n\nIf  is a finite field, a non-constant monic polynomial with coefficients in  is irreducible over , if it is not the product of two non-constant monic polynomials, with coefficients in .\n\nAs every polynomial ring over a field is a unique factorization domain, every monic polynomial over a finite field may be factored in a unique way (up to the order of the factors) into a product of irreducible monic polynomials.\n\nThere are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite field. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the rational numbers. At least for this reason, every computer algebra system has functions for factoring polynomials over finite fields, or, at least, over finite prime fields.\n\nIrreducible polynomials of a given degree\n\nThe polynomial\nX^q-X \nfactors into linear factors over a field of order . More precisely, this polynomial is the product of all monic polynomials of degree one over a field of order .\n\nThis implies that, if  then  is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials over , whose degree divides . In fact, if  is an irreducible factor over  of , its degree divides , as its splitting field is contained in . Conversely, if  is an irreducible monic polynomial over  of degree  dividing , it defines a field extension of degree , which is contained in , and all roots of  belong to , and are roots of ; thus  divides . As  does not have any multiple factor, it is thus the product of all the irreducible monic polynomials that divide it.\n\nThis property is used to compute the product of the irreducible factors of each degree of polynomials over ; see Distinct degree factorization.\n\nNumber of monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field\n\nThe number  of monic irreducible polynomials of degree  over \n is given by\nN(q,n)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d)q^{\\frac{n}{d}},\nwhere  is the Möbius function. This formula is almost a direct consequence of above property of .\n\nBy the above formula, the number of irreducible (not necessarily monic) polynomials of degree  over  is .\n\nA (slightly simpler) lower bound for  is\nN(q,n)\\geq\\frac{1}{n} \\left(q^n-\\sum_{p|n, \\ p \\text{ prime}} q^{\\frac{n}{p}}\\right).\n\nOne may easily deduce that, for every  and every , there is at least one irreducible polynomial of degree  over . This lower bound is sharp for .\n\nApplications \n\nIn cryptography, the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields or in elliptic curves is the basis of several widely used protocols, such as the Diffie–Hellman protocol. For example, in 2014 a secure internet connection to Wikipedia involved the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman protocol (ECDHE) over a large finite field.This can be verified by looking at the information on the page provided by the browser. In coding theory, many codes are constructed as subspaces of vector spaces over finite fields.\n\nFinite fields are widely used in number theory, as many problems over the integers may be solved by reducing them modulo one or several prime numbers. For example, the fastest known algorithms for polynomial factorization and linear algebra over the field of rational numbers proceed by reduction modulo one or several primes, and then reconstruction of the solution by using Chinese remainder theorem, Hensel lifting or the LLL algorithm.\n\nSimilarly many theoretical problems in number theory can be solved by considering their reductions modulo some or all prime numbers. See, for example, Hasse principle. Many recent developments of algebraic geometry were motivated by the need to enlarge the power of these modular methods. Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields.\n\nExtensions \n\nAlgebraic closure\n\nA finite field  is not algebraically closed. To demonstrate this, consider the polynomial\nf(T)=1+\\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbf{F}} (T-\\alpha),\nwhich has no roots in , since  for all  in .\n\nThe direct limit of the system:\n\nwith inclusion, is an infinite field. It is the algebraic closure of all the fields in the system, and is denoted by: \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}.\n\nThe inclusions commute with the Frobenius map, as it is defined the same way on each field (), so the Frobenius map defines an automorphism of \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}, which carries all subfields back to themselves. In fact  can be recovered as the fixed points of the th iterate of the Frobenius map.\n\nHowever unlike the case of finite fields, the Frobenius automorphism on \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p} has infinite order, and it does not generate the full group of automorphisms of this field.  That is, there are automorphisms of \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p} which are not a power of the Frobenius map. However, the group generated by the Frobenius map is a dense subgroup of the automorphism group in the Krull topology.  Algebraically, this corresponds to the additive group  being dense in the profinite integers (direct product of the -adic integers over all primes , with the product topology).\n\nIf we actually construct our finite fields in such a fashion that  is contained in  whenever  divides , then this direct limit can be constructed as the union of all these fields. Even if we do not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.\n\nWedderburn's little theorem\n\nA division ring is a generalization of field. Division rings are not assumed to be commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: Wedderburn's little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds even if we relax associativity and consider alternative rings, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.\n\nRelationship to other commutative ring classes\n\nFinite fields appear in the following chain of inclusions:",

If all these trinomials are reducible, one chooses \"pentanomials\" , as polynomials of degree greater than , with an even number of terms, are never irreducible in characteristic , having  as a root.\n\nIn the next sections, we will show how this general construction method works for small finite fields.\n\nField with four elements\n\nOver , there is only one irreducible polynomial of degree :\nX^2+X+1\nTherefore, for  the construction of the preceding section must involve this polynomial, and\n{\\rm GF}(4) = {\\rm GF}(2)[X]/(X^2+X+1).\n\nIf one denotes  a root of this polynomial in , the tables of the operations in  are the following. There is no table for subtraction, because subtraction is identical to addition, as is the case for every field of characteristic 2. In the third table, for the division of  by ,  must be read on the left, and  on the top.\n\nfor an odd prime \n\nFor applying the above general construction of finite fields in the case of , one has to find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2. For , this has been done in the preceding section. If  is an odd prime, there are always irreducible polynomials of the form , with  in .\n\nMore precisely, the polynomial  is irreducible over  if and only if  is a quadratic non-residue modulo  (this is almost the definition of a quadratic non-residue). There are \\frac{p-1}{2} quadratic non-residues modulo . For example,  is a quadratic non-residue for , and  is a quadratic non-residue for . If , that is , one may choose  as a quadratic non-residue, which allows us to have a very simple irreducible polynomial .\n\nHaving chosen a quadratic non-residue , let  be a symbolic square root of , that is a symbol which has the property , in the same way as the complex number  is a symbolic square root of . Then, the elements of  are all the linear expressions\na+b\\alpha,\nwith  and  in . The operations on  are defined as follows (the operations between elements of  represented by Latin letters are the operations in ):\n\n\\begin{align}\n-(a+b\\alpha)&=-a+(-b)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)+(c+d\\alpha)&=(a+c)+(b+d)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)(c+d\\alpha)&=(ac + rbd)+ (ad+bc)\\alpha\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha)^{-1}&=a(a^2-rb^2)^{-1}+(-b)(a^2-rb^2)^{-1}\\alpha\n\\end{align}\n\nand \n\nThe polynomial\nX^3-X-1\nis irreducible over  and , that is, it is irreducible modulo  and  (to show this it suffices to show that it has no root in  nor in ). It follows that the elements of  and  may be represented by expressions\na+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2,\nwhere  are elements of  or  (respectively), and \\alpha is a symbol such that \n\\alpha^3=\\alpha+1.\n\nThe addition, additive inverse and multiplication on  and  may thus be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of  or , represented by Latin letters, are the operations in  or , respectively:\n\n\\begin{align}\n-(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)&=-a+(-b)\\alpha+(-c)\\alpha^2 \\qquad\\text{(for } \\mathrm{GF}(8), \\text{this operation is the identity)}\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)+(d+e\\alpha+f\\alpha^2)&=(a+d)+(b+e)\\alpha+(c+f)\\alpha^2\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)(d+e\\alpha+f\\alpha^2)&=(ad + bf+ce)+ (ae+bd+bf+ce+cf)\\alpha+(af+be+cd+cf)\\alpha^2\n\\end{align}\n\nThe polynomial\nX^4+X+1\nis irreducible over , that is, it is irreducible modulo . It follows that the elements of  may be represented by expressions\na+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3,\nwhere  are either  or  (elements of ), and  is a symbol such that \n\\alpha^4=\\alpha+1.\n\nAs the characteristic of  is , each element is its additive inverse in .\nThe addition and multiplication on  may be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of , represented by Latin letters are the operations in .\n\n\\begin{align}\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3)+(e+f\\alpha+g\\alpha^2+h\\alpha^3)&=(a+e)+(b+f)\\alpha+(c+g)\\alpha^2+(d+h)\\alpha^3\\\\\n(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2+d\\alpha^3)(e+f\\alpha+g\\alpha^2+h\\alpha^3)&=(ae+bh+cg+df)\n+(af+be+bh+cg+df +ch+dg)\\alpha\\;+\\\\\n&\\quad\\;(ag+bf+ce +ch+dg+dh)\\alpha^2\n+(ah+bg+cf+de +dh)\\alpha^3\n\\end{align}\n\nMultiplicative structure \n\nThe set of non-zero elements in  is an abelian group under the multiplication, of order . By Lagrange's theorem, there exists a divisor  of  such that  for every non-zero  in . As the equation  has at most  solutions in any field,  is the lowest possible value for .\nThe structure theorem of finite abelian groups implies that this multiplicative group is cyclic, that is, all non-zero elements are powers of a single element. In summary:\nThe multiplicative group of the non-zero elements in  is cyclic, and there exist an element , such that the  non-zero elements of  are .\n\nSuch an element  is called a primitive element. Unless , the primitive element is not unique. The number of primitive elements is  where  is Euler's totient function.\n\nThe result above implies that  for every  in . The particular case where  is prime is Fermat's little theorem.\n\nDiscrete logarithm \n\nIf  is a primitive element in , then for any non-zero element  in , there is a unique integer  with  such that\n.\nThis integer  is called the discrete logarithm of  to the base .\n\nWhile  can be computed very quickly, for example using exponentiation by squaring, there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the inverse operation, the discrete logarithm. This has been used in various cryptographic protocols, see Discrete logarithm for details.\n\nWhen the nonzero elements of  are represented by their discrete logarithms, multiplication and division are easy, as they reduce to addition and subtraction modulo . However, addition amounts to computing the discrete logarithm of . The identity \nallows one to solve this problem by constructing the table of the discrete logarithms of , called Zech's logarithms, for  (it is convenient to define the discrete logarithm of zero as being ).\n\nZech's logarithms are useful for large computations, such as linear algebra over medium-sized fields, that is, fields that are sufficiently large for making natural algorithms inefficient, but not too large, as one has to pre-compute a table of the same size as the order of the field.\n\nRoots of unity\n\nEvery nonzero element of a finite field is a root of unity, as  for every nonzero element of .\n\nIf  is a positive integer, an th primitive root of unity is a solution of the equation  that is not a solution of the equation  for any positive integer . If  is a th primitive root of unity in a field , then  contains all the  roots of unity, which are .\n\nThe field  contains a th primitive root of unity if and only if  is a divisor of ; if  is a divisor of , then the number of primitive th roots of unity in  is  (Euler's totient function). The number of th roots of unity in  is .\n\nIn a field of characteristic , every th root of unity is also a th root of unity. It follows that primitive th roots of unity never exist in a field of characteristic .\n\nOn the other hand, if  is coprime to , the roots of the th cyclotomic polynomial are distinct in every field of characteristic , as this polynomial is a divisor of , whose discriminant  is nonzero modulo . It follows that the th cyclotomic polynomial factors over  into distinct irreducible polynomials that have all the same degree, say , and that  is the smallest field of characteristic  that contains the th primitive roots of unity.\n\nExample: GF(64)\n\nThe field  has several interesting properties that smaller fields do not share: it has two subfields such that neither is contained in the other; not all generators (elements with minimal polynomial of degree  over ) are primitive elements; and the primitive elements are not all conjugate under the Galois group.\n\nThe order of this field being , and the divisors of  being , the subfields of  are , , , and  itself. As  and  are coprime, the intersection of  and  in  is the prime field .\n\nThe union of  and  has thus  elements. The remaining  elements of  generate  in the sense that no other subfield contains any of them. It follows that they are roots of irreducible polynomials of degree  over . This implies that, over , there are exactly  irreducible monic polynomials of degree . This may be verified by factoring  over .\n\nThe elements of  are primitive th roots of unity for some  dividing . As the 3rd and the 7th roots of unity belong to  and , respectively, the  generators are primitive th roots of unity for some  in . Euler's totient function shows that there are  primitive th roots of unity,  primitive st roots of unity, and  primitive rd roots of unity. Summing these numbers, one finds again  elements.\n\nBy factoring the cyclotomic polynomials over , one finds that:\n* The six primitive th roots of unity are roots of \n:X^6+X^3+1,\nand are all conjugate under the action of the Galois group.\n* The twelve primitive st roots of unity are roots of \n:(X^6+X^4+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X^2+1).\nThey form two orbits under the action of the Galois group. As the two factors are reciprocal to each other, a root and its (multiplicative) inverse do not belong to the same orbit.\n* The  primitive elements of  are the roots of \n:(X^6+X^4+X^3+X+1)(X^6+X+1)(X^6+X^5+1)(X^6+X^5+X^3+X^2+1)(X^6+X^5+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X+1),\nThey split into 6 orbits of 6 elements under the action of the Galois group.\n\nThis shows that the best choice to construct  is to define it as . In fact, this generator is a primitive element, and this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that produces the easiest Euclidean division.\n\nFrobenius automorphism and Galois theory \n\nIn this section,  is a prime number, and  is a power of .\n\nIn , the identity  implies that the map\n \\varphi:x \\mapsto x^p\nis a -linear endomorphism and a field automorphism of , which fixes every element of the subfield . It is called the Frobenius automorphism, after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.\n\nDenoting by  the composition of  with itself  times, we have \n \\varphi^k:x \\mapsto x^{p^k}.\nIt has been shown in the preceding section that  is the identity. For , the automorphism  is not the identity, as, otherwise, the polynomial \nX^{p^k}-X\nwould have more than  roots.\n\nThere are no other -automorphisms of . In other words,  has exactly  -automorphisms, which are \n\\mathrm{Id}=\\varphi^0, \\varphi, \\varphi^2, \\ldots, \\varphi^{n-1}.\n\nIn terms of Galois theory, this means that  is a Galois extension of , which has a cyclic Galois group.\n\nThe fact that the Frobenius map is surjective implies that every finite field is perfect.\n\nPolynomial factorization\n\nIf  is a finite field, a non-constant monic polynomial with coefficients in  is irreducible over , if it is not the product of two non-constant monic polynomials, with coefficients in .\n\nAs every polynomial ring over a field is a unique factorization domain, every monic polynomial over a finite field may be factored in a unique way (up to the order of the factors) into a product of irreducible monic polynomials.\n\nThere are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite field. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the rational numbers. At least for this reason, every computer algebra system has functions for factoring polynomials over finite fields, or, at least, over finite prime fields.\n\nIrreducible polynomials of a given degree\n\nThe polynomial\nX^q-X \nfactors into linear factors over a field of order . More precisely, this polynomial is the product of all monic polynomials of degree one over a field of order .\n\nThis implies that, if  then  is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials over , whose degree divides . In fact, if  is an irreducible factor over  of , its degree divides , as its splitting field is contained in . Conversely, if  is an irreducible monic polynomial over  of degree  dividing , it defines a field extension of degree , which is contained in , and all roots of  belong to , and are roots of ; thus  divides . As  does not have any multiple factor, it is thus the product of all the irreducible monic polynomials that divide it.\n\nThis property is used to compute the product of the irreducible factors of each degree of polynomials over ; see Distinct degree factorization.\n\nNumber of monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field\n\nThe number  of monic irreducible polynomials of degree  over \n is given by\nN(q,n)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d)q^{\\frac{n}{d}},\nwhere  is the Möbius function. This formula is almost a direct consequence of above property of .\n\nBy the above formula, the number of irreducible (not necessarily monic) polynomials of degree  over  is .\n\nA (slightly simpler) lower bound for  is\nN(q,n)\\geq\\frac{1}{n} \\left(q^n-\\sum_{p|n, \\ p \\text{ prime}} q^{\\frac{n}{p}}\\right).\n\nOne may easily deduce that, for every  and every , there is at least one irreducible polynomial of degree  over . This lower bound is sharp for .\n\nApplications \n\nIn cryptography, the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields or in elliptic curves is the basis of several widely used protocols, such as the Diffie–Hellman protocol. For example, in 2014 a secure internet connection to Wikipedia involved the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman protocol (ECDHE) over a large finite field.This can be verified by looking at the information on the page provided by the browser. In coding theory, many codes are constructed as subspaces of vector spaces over finite fields.\n\nFinite fields are widely used in number theory, as many problems over the integers may be solved by reducing them modulo one or several prime numbers. For example, the fastest known algorithms for polynomial factorization and linear algebra over the field of rational numbers proceed by reduction modulo one or several primes, and then reconstruction of the solution by using Chinese remainder theorem, Hensel lifting or the LLL algorithm.\n\nSimilarly many theoretical problems in number theory can be solved by considering their reductions modulo some or all prime numbers. See, for example, Hasse principle. Many recent developments of algebraic geometry were motivated by the need to enlarge the power of these modular methods. Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields.\n\nExtensions \n\nAlgebraic closure\n\nA finite field  is not algebraically closed. To demonstrate this, consider the polynomial\nf(T)=1+\\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbf{F}} (T-\\alpha),\nwhich has no roots in , since  for all  in .\n\nThe direct limit of the system:\n\nwith inclusion, is an infinite field. It is the algebraic closure of all the fields in the system, and is denoted by: \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}.\n\nThe inclusions commute with the Frobenius map, as it is defined the same way on each field (), so the Frobenius map defines an automorphism of \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}, which carries all subfields back to themselves. In fact  can be recovered as the fixed points of the th iterate of the Frobenius map.\n\nHowever unlike the case of finite fields, the Frobenius automorphism on \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p} has infinite order, and it does not generate the full group of automorphisms of this field.  That is, there are automorphisms of \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p} which are not a power of the Frobenius map. However, the group generated by the Frobenius map is a dense subgroup of the automorphism group in the Krull topology.  Algebraically, this corresponds to the additive group  being dense in the profinite integers (direct product of the -adic integers over all primes , with the product topology).\n\nIf we actually construct our finite fields in such a fashion that  is contained in  whenever  divides , then this direct limit can be constructed as the union of all these fields. Even if we do not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.\n\nWedderburn's little theorem\n\nA division ring is a generalization of field. Division rings are not assumed to be commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: Wedderburn's little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds even if we relax associativity and consider alternative rings, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.\n\nRelationship to other commutative ring classes\n\nFinite fields appear in the following chain of inclusions:.
