  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the Hahn–Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. It allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are \"enough\" continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space \"interesting\". Another version of the Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem or the separating hyperplane theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry.\n\nThe theorem is named for the mathematicians Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach, who proved it independently in the late 1920s. The special case of the theorem for the space C \\left[a, b \\right] of continuous functions on an interval was proved earlier (in 1912) by Eduard Helly, and a more general extension theorem, the M. Riesz extension theorem, from which the Hahn–Banach theorem can be derived, was proved in 1923 by Marcel Riesz.See M. Riesz extension theorem. According to , the argument was known to Riesz already in 1918.\n\nFormulation \n\nThe most general formulation of the theorem needs some preparation. Given a real vector space , a function  is called sublinear if\n* Positive homogeneity:  for all ,\n* Subadditivity:  for all .\n\nEvery seminorm on  (in particular, every norm on ) is sublinear. Other sublinear functions can be useful as well, especially Minkowski functionals of convex sets.\n\nHahn–Banach theorem . If  is a sublinear function, and  is a linear functional on a linear subspace  which is dominated by  on , i.e.\n\n\\varphi(x) \\leq p(x)\\qquad\\forall x \\in U\n\nthen there exists a linear extension  of  to the whole space , i.e., there exists a linear functional  such that\n\n\\psi(x)=\\varphi(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in U,\n\\psi(x) \\le p(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in V.\n\nHahn–Banach theorem (alternative version). Set  or  and let  be a -vector space with a seminorm . If  is a -linear functional on a -linear subspace  of  which is dominated by  on  in absolute value,\n\n|\\varphi(x)|\\leq p(x)\\qquad\\forall x \\in U\n\nthen there exists a linear extension  of  to the whole space , i.e., there exists a -linear functional  such that\n\n\\psi(x)=\\varphi(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in U,\n|\\psi(x)| \\le p(x)\\qquad\\forall x\\in V.\n\nIn the complex case of the alternate version, the -linearity assumptions demand, in addition to the assumptions for the real case, that for every vector ,  we have  and .\n\nThe extension  is in general not uniquely specified by  and the proof gives no explicit method as to how to find . The usual proof for the case of an infinite dimensional space  uses Zorn's lemma or, equivalently, the axiom of choice. It is now known (see below) that the ultrafilter lemma, which is slightly weaker than the axiom of choice, is actually strong enough.\n\nIt is possible to relax slightly the subadditivity condition on , requiring only that (Reed and Simon, 1980):\n\np(ax+by)\\leq|a| \\, p(x) + |b| \\, p(y),\\qquad x,y\\in V,\\quad |a|+|b|\\leq1.\n\nThis reveals the intimate connection between the Hahn–Banach theorem and convexity.\n\nThe Mizar project has completely formalized and automatically checked the proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem in the HAHNBAN file.[http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/JFM/Vol5/hahnban.html HAHNBAN file]\n\nImportant consequences \n\nThe theorem has several important consequences, some of which are also sometimes called \"Hahn–Banach theorem\":\n* If  is a normed vector space with linear subspace  (not necessarily closed) and if  is continuous and linear, then there exists an extension  of  which is also continuous and linear and which has the same norm as  (see Banach space for a discussion of the norm of a linear map). In other words, in the category of normed vector spaces, the space  is an injective object.\n* If  is a normed vector space with linear subspace  (not necessarily closed) and if  is an element of  not in the closure of , then there exists a continuous linear map  with  for all  in , , and .\n* In particular, if  is a normed vector space and if  is any element of , then there exists a continuous linear map  with  and .  This implies that the natural injection  from a normed space  into its  double dual  is isometric.\n\nHahn–Banach separation theorem \n\nAnother version of Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem.Gabriel Nagy, [http://www.math.ksu.edu/~nagy/real-an/ap-e-h-b.pdf  Real Analysis] [http://www.math.ksu.edu/~nagy/real-an/ lecture notes] It has numerous uses in convex geometry, optimization theory, and economics. The separation theorem is derived from the original form of the theorem.\n\nTheorem. Set  or  and let  be a topological vector space over . If  are convex, non-empty disjoint subsets of , then:\n*If  is open, then there exists a continuous linear map  and  such that  for all .\n*If  is locally convex,  is compact, and  closed, then there exists a continuous linear map  and  such that  for all .\n\nGeometric Hahn–Banach theorem \n\nOne form of Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Geometric Hahn–Banach theorem, or Mazur's theorem.\n\nTheorem. Let  be a convex set having a nonempty interior in a real normed linear vector space . Suppose  is a linear variety in  containing no interior points of .

Let  be a vector subspace of the topological vector space . Suppose  is a non-empty convex open subset of  with . Then there is a closed hyperplane  in  containing  with .\n\nRelation to axiom of choice \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the axiom of choice implies the Hahn–Banach theorem. The converse is not true. One way to see that is by noting that the ultrafilter lemma (or equivalently, the Boolean prime ideal theorem), which is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice, can be used to show the Hahn–Banach theorem, although the converse is not the case.\n\nThe Hahn–Banach theorem is equivalent to the following:\n\n(∗): On every Boolean algebra  there exists a \"probability charge\", that is: a nonconstant finitely additive map from  into .\n\n(The Boolean prime ideal theorem is easily seen to be equivalent to the statement that there are always probability charges which take only the values 0 and 1.)\n\nIn ZF, one can show that the Hahn–Banach theorem is enough to derive the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set. Moreover, the Hahn–Banach theorem implies the Banach–Tarski paradox.\n\nFor separable Banach spaces, D. K. Brown and S. G. Simpson proved that the Hahn–Banach theorem follows from WKL0, a weak subsystem of second-order arithmetic that takes a form of König's lemma restricted to binary trees as an axiom. In fact, they prove that under a weak set of assumptions, the two are equivalent, an example of reverse mathematics.
