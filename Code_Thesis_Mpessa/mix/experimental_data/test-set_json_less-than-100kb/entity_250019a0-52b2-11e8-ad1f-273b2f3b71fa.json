  "textBody" : "John William Polidori (7 September 1795 – 24 August 1821) was an English writer and physician. He is known for his associations with the Romantic movement and credited by some as the creator of the vampire genre of fantasy fiction. His most successful work was the short story \"The Vampyre\" (1819), the first published modern vampire story. Although originally and erroneously accredited to Lord Byron, both Byron and Polidori affirmed that the story is Polidori's.\n\nFamily\n\nJohn William Polidori was born on 7 September 1795 in London, the oldest son of Gaetano Polidori, an Italian political émigré scholar, and Anna Maria Pierce, an English governess. He had three brothers and four sisters.\n\nHis sister, Frances Polidori, married exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti, and thus John was the uncle of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, and Christina Georgina Rossetti, though they were born after his death. William Michael Rossetti published Polidori's journal in 1911.\n\nBiography\n\nPolidori was one of the earliest pupils at recently established Ampleforth College from 1804, and in 1810, went to the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a thesis on sleepwalking and received his degree as a doctor of medicine on 1 August 1815, at age 19.\n\nIn 1816, Dr. Polidori entered Lord Byron's service as his personal physician and accompanied him on a trip through Europe. Publisher John Murray offered Polidori 500 English pounds to keep a diary of their travels, which Polidori's nephew William Michael Rossetti later edited.  At the Villa Diodati, a house Byron rented by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, the pair met with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, her husband-to-be, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their companion (Mary's stepsister) Claire Clairmont.\n\nOne night in June, after the company had read aloud from Fantasmagoriana, a French collection of German horror tales, Byron suggested they each write a ghost story. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote \"A Fragment of a Ghost Story\" and wrote down five ghost stories recounted by Matthew Gregory \"Monk\" Lewis, published posthumously as the Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories) and on return to England, 1816, the journal entries beginning on 18 August 1816. Mary Shelley worked on a tale with her husband that would later evolve into Frankenstein.[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/rieger.html Rieger, James. \"Dr. Polidori and the Genesis of Frankenstein.\" Studies in English Literature 1500-1900, 3 (Winter 1963), 461-72.] Byron wrote (and quickly abandoned) a fragment of a story, \"A Fragment\", featuring the main character Augustus Darvell, which Polidori used later as the basis for his own tale, \"The Vampyre\", the first published modern vampire story in English.\n\nPolidori's conversation with Percy Bysshe Shelley on 15 June 1816, as recounted in The Diary, is regarded as the origin or genesis of Frankenstein. They discussed principles, \n\"the nature of the principle of life\": \"June 15 - ... Shelley etc. came in the evening ... Afterwards, Shelley and I had a conversation about principles - whether man was to be thought merely an instrument.\"[https://books.google.com/books?idkdEbDQAAQBAJ&pg\nPT26&lpgPT26&dq\nman+as+an+instrument+polidori&sourcebl&ots\nYMYwyAViax&sigSaQzx4xrk_GtDuWoBnBAiU51O1c&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwiWwrXfocXVAhXEYiYKHRjqCAwQ6AEIMDAC#vonepage&q\nman%20as%20an%20instrument%20polidori&f=false Frayling, Christopher.

His story, \"The Vampyre\", which featured the main character Lord Ruthven, was published in the April 1819 issue of New Monthly Magazine without his permission. Whilst in London he lived on Great Pulteney Street (in Soho). Much to both his and Byron's chagrin, \"The Vampyre\" was released as a new work by Byron. Byron's own vampire story \"Fragment of a Novel\" or \"A Fragment\" was published in 1819 in an attempt to clear up the confusion, but, for better or worse, \"The Vampyre\" continued to be attributed to him.\n\nPolidori's long, Byron-influenced theological poem The Fall of the Angels was published anonymously in 1821.\n\nDeath\n\nPolidori died in London on 24 August 1821, weighed down by depression and gambling debts. Despite strong evidence that he committed suicide by means of prussic acid (cyanide), the coroner gave a verdict of death by natural causes.\n\nWorks\n\n* A Medical Inaugural Dissertation which deals with the disease called Oneirodynia, for the degree of Medical Doctor, Edinburgh (1815)\n* The Diary of Dr. John William Polidori (1816, published posthumously in 1911)\n* Cajetan, a play (1816)\n* Boadicea, a play (1816)\n* On the Punishment of Death (1816)\n* An Essay Upon the Source of Positive Pleasure (1818)\n* The Vampyre: A Tale (1819) - a text that is \"often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism\".\n* Ernestus Berchtold; or, The Modern Oedipus: A Tale (1819)\n* Ximenes, The Wreath and Other Poems (1819)\n* The Fall of the Angels: A Sacred Poem (1821)\n* Sketches Illustrative of the Manners and Costumes of France, Switzerland and Italy (1821)\n\nPosthumous editions\n\nHis sister Charlotte transcribed Polidori's diaries, but censored \"peccant passages\" and destroyed the original.
