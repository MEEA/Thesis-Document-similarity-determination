These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.\n\nThe Hebrides are the source of much of Scottish Gaelic literature and Gaelic music. Today the economy of the islands is dependent on crofting, fishing, tourism, the oil industry, and renewable energy. The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Scotland, but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds.\n\nGeology, geography and climate \n\nThe Hebrides have a diverse geology ranging in age from Precambrian strata that are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe to Paleogene igneous intrusions.Rollinson, Hugh (September 1997). [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/gday/1997/00000013/00000005/art00011 \"Britain's oldest rocks\"] Geology Today. 13 no. 5 pp. 185-190.Gillen, Con (2003). Geology and landscapes of Scotland. Harpenden. Terra Publishing. Pages 44 and 142. Raised shore platforms in the Hebrides are identified as strandflats formed possibly in Pliocene times and later modified by the Quaternary glaciations. \n\nThe Hebrides can be divided into two main groups, separated from one another by the Minch to the north and the Sea of the Hebrides to the south. The Inner Hebrides lie closer to mainland Scotland and include Islay, Jura, Skye, Mull, Raasay, Staffa and the Small Isles. There are 36 inhabited islands in this group. The Outer Hebrides are a chain of more than 100 islands and small skerries located about 70 km west of mainland Scotland. There are 15 inhabited islands in this archipelago. The main islands include Barra, Benbecula, Berneray, Harris, Lewis, North Uist, South Uist, and St Kilda. In total, the islands have an area of approximately 7200 km2 and a population of 44,759.General Register Office for Scotland (28 November 2003) [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/census/censushm/occpapers/occasional-paper-10.html Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands]. (pdf) Retrieved 22 January 2011. \n\nA complication is that there are various descriptions of the scope of the Hebrides. The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying \"east of the Minch\", which would include any and all offshore islands. There are various islands that lie in the sea lochs such as  and  that might not ordinarily be described as \"Hebridean\", but no formal definitions exist.Keay & Keay (1994) p. 507.Encyclopædia Britannica (1978) states: Hebrides – group of islands of the west coast of Scotland extending in an arc between 55.35 and 58.30 N and 5.26 and 8.40 W.\" This includes Gigha, St Kilda and everything up to Cape Wrath – although not North Rona.\n\nIn the past, the Outer Hebrides were often referred to as the Long Isle (). Today, they are also known as the Western Isles, although this phrase can also be used to refer to the Hebrides in general.\n\nThe Hebrides have a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. In the Outer Hebrides the average temperature for the year is 6 °C (44 °F) in January and 14 °C (57 °F) in summer. The average annual rainfall in Lewis is 1100 mm and sunshine hours range from 1,100 – 1,200 per annum. The summer days are relatively long, and May to August is the driest period.Thompson (1968) pp. 24–26\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory \n\nThe Hebrides were settled during the Mesolithic era around 6500 BC or earlier, after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement. Occupation at a site on  is dated to 8590 ±95 uncorrected radiocarbon years BP, which is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.Edwards, Kevin J. and Whittington, Graeme \"Vegetation Change\" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 70Edwards, Kevin J., and Mithen, Steven (Feb., 1995) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/124921 \"The Colonization of the Hebridean Islands of Western Scotland: Evidence from the Palynological and Archaeological Records,\"] World Archaeology. 26.

This may have been a reference to the stone circle at Callanish.See for example Haycock, David Boyd.

He stated it was a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands, but he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island.Moffat, Alistair (2005) Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History. London. Thames & Hudson. pp. 239-40.\n\nThe first written records of native life begin in the 6th century AD, when the founding of the kingdom of Dál Riata took place.Nieke, Margaret R. \"Secular Society from the Iron Age to Dál Riata and the Kingdom of Scots\" in Omand (2006) p. 60 This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland.Lynch (2007)  pp. 161 162 The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Dál Riata, and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba, and Tiree, are known from the annals.Clancy, Thomas Owen \"Church institutions: early medieval\" in Lynch (2001).\n\nNorth of Dál Riata, the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, although the historical record is sparse. Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century: \"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.”Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49\n\nNorwegian control \n\nViking raids began on Scottish shores towards the end of the 8th century and the Hebrides came under Norse control and settlement during the ensuing decades, especially following the success of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of  in 872.Hunter (2000) p. 74Rotary Club (1995) p. 12 In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose may have been the dominant figure of the mid 9th century, by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders. These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown, although in practice the latter's control was fairly limited.Hunter (2000) p. 78 Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway.Hunter (2000) p. 102 The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered Orkney, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various island petty kingdoms. By capturing the islands Magnus imposed a more direct royal control, although at a price. His skald Bjorn Cripplehand recorded that in Lewis \"fire played high in the heaven\" as \"flame spouted from the houses\" and that in the Uists \"the king dyed his sword red in blood\".\n\nThe Hebrides were now part of the Kingdom of the Isles, whose rulers were themselves vassals of the Kings of Norway. This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156, at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke out under Somerled, the Norse-Gael kinsman of the Manx royal house.[https://thevikingworld.pbworks.com/The-Kingdom-of-Mann-and-the-Isles \"The Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\"] thevikingworld.com Retrieved 6 July 2010.\n\nFollowing the ill-fated 1263 expedition of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Man were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth.Hunter (2000) pp. 109-111 Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and place names, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.Thompson (1968) p. 37\n\nScottish control \n\nAs the Norse era drew to a close, the Norse-speaking princes were gradually replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, Clan Donald and MacNeil of Barra.Thompson (1968) p. 39Rotary Club (1995) pp. 27, 30 This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.Hunter (2000) pp. 127, 166\n\nThe Lords of the Isles ruled the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. A rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the family's lands in 1493.Oram, Richard \"The Lordship of the Isles: 1336–1545\" in Omand (2006) pp. 135–38\n\nIn 1598, King James VI authorised some \"Gentleman Adventurers\" from Fife to civilise the \"most barbarous Isle of Lewis\".Rotary Club (1995) pp. 12-13 Initially successful, the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod, who based their forces on  in . The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result, but a third attempt in 1607 was more successful and in due course Stornoway became a Burgh of Barony.Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 312 By this time, Lewis was held by the Mackenzies of Kintail (later the Earls of Seaforth), who pursued a more enlightened approach, investing in fishing in particular. The Seaforths' royalist inclinations led to Lewis becoming garrisoned during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway.Thompson (1968) pp. 41-42\n\nEarly British era\n\nWith the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707, the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, but the clans' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong. A considerable number of islesmen \"came out\" in support of the Jacobite Earl of Mar in the \"15\" and again in the 1745 rising including Macleod of Dunvegan and MacLea of Lismore.[http://www.castlescotland.net/the-castles/d/dunvegan.html \"Dunvegan\"]  castlescotland.net Retrieved 17 January 2011.[http://www.clanmclea.co.uk/Donald_Livingstone.htm \"Incidents of the Jacobite Risings - Donald Livingstone\"] clanmclea.co.uk.

The British government's strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English-speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them.Hunter (2000) pp. 195–96, 204–06 This may have brought peace to the islands, but in the following century it came at a terrible price. In the wake of the rebellion, the clan system was broken up and islands of the Hebrides became a series of landed estates.Hunter (2000) pp. 207–08\n\nThe early 19th century was a time of improvement and population growth. Roads and quays were built; the slate industry became a significant employer on Easdale and surrounding islands; and the construction of the Crinan and Caledonian canals and other engineering works such as Telford's \"Bridge across the Atlantic\" improved transport and access.Duncan, P. J. \"The Industries of Argyll: Tradition and Improvement\" in Omand (2006) pp. 152-53 However, in the mid-19th century, the inhabitants of many parts of the Hebrides were devastated by the Clearances, which destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms.Hunter (2000) p. 212 The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands' kelp industry that thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815Hunter (2000) pp. 247, 262Duncan, P.

In the 1880s, the \"Battle of the Braes\" involved a demonstration against unfair land regulation and eviction, stimulating the calling of the Napier Commission. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters' Act.Hunter (2000) pp. 308-23\n\nModern economy\n\nFor those who remained, new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism.Hunter (2000) p. 292 Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of manyHunter (2000) p. 343 and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th century and for much of the 20th century.Duncan, P.

The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries.\n\nThe widespread immigration of mainlanders, particularly non-Gaelic speakers, has been a subject of controversy.\n\nMedia and the arts\n\nMusic\n\nMany contemporary Gaelic musicians have roots in the Hebrides, including Julie Fowlis (North Uist), Catherine-Ann MacPhee (Barra), Kathleen MacInnes (South Uist), and Ishbel MacAskill (Lewis).

Due to Scots and English being favoured in government and the educational system, the Hebrides have been in a state of diglossia since at least the 17th century. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late as the end of the 19th century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language.

The majority are Norse or Gaelic but the roots of several other Hebrides may have a pre-Celtic origin. Adomnán, the 7th century abbot of Iona, records Colonsay as Colosus and Tiree as Ethica, both of which may be pre-Celtic names.Watson (1994) p. 85-86 The etymology of Skye is complex and may also include a pre-Celtic root. Lewis is ' in Old Norse and although various suggestions have been made as to a Norse meaning (such as \"song house\") (2003) p. 80 the name is not of Gaelic origin and the Norse credentials are questionable.\n\nThe earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken by Donald Monro in 1549, which in some cases also provides the earliest written form of the island name. The derivations of all of the inhabited islands of the Hebrides and some of the larger uninhabited ones are listed below.\n\nOuter Hebrides \n\nLewis and Harris is the largest island in Scotland and the third largest in the British Isles, after Great Britain and Ireland.Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 262. It incorporates Lewis in the north and Harris in the south, both of which are frequently referred to as individual islands, although they are joined by a land border. Remarkably, the island does not have a common name in either English or Gaelic and is referred to as \"Lewis and Harris\", \"Lewis with Harris\", \"Harris with Lewis\" etc. For this reason it is treated as two separate islands below.Thompson (1968) p. 13. The derivation of Lewis may be pre-Celtic (see above) and the origin of Harris is no less problematic.

For example, Adomnán records Sainea, Elena, Ommon and Oideacha in the Inner Hebrides, which names must have passed out of usage in the Norse era and whose locations are not clear.Watson (1994) p. 93 One of the complexities is that an island may have had a Celtic name, which was replaced by a similar-sounding Norse name, but then reverted to an essentially Gaelic name with a Norse \"øy\" or \"ey\" ending.Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 482, 486 See for example Rona below.\n\nUninhabited islands \n\nThe names of uninhabited islands follow the same general patterns as the inhabited islands. The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their outliers.\n\nThe etymology of St Kilda, a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides, and its main island Hirta, is very complex. No saint is known by the name of Kilda, and various theories have been proposed for the word's origin, which dates from the late 16th century.Buchanan (1983) Pages 2–6. Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name \"St Kilda\" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse ' (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring ' was dedicated to a saint. (' is a tautological placename, consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well, i.e. \"well well\").Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 314–25.

These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.\n\nThe Hebrides are the source of much of Scottish Gaelic literature and Gaelic music. Today the economy of the islands is dependent on crofting, fishing, tourism, the oil industry, and renewable energy. The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Scotland, but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds.\n\nGeology, geography and climate \n\nThe Hebrides have a diverse geology ranging in age from Precambrian strata that are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe to Paleogene igneous intrusions.Rollinson, Hugh (September 1997).

Harpenden. Terra Publishing. Pages 44 and 142. Raised shore platforms in the Hebrides are identified as strandflats formed possibly in Pliocene times and later modified by the Quaternary glaciations. \n\nThe Hebrides can be divided into two main groups, separated from one another by the Minch to the north and the Sea of the Hebrides to the south. The Inner Hebrides lie closer to mainland Scotland and include Islay, Jura, Skye, Mull, Raasay, Staffa and the Small Isles. There are 36 inhabited islands in this group. The Outer Hebrides are a chain of more than 100 islands and small skerries located about 70 km west of mainland Scotland. There are 15 inhabited islands in this archipelago. The main islands include Barra, Benbecula, Berneray, Harris, Lewis, North Uist, South Uist, and St Kilda. In total, the islands have an area of approximately 7200 km2 and a population of 44,759.General Register Office for Scotland (28 November 2003) [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/census/censushm/occpapers/occasional-paper-10.html Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands].

The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying \"east of the Minch\", which would include any and all offshore islands. There are various islands that lie in the sea lochs such as  and  that might not ordinarily be described as \"Hebridean\", but no formal definitions exist.Keay & Keay (1994) p. 507.Encyclopædia Britannica (1978) states: Hebrides – group of islands of the west coast of Scotland extending in an arc between 55.35 and 58.30 N and 5.26 and 8.40 W.\" This includes Gigha, St Kilda and everything up to Cape Wrath – although not North Rona.\n\nIn the past, the Outer Hebrides were often referred to as the Long Isle (). Today, they are also known as the Western Isles, although this phrase can also be used to refer to the Hebrides in general.\n\nThe Hebrides have a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. In the Outer Hebrides the average temperature for the year is 6 °C (44 °F) in January and 14 °C (57 °F) in summer. The average annual rainfall in Lewis is 1100 mm and sunshine hours range from 1,100 – 1,200 per annum. The summer days are relatively long, and May to August is the driest period.Thompson (1968) pp. 24–26\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory \n\nThe Hebrides were settled during the Mesolithic era around 6500 BC or earlier, after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement.

He stated it was a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands, but he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island.Moffat, Alistair (2005) Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History. London. Thames & Hudson. pp. 239-40.\n\nThe first written records of native life begin in the 6th century AD, when the founding of the kingdom of Dál Riata took place.Nieke, Margaret R. \"Secular Society from the Iron Age to Dál Riata and the Kingdom of Scots\" in Omand (2006) p. 60 This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland.Lynch (2007)  pp. 161 162 The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Dál Riata, and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba, and Tiree, are known from the annals.Clancy, Thomas Owen \"Church institutions: early medieval\" in Lynch (2001).\n\nNorth of Dál Riata, the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, although the historical record is sparse. Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century: \"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.”Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49\n\nNorwegian control \n\nViking raids began on Scottish shores towards the end of the 8th century and the Hebrides came under Norse control and settlement during the ensuing decades, especially following the success of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of  in 872.Hunter (2000) p. 74Rotary Club (1995) p. 12 In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose may have been the dominant figure of the mid 9th century, by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders. These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown, although in practice the latter's control was fairly limited.Hunter (2000) p. 78 Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway.Hunter (2000) p. 102 The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered Orkney, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various island petty kingdoms. By capturing the islands Magnus imposed a more direct royal control, although at a price. His skald Bjorn Cripplehand recorded that in Lewis \"fire played high in the heaven\" as \"flame spouted from the houses\" and that in the Uists \"the king dyed his sword red in blood\".\n\nThe Hebrides were now part of the Kingdom of the Isles, whose rulers were themselves vassals of the Kings of Norway. This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156, at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke out under Somerled, the Norse-Gael kinsman of the Manx royal house.[https://thevikingworld.pbworks.com/The-Kingdom-of-Mann-and-the-Isles \"The Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\"] thevikingworld.com Retrieved 6 July 2010.\n\nFollowing the ill-fated 1263 expedition of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Man were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth.Hunter (2000) pp. 109-111 Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and place names, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.Thompson (1968) p. 37\n\nScottish control \n\nAs the Norse era drew to a close, the Norse-speaking princes were gradually replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, Clan Donald and MacNeil of Barra.Thompson (1968) p. 39Rotary Club (1995) pp. 27, 30 This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.Hunter (2000) pp. 127, 166\n\nThe Lords of the Isles ruled the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. A rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the family's lands in 1493.Oram, Richard \"The Lordship of the Isles: 1336–1545\" in Omand (2006) pp. 135–38\n\nIn 1598, King James VI authorised some \"Gentleman Adventurers\" from Fife to civilise the \"most barbarous Isle of Lewis\".Rotary Club (1995) pp. 12-13 Initially successful, the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod, who based their forces on  in . The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result, but a third attempt in 1607 was more successful and in due course Stornoway became a Burgh of Barony.Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 312 By this time, Lewis was held by the Mackenzies of Kintail (later the Earls of Seaforth), who pursued a more enlightened approach, investing in fishing in particular. The Seaforths' royalist inclinations led to Lewis becoming garrisoned during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway.Thompson (1968) pp. 41-42\n\nEarly British era\n\nWith the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707, the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, but the clans' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong.

J. \"The Industries of Argyll: Tradition and Improvement\" in Omand (2006) pp. 152-53 However, in the mid-19th century, the inhabitants of many parts of the Hebrides were devastated by the Clearances, which destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms.Hunter (2000) p. 212 The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands' kelp industry that thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815Hunter (2000) pp. 247, 262Duncan, P.

Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150 AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of , writes that there are five ' (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and '.Breeze, David J. \"The ancient geography of Scotland\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13Watson (1926) pp. 40–41Watson (1994) p. 38 Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as , use the forms ' and '.Louis Deroy & Marianne Mulon (1992) ', Paris: Le Robert, article \"Hébrides\"\n\nThe name ' recorded by Ptolemy may be pre-Celtic.

Watson (1926) also notes the possible relationship between ' and the ancient Irish Ulaid tribal name ' and the personal name of a king  recorded in the '.\n\nThe names of other individual islands reflect their complex linguistic history. The majority are Norse or Gaelic but the roots of several other Hebrides may have a pre-Celtic origin. Adomnán, the 7th century abbot of Iona, records Colonsay as Colosus and Tiree as Ethica, both of which may be pre-Celtic names.Watson (1994) p. 85-86 The etymology of Skye is complex and may also include a pre-Celtic root. Lewis is ' in Old Norse and although various suggestions have been made as to a Norse meaning (such as \"song house\") (2003) p. 80 the name is not of Gaelic origin and the Norse credentials are questionable.\n\nThe earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken by Donald Monro in 1549, which in some cases also provides the earliest written form of the island name. The derivations of all of the inhabited islands of the Hebrides and some of the larger uninhabited ones are listed below.\n\nOuter Hebrides \n\nLewis and Harris is the largest island in Scotland and the third largest in the British Isles, after Great Britain and Ireland.Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 262. It incorporates Lewis in the north and Harris in the south, both of which are frequently referred to as individual islands, although they are joined by a land border. Remarkably, the island does not have a common name in either English or Gaelic and is referred to as \"Lewis and Harris\", \"Lewis with Harris\", \"Harris with Lewis\" etc. For this reason it is treated as two separate islands below.Thompson (1968) p. 13. The derivation of Lewis may be pre-Celtic (see above) and the origin of Harris is no less problematic. In the Ravenna Cosmography, Erimon may refer to Harris (or possibly the Outer Hebrides as a whole). This word may derive from the  ( \"desert\".Megaw, J.V. S. and SIMPSON, D.A. (1960) \"[http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS.../94_062_078.pdf A short cist burial on North Uist and some notes on the prehistory of the Outer Isles in the second millennium BC\"] (pdf) p. 72 Proc Soc Antiq Scot. archaeologydataservice.ac.uk. Retrieved 13 February 2011. The origin of Uist () is similarly unclear.\n\nInner Hebrides \n\nThere are various examples of Inner Hebridean island names that were originally Gaelic but have become completely replaced. For example, Adomnán records Sainea, Elena, Ommon and Oideacha in the Inner Hebrides, which names must have passed out of usage in the Norse era and whose locations are not clear.Watson (1994) p. 93 One of the complexities is that an island may have had a Celtic name, which was replaced by a similar-sounding Norse name, but then reverted to an essentially Gaelic name with a Norse \"øy\" or \"ey\" ending.Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 482, 486 See for example Rona below.\n\nUninhabited islands \n\nThe names of uninhabited islands follow the same general patterns as the inhabited islands. The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their outliers.\n\nThe etymology of St Kilda, a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides, and its main island Hirta, is very complex. No saint is known by the name of Kilda, and various theories have been proposed for the word's origin, which dates from the late 16th century.Buchanan (1983) Pages 2–6. Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name \"St Kilda\" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse ' (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring ' was dedicated to a saint. (' is a tautological placename, consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well, i.e. \"well well\").Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 314–25.

Sydney, Nova Scotia: Cape Breton UP, 2014.—which long pre-dates the use of \"St Kilda\", is similarly open to interpretation. Watson (1926) offers the Old Irish ', a word meaning \"death\", possibly relating to the dangerous seas.Watson (1994) p. 97 Maclean (1977), drawing on an Icelandic saga describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of ', speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a stag, ' being \"stags\" in Norse.Maclean (1977) page 33.\n\nThe etymology of small islands may be no less complex. In relation to , R. L. Stevenson believed that \"black and dismal\" was a translation of the name, noting that \"as usual, in Gaelic, it is not the only one.\"Stevenson (1872) p. 10.\n\nNatural history\n\nIn some respects the Hebrides lack biodiversity in comparison to mainland Britain; for example, there are only half as many mammalian species.Murray (1973) p. 72 However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets.[http://www.kilda.org.uk/frame2.htm \"Seabirds\"] .
