They have been selected for their influence on Deism, or for their fame in other areas.\n\n* Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), sixteenth president of the United States of America. He never joined any church and has been described as a \"Christian deist\". As a young man, he was religiously skeptical and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. During his early years, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of deists such as Thomas Paine and Voltaire. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it. After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private. James Adams labelled Lincoln as a deist. In 1834, he reportedly wrote a manuscript essay challenging orthodox Christianity modelled on Paine's book The Age of Reason, which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule.
