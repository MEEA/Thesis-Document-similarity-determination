  "textBody" : "A googolplex is the number 10, or equivalently, 10. Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10100 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1920, Edward Kasner's nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, coined the term googol, which is 10, then proposed the further term googolplex to be \"one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired\". (retrieved March 17, 2015) Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition \"but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer\".Edward Kasner & James R. Newman (1940) Mathematics and the Imagination, page 23, NY: Simon & Schuster It thus became standardized to 10.\n\nSize\n\nA typical book can be printed with 10 zeros (around 400 pages with 50 lines per page and 50 zeros per line). Therefore, it requires 10 such books to print all the zeros of a googolplex (that is, printing a googol of zeros). If each book had a mass of 100 grams, all of them would have a total mass of 10 kilograms. In comparison, Earth's mass is 5.972 x 10 kilograms, and the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated at 2.5 x 10 kilograms.\n\nIn pure mathematics \n\nIn pure mathematics, there are several notational methods for representing large numbers by which the magnitude of a googolplex could be represented, such as tetration, hyperoperation, Knuth's up-arrow notation, Steinhaus–Moser notation, or Conway chained arrow notation.\n\nIn the physical universe\n\nIn the PBS science program Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Episode 9: \"The Lives of the Stars\", astronomer and television personality Carl Sagan estimated that writing a googolplex in full decimal form (i.e., \"10,000,000,000...\") would be physically impossible, since doing so would require more space than is available in the known universe.\n\nOne googol is presumed to be greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which has been estimated to be approximately 1078.. Thus, in the physical world, it is difficult to give examples of numbers that compare to the vastly greater googolplex. However, in analyzing quantum states and black holes, physicist Don Page writes that \"determining experimentally whether or not information is lost down black holes of solar mass ... would require more than 10 measurements to give a rough determination of the final density matrix after a black hole evaporates\".[https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9411193 Page, Don N., \"Information Loss in Black Holes and/or Conscious Beings?\"], 25 Nov. 1994, for publication in Heat Kernel Techniques and Quantum Gravity, S.
