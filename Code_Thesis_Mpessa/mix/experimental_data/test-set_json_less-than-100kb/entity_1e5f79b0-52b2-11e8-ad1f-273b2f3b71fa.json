  "textBody" : "Jonathan Bruce Postel (; August 6, 1943 – October 16, 1998) was an American computer scientist who made many significant contributions to the development of the Internet, particularly with respect to standards. He is known principally for being the Editor of the Request for Comment (RFC) document series, for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and for administering the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) until his death. In his lifetime he was known as   the \"god   of the Internet\" for his comprehensive influence on the medium.\n\nThe Internet Society's Postel Award is named in his honor, as is the Postel Center at Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California. His obituary was written by Vint Cerf and published as RFC 2468 in remembrance of Postel and his work. In 2012, Postel was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.[http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/year/2012 2012 Inductees], Internet Hall of Fame website. Last accessed April 24, 2012 The Channel Islands' Domain Registry building was named after him in early 2016.https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/gg.html>https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/je.html\n\nCareer\n\nPostel attended Van Nuys High School, and then UCLA where he earned his B.S. (1966) as well as his M.A. (1968) in Engineering.  He then went on to complete his Ph.D. there in Computer Science in 1974, with Dave Farber as his thesis advisor.\n\nPostel started work at UCLA on 23 December 1969 as a Postgraduate Research Engineer (I) where he was involved in early work on the ARPANET. He worked there until 24 August 1973 when he left to join MITRE Corporation. He  assisted with Network Information Center which was being set up at SRI by Elizabeth Feinler.  In March 1977, he joined the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California as an Assistant Professor.\n\nPostel was the RFC Editor from 1969 until his death, and wrote and edited many important RFCs, including RFC 791, RFC 792 and RFC 793, which define the basic protocols of the Internet protocol suite, and RFC 2223, Instructions to RFC Authors. Between 1982 and 1984 Postel co-authored the RFCs which became the foundation of today's DNS (RFC 819, RFC 881, RFC 882 and RFC 920) which were joined in 1995 by RFC 1591 which he also co-wrote.\nIn total, he wrote or co-authored more than 200 RFCs.\n\nPostel served on the Internet Architecture Board and its predecessors for many years. He was the Director of the names and number assignment clearinghouse, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), from its inception. He was the first member of the Internet Society, and was on its Board of Trustees. He was the original and long-time .us Top-Level Domain administrator. He also managed the Los Nettos Network.\n\nAll of the above were part-time activities he assumed in conjunction with his primary position as Director of the Computer Networks Division (\"Division 7\") of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.[http://www.isi.edu/div7/people/postel.home/ Jon Postel Home page] .

Domain Name Handbook.\n\nDNS Root Authority test, U.S. response\n\nOn January 28, 1998, Postel, as a test, emailed eight of the twelve operators of Internet's regional root nameservers on his own authority and instructed them to change the root zone server from then SAIC subsidiary Network Solutions (NSI)'s A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (198.41.0.4) to IANA's DNSROOT.IANA.ORG (198.32.1.98). The operators complied with Postel's instructions, thus dividing control of Internet naming between the non-government operators with IANA and the 4 remaining U.S. Government roots at NASA, DoD, and BRL with NSI.  Though usage of the Internet was not interrupted, he soon received  orders from senior government officials to undo this change, which he did.  Within a week, the US NTIA issued A proposal to improve technical management of Internet names and addresses, including changes to authority over the Internet DNS root zone, which ultimately, and controversially, (cited 50 Duke L. J. 17 (2000)) increased U.S. control.\n\nLegacy\n\nOn October 16, 1998, Postel died of complications from heart surgery in Los Angeles, nine months after the DNS Root Authority incident. He was recovering from a surgery to replace a leaking heart valve.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/10/18/jon-postel-internet-pioneer-dies-at-55-after-heart-surgery/75b75d28-95c1-4a6b-9a0b-2b7f08533fbc/ Jon Postel, Internet Pioneer, Dies at 55 after Heart Surgery].
