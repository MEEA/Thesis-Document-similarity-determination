The latter excludes Adélie Land, where French sovereignty is not widely recognized. \n\nThe territory has no permanent civilian population.\"The TAAF do not have any permanent population.\"  Those resident consist of visiting military personnel, officials, scientific researchers and support staff.\n\nAdministration \n\nThe French Southern and Antarctic Lands have formed a ' (an overseas territory) of France since 1955. Formerly, they were administered from Paris by an ' assisted by a secretary-general; since December 2004, however, their administrator has been a préfet, currently Cécile Pozzo di Borgo, with headquarters in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.\n\nThe territory is divided into five districts:\n\n a According to new law 2007-224 of February 21, 2007, the Scattered Islands constitute the TAAF's fifth district.

The headquarters of the district chief lies beyond the TAAF, in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.c The Territory's principal station is Martin-de-Viviès on Île Amsterdam. The capital and headquarters of the Territorial administrator lies beyond the TAAF, in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.\n\nEach district is headed by a district chief, who has powers similar to those of a French mayor (including recording births and deaths and being an officer of judicial police).\n\nBecause there is no permanent population, there is no elected assembly, nor does the territory send representatives to the national parliament.\n\nDistricts as per new proposal \n\nThese are the districts per new proposal:\n# Kerguelen Islands\n# Crozet Islands\n# Amsterdam Island\n# Saint Paul Island\n# Tromelin Island\n# Glorioso Islands\n# Banc du Geyser\n# Juan de Nova Island\n# Bassas da India\n# Europa Island\n# Adélie Land (French Antarctica)\n\nGeography \n\nThe territory includes Île Amsterdam, Île Saint-Paul, Îles Crozet and Îles Kerguelen in the southern Indian Ocean near 43°S, 67°E, along with Adélie Land, the sector of Antarctica claimed by France, named by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville after his wife.\n\nAdélie Land (about 432000 km2) and the islands, totaling 7781 km2, have no indigenous inhabitants, though in 1997 there were about 100 researchers whose numbers varied from winter (July) to summer (January).\n\nÎle Amsterdam and Île Saint-Paul are extinct volcanoes and have been delineated as the Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands ecoregion. The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Île Kerguelen at 1850 m.
