  "textBody" : "Enniskillen (, ) is a town and civil parish in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It is located almost exactly in the centre of the county, between the Upper and Lower sections of Lough Erne. It had a population of 13,823 in the 2011 census. It was the seat of local government for the former Fermanagh District Council, and is the county town of Fermanagh as well as its largest town.\n\nHistory\n\nThe town's name comes from the . This refers to Cethlenn, a figure in Irish mythology who may have been a goddess. Local legend has it that Cethlenn was wounded in battle by an arrow and attempted to swim across the River Erne, which surrounds the island, but she never reached the other side, so the island was named in reference to her. It has been anglicised many ways over the centuries – Iniskellen, Iniskellin, Iniskillin, Iniskillen, Inishkellen, Inishkellin, Inishkillin, Inishkillen and so on.\n\nThe town's oldest building is Enniskillen Castle, built by Hugh (Maguire) the Hospitable who died in 1428. An earthwork, the Skonce on the shore of Lough Erne, may be the remains of an earlier motte. The castle was the stronghold of the junior branch of the Maguires. The first watergate was built around 1580 by Cú Chonnacht Maguire, though subsequent lowering of the level of the lough has left it without water. The strategic position of the castle made its capture important for the English in 1593, to support their plans for the control of Ulster; this was achieved by a Captain Dowdall in February 1594. Maguire then laid siege to it, and defeated a relieving force at the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits at Drumane Bridge on the Arney River. Although the defenders were relieved, Maguire gained possession of the castle from 1595 to 1598 and it was not finally captured by the English until 1607.\n\nThis was part of a wider campaign to bring the province of Ulster under English control; the final capture of Enniskillen Castle in 1607 was followed by the Plantation of Ulster, during which the lands of the native Irish were seized and handed over to planters loyal to the English Crown. The Maguires were supplanted by William Cole, originally from Devon, who was appointed by James I to build an English settlement there.\n\nCaptain Cole was installed as Constable and strengthened the castle wall and built a \"fair house\" on the old foundation as the centrepoint of the county town. The first Protestant parish church was erected on the hilltop in 1627. The Royal Free School of Fermanagh was moved onto the island in 1643. The first bridges were drawbridges; permanent bridges were not installed before 1688.\n\nBy 1689 the town had grown significantly. During the conflict which resulted from the ousting of King James II by his Protestant rival, William III, Enniskillen and Derry were the focus of Williamite resistance in Ireland, including the nearby Battle of Newtownbutler.Witherow, Thomas. [http://www.libraryireland.com/Derry1689/VI-1.php \"The Defence of Enniskillen\"]. Derry and Enniskillen in the Year 1689. Library Ireland. Retrieved 24 May 2012.\n\nEnniskillen and Derry were the two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James II, and it was the last town to fall before the siege of Derry. As a direct result of this conflict, Enniskillen developed not only as a market town but also as a garrison, which became home to two regiments.\n\nThe current site of Fermanagh College (now part of the South West College) was the former Enniskillen Gaol.  Many people were tried and hanged in the square during the times of public execution. Part of the old Gaol is still used by the college.\n\nMilitary history\n\nEnniskillen is the site of the foundation of two British Army regiments:\n*Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers\n*The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons)\n\nThe town's name (with the archaic spelling) continues to form part of the title to The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment).\n\nThe Troubles\n\nEnniskillen was the site of several events during The Troubles, the most notable being the Remembrance Day bombing in which 11 people were killed. Bill Clinton opened the Clinton centre in 2002 on the site of the bombing. The Provisional Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe Irish singer/songwriter Tommy Makem wrote a lighthearted song about the town, covered by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem and The Dubliners.\n\nThe Chieftains sing a song that mentions Enniskillen titled \"North Amerikay\".\n\nJim Kerr of Simple Minds was so moved by the results of the Enniskillen bombing in 1987 that he wrote new words to the traditional folk song \"She Moved Through The Fair\" and the group recorded it with the name \"Belfast Child\". The recording reached No. 1 in the UK Charts, Ireland and several other countries in 1989. The single was taken from the album Street Fighting Years; the single version was also published with the title \"Ballad of the Streets\". The video to the song was shot in black and white and displays poignant footage of children and the destruction of the bombing.  Similarly, U2 held a concert the same day of the bombing, which was being filmed for a movie.  During a performance of their song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", singer Bono passionately condemned the bombing, stating \"fuck the revolution\" in his mid-song speech. The footage is included in U2's rockumentary Rattle and Hum.\n\nThe Irish language novel Mo Dhá Mhicí by Séamus Mac Annaidh is set in Enniskillen.\n\nDemography\n\nEnniskillen is classified as a \"medium town\" by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 10,000 and 18,000 people). On census day in 2011, there were 13,823 people living in Enniskillen.
