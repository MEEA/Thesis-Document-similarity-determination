Semitic Mem is most likely derived from a \"Proto-Sinaitic\"  (Bronze Age) adoption of the  \"water\" ideogram in Egyptian writing. The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value, from the Egyptian word for \"water\", nt; the adoption as the Semitic letter for was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the Semitic word for \"water\", *mƒÅ(y)-.See F.
