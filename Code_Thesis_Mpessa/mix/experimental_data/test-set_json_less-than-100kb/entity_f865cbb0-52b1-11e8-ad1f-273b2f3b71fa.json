  "textBody" : "Foonly was a short-lived American computer company formed by Dave Poole, one of the principal Super Foonly designers as well as one of hackerdom's more colourful personalities. The company produced a series of DEC PDP-10 compatible computers, first the high-performance F-1, and later a series of smaller and less expensive designs. The first Foonly machine, the F-1, was the computational engine used to create some of the graphics in the 1982 film Tron.\n\nPDP-10 successor\n\nThe PDP-10 successor was to have been built by the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) along with a new operating system. The intention was to leapfrog from the old DEC timesharing system which SAIL was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX – at that time the ARPANET standard. The F-1 was the fastest PDP-10 architecture machine ever built, with a clock rate of 90-100 ns per cycle, but only one was ever made. ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the new operating system was cut in 1974. The design for Foonly contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.\n\nHistory\n\nThe following few paragraphs are a personal account of the events, by Dave Dyer:\n\nFoonly Inc. did not acquire any financial resources as a result of building the F-1. They turned to the market for low-end machines, producing a series of smaller, slower, and much less expensive DEC-10 clones that ran a TENEX variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market. Also, the machines shipped as wire-wrapped engineering prototypes requiring individual attention from more than usually competent site personnel, and thus had significant reliability problems. Poole's legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help matters. By the time of DEC's Jupiter project cancellation in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was eclipsed by another DEC-10 clone, the Mars computer, and the company never quite recovered.\nAdded by Phil Petit, (one of the above-mentioned Foonly designers):\n\nAdded by Dan Martin - Principal Engineer for Tymshare Inc.\n\nAdded by Vance Socci - Scientist/Principal Engineer, TYMCOM-X group Tymshare Inc.:Dave Poole's first technical interface for selling the F2 to us at Tymshare, in the 1979-80 timeframe, was my manager Allen Ginzberg.  We intended to use the converted F2, called the \"F3\", as a replacement for the very expensive to buy and maintain KL-10 systems. It was specifically conceived of to be a \"MAGNUM engine\", intended to run Tymshare's groundbreaking relational database system under the TYMCOM-X OS.   At first, it was my job to port the TYMCOM-X OS to the F3, a job which I had performed once before at Tymshare for the KI-10 to KL-10 port, and had also performed at DEC in Marlboro, Mass for TOPS-10 (after Tony Wachs was in a terrible car crash in his 240/Z).  However, we needed the full KL-10/KI-10 instruction set, and Foonly had only implemented the KA-10's instructions.  Dave, sadly to say, \"didn't suffer fools lightly\" , and I was no exception, despite the fact that I was a customer. However, when one of the Foonly engineers burned out trying to finish off the 2901 tape controller firmware, arithmetic trap instructions, high precision integer instructions, KL-10 style paging, and ADJBP (adjust byte pointer), he was at a standstill.  Allen suggested to Dave that I try my hand at finished the microcode.  Dave, faced with no alternatives, very reluctantly agreed.I finished off the microcode successfully and brought the system up on Tymnet.  I can't recall if we ever put it into timesharing service, but I believe we did.  I left Tymshare not too long afterwards, so the rest of the history must be left for someone else to tell.And yes, Dave and I became friends, and I was no longer a fool to be suffered - and yes, he did bring his parrot to work sometimes in his little VW bug!\n\nThe main application for Tymshare's version of the F4 was a version of Doug Englebart's NLS system, developed when his team moved to Tymshare from SRI, called \"Augment\". The machine, called the 26KL, was marketed as the \"Augment Engine\" when running Augment.\n\nOctober 6, 2015\n\nAdded by Paul Milleson - Principal Manager, Foonly Inc.",
