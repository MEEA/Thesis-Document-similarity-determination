The government takes one and gives it to your neighbour.\n*Communism: You have two cows. You give them to the government, and the government then gives you some milk.\n*Fascism: You have two cows. You give them to the government, and the government then sells you some milk.\n*Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.\n*Nazism: You have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.\n\nBill Sherk mentions that such lists circulated throughout the United States since around 1936 under the title \"Parable of the Isms\".\"500 Years of New Words\", by Bill Sherk, Doubleday, 1983, , p. 162.

Satirising the satire, he appended this comment to capitalism: \"...Then put both of them in your wife's name and declare bankruptcy.\" This material was later used as an element of his satirical US presidential campaign in 1968, and was included on his 1968 comedy album Pat Paulsen for President.\n\nRichard M Steers and Luciara Nardon in their book about global economy use the \"two cows\" metaphor to illustrate the concept of cultural differences.
