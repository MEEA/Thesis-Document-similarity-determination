  "textBody" : "The foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia since its independence in 1991 have been characterized by the country's efforts to gain membership in international organizations such as NATO and the European Union and to gain international recognition under its constitutional name, overshadowed by a long-standing, dead-locked dispute with neighboring Greece. Greek objections to the country's name have led to it being admitted to the United Nations and several other international fora only under the provisional designation Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n\nInternational recognition\n\nMacedonia became a member state of the United Nations on April 8, 1993, eighteen months after its independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is referred within the UN as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", pending a resolution, to the long-running dispute about the country's name.

A number of countries recognise the country by its constitutional name – the Republic of Macedonia – rather than the UN reference, notably four of the five permanent UN Security Council members (the UK, the United States, Russia, and the People's Republic of China) and over 130 other UN members.[http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?vId68382988&lId\n2 MIA]  Kosovo is the 127th country that Macedonia has established diplomatic ties with under its constitutional name.\n\nList of countries and entities recognising the country and establishing diplomatic relations\n\n* [http://www.macedonianembassy.org/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id50%3Abilateral-relations&catid\n50%3Abilateral-relations&Itemid81&lang\nen][https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040551/http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=310] (see the map above)\n* European Union (EU)[http://www.macedonianembassy.org/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id50%3Abilateral-relations&catid\n50%3Abilateral-relations&Itemid81&lang\nen ЕSTABLISHED FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA]: \"The Republic of Macedonia established diplomatic relations with the European Union on the 29-th of December 1995.\"\n* Sovereign Military Order of Malta [https://web.archive.org/web/20151203000000/http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en]\n\nList of countries and entities with no formal diplomatic relations with the country\n\n* Georgia, San Marino.\n* Lebanon.\n* Bhutan, South Korea.\n* Liberia, Mali, South Sudan, Tunisia.\n* The Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago.\n* Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga\n* State of Palestine, and the rest of states with limited recognition\n\nBilateral relations\n\nAfrica\n\nAmericas\n\nAsia\n\nEurope\n\nOceania\n\nIssues\n\nFlag issue\n\nMacedonia's first post-independence flag caused a major controversy when it was unveiled.

The Greek viewpoint was summed up in an FAQ circulated on the Internet in the late 1990s:\n\nThe Vergina Sun, the emblem of Philip's dynasty, symbolizes the birth of our nation. It was the first time (4th century BC) that the Greek mainland (city-states and kingdoms) with the same language, culture, and religion were united against the enemies of Asia in one league.

It read:\n\n(1) The Republic cares for the status and rights of those persons belonging to the Macedonian people in neighboring countries, as well as Macedonian expatriates, assists their cultural development and promotes links with them.
