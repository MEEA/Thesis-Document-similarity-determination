A restricted form of the theorem was proved by Rolle in 1691; the result was what is now known as Rolle's theorem, and was proved only for polynomials, without the techniques of calculus.

If finite, that limit equals f'(x) . An example where this version of the theorem applies is given by the real-valued cube root function mapping x \\to x^\\frac13 , whose derivative tends to infinity at the origin.\n\nNote that the theorem, as stated, is false if a differentiable function is complex-valued instead of real-valued. For example, define f(x)=e^{xi} for all real x . Then\nf(2\\pi)-f(0)0\n0(2\\pi-0)\nwhile f'(x)\\ne 0 for any real x .\n\nProof\n\nThe expression \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} gives the slope of the line joining the points (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) , which is a chord of the graph of f , while f'(x) gives the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point (x,f(x)) . Thus the Mean value theorem says that given any chord of a smooth curve, we can find a point lying between the end-points of the chord such that the tangent at that point is parallel to the chord. The following proof illustrates this idea.\n\nDefine g(x)=f(x)-rx , where r is a constant. Since f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b) , the same is true for g . We now want to choose r so that g satisfies the conditions of Rolle's theorem.

If the derivative of f at every interior point of the interval I exists and is zero, then f is constant in the interior.\n\nProof: Assume the derivative of f at every interior point of the interval I exists and is zero. Let (a, b) be an arbitrary open interval in I. By the mean value theorem, there exists a point c in (a,b) such that\n\n0f'(c)\n\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\n\nThis implies that f(a) = f(b). Thus, f is constant on the interior of I and thus is constant on I by continuity. (See below for a multivariable version of this result.)\n\nRemarks: \n* Only continuity of f, not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval I.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if I is an open interval, since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.  (See the section continuity and differentiability of the article derivative.)\n* The differentiability of f can be relaxed to one-sided differentiability, a proof given in the article on semi-differentiability.\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem, also known as the extended mean value theorem, is a generalization of the mean value theorem. It states: If functions f and g are both continuous on the closed interval [a, b], and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c ∈ (a, b), such that\n\n(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c).\n\nOf course, if  and if , this is equivalent to:\n\n\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\n\nGeometrically, this means that there is some tangent to the graph of the curve\n\n\\begin{cases}[a,b] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2\\\\t\\mapsto (f(t),g(t))\\end{cases}\n\nwhich is parallel to the line defined by the points (f(a), g(a)) and (f(b), g(b)). However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (f(a), g(a)) and (f(b), g(b)) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value c with , in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is stationary; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by\n\nt\\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),\n\nwhich on the interval [−1, 1] goes from the point (−1, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a cusp) at .\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove l'Hôpital's rule. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when .\n\nProof of Cauchy's mean value theorem\n\nThe proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.\n\n* Suppose g(a) ≠ g(b). Define h(x) f(x) − rg(x), where r is fixed in such a way that h(a) \n h(b), namely\n: \\begin{align}h(a)h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)\nf(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r\n\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}\nSince f and g are continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), the same is true for h. All in all, h satisfies the conditions of Rolle's theorem: consequently, there is some c in (a, b) for which h′(c) = 0. Now using the definition of h we have:\n:0h'(c)\nf'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).\nTherefore:\n:f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),\nwhich implies the result.\n\n* If g(a) g(b), then, applying Rolle's theorem to g, it follows that there exists c in (a, b) for which g′(c) \n 0. Using this choice of c, Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\nGeneralization for determinants\n\nAssume that f, g, and h are differentiable functions on (a,b) that are continuous on [a,b]. Define\n\n D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|\n\nThere exists c\\in(a,b) such that  D'(c)=0.\n\nNotice that\n D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|\nand if we place h(x)1, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place h(x)\n1 and g(x)=x we get Lagrange's mean value theorem.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of D(a) and D(b) are determinants with two identical rows, hence D(a)D(b)\n0. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists c\\in (a,b) such that D'(c)=0.\n\nMean value theorem in several variables \n\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet G be an open convex subset of \\R^n , and let f:G\\to\\R be a differentiable function. Fix points x,y\\in G , and define g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big) . Since g is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\ng(1)-g(0)=g'(c)\n\nfor some c between 0 and 1. But since g(1)f(y) and g(0)\nf(x) , computing g'(c) explicitly we have:\n\nf(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)\n\nwhere \\nabla denotes a gradient and \\cdot a dot product. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case n=1 this is the theorem in one variable). By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the equation gives the estimate:\n\n\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of f are bounded, f is Lipschitz continuous (and therefore uniformly continuous). Note that f is not assumed to be continuously differentiable nor continuous on the closure of G . However, in the above, we used the chain rule so the existence of \\nabla f would not be sufficient.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that f is constant if G is open and connected and every partial derivative of f is 0. Pick some point x_0\\in G , and let g(x)f(x)-f(x_0) . We want to show g(x)\n0 for every x\\in G . For that, let E\\{x\\in G:g(x)\n0\\} . Then E is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every x\\in E ,\n\n\\Big|g(y)\\Big|\\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\\Bigg|\\le (0)\\Big|y-x\\Big|\n0\n\nfor every y in some neighborhood of x . (Here, it is crucial that x and y are sufficiently close to each other.) Since G is connected, we conclude E=G .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when G is a subset of a Banach space.\n\nMean value theorem for vector-valued functions \n\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Rudin gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:\n\nTheorem.  For a continuous vector-valued function \\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k differentiable on (a,b), there exists x\\in(a,b) such that |\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| .\n\nJean Dieudonné in his classic treatise Foundations of Modern Analysis discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. Serge Lang in Analysis I uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the Henstock–Kurzweil integral one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If f : U → Rm is a differentiable function (where U ⊂ Rn is open) and if x + th, x, h ∈ Rn, t ∈ [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside U), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions fi (i 1, ..., m) of f (in the above notation set y \n x + h). In doing so one finds points x + tih on the line segment satisfying\n\nf_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.\n\nBut generally there will not be a single point x + t*h on the line segment satisfying\n\nf_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.\n\nfor all i simultaneously. For example, define:\n\n\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}\n\nThen f(2\\pi) - f(0) \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2, but f_1'(x)\n-\\sin (x) and f_2'(x)=\\cos (x) are never simultaneously zero as x ranges over \\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right].\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let f be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval I, and let x as well as x + h be points of I. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some t* between 0 and 1 such that\n\nf(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the fundamental theorem of calculus followed by a change of variables,\n\n f(x+h)-f(x) \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du \n \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.\n\nThus, the value f′(x + t*h) at the particular point t* has been replaced by the mean value\n\n\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\nLemma 1. Let U ⊂ Rn be open, f : U → Rm continuously differentiable, and x ∈ U, h ∈ Rn vectors such that the line segment x + th,  0 ≤ t ≤ 1 remains in U. Then we have:\n:f(x+h)-f(x) = \\left (\\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h,\nwhere Df denotes the Jacobian matrix of f and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.\n\nProof. Let f1, ..., fm denote the components of f and define:\n\n\\begin{cases} g_i : [0,1] \\to \\mathbf{R} \\\\ g_i(t) = f_i (x +th) \\end{cases} \n\nThen we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n& f_i(x+h)-f_i(x) g_i(1)-g_i(0) \n\\int_0^1 g_i'(t)\\,dt \\\\\n{} & \\int_0^1 \\left (\\sum_{j\n1}^n \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j} (x+th)h_j\\right)\\,dt \\sum_{j\n1}^n \\left (\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}(x+th)\\,dt\\right)h_j.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe claim follows since Df is the matrix consisting of the components \\tfrac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}.\n\nLemma 2. Let v : [a, b] → Rm be a continuous function defined on the interval [a, b] ⊂ R. Then we have\n:\\left \\|\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt\\right\\|\\leqslant \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt.\n\nProof. Let u in Rm denote the value of the integral\nu:=\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt.\nNow we have (using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality):\n\\|u\\|^2 \\langle u,u \\rangle \n\\left \\langle \\int_a^b v(t) \\, dt, u \\right\\rangle \\int_a^b \\langle v(t),u \\rangle \\,dt \\leqslant \\int_a^b \\| v(t) \\|\\cdot \\|u \\|\\,dt \n \\|u\\| \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt\nNow cancelling the norm of u from both ends gives us the desired inequality.\n\nMean Value Inequality. If the norm of Df(x + th) is bounded by some constant M for t in [0, 1], then\n:\\|f(x+h)-f(x)\\| \\leqslant M\\|h\\|.\n\nProof. From Lemma 1 and 2  it follows that\n\\|f(x+h)-f(x)\\|=\\left \\|\\int_0^1 (Df(x+th)\\cdot h)\\,dt\\right\\|  \\leqslant \\int_0^1 \\|Df(x+th)\\| \\cdot \\|h\\|\\, dt \\leqslant M\\| h\\|.\n\nMean value theorems for definite integrals \n\nFirst mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nLet f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function. Then there exists c in (a, b) such that\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = f(c)(b - a).\n\nSince the mean value of f on [a, b] is defined as\n\n\\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx,\n\nwe can interpret the conclusion as f achieves its mean value at some c in (a, b).\n\nIn general, if f : [a, b] → R is continuous and g is an integrable function that does not change sign on [a, b], then there exists c in (a, b) such that\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \\, dx = f(c) \\int_a^b  g(x) \\, dx.\n\nProof of the first mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nSuppose f : [a, b] → R is continuous and g is a nonnegative integrable function on [a, b]. By the extreme value theorem, there exists m and M such that for each x in [a, b], m\\leqslant  f(x) \\leqslant  M  and f[a,b] = [m, M]. Since g is nonnegative,\n\nm \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  \\int^b_a f(x)g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  M \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx.\n\nNow let\n\nI = \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx.\n\nIf I = 0, we're done since\n\n0 \\leqslant  \\int_a^b f(x) g(x)\\, dx \\leqslant  0\n\nmeans\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\, dx=0,\n\nso for any c in (a, b),\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\, dx f(c) I \n 0.\n\nIf I ≠ 0, then\n\nm \\leqslant  \\frac1I \\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\,dx \\leqslant  M.\n\nBy the intermediate value theorem, f attains every value of the interval [m, M], so for some c in [a, b]\n\nf(c) = \\frac1I\\int^b_a f(x) g(x) \\, dx,\n\nthat is,\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \\, dx = f(c) \\int_a^b  g(x) \\, dx.\n\nFinally, if g is negative on [a, b], then\n\nM \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  \\int^b_a f(x)g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  m \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx,\n\nand we still get the same result as above.\n\nQED\n\nSecond mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nThere are various slightly different theorems called the second mean value theorem for definite integrals.  A commonly found version is as follows:\n\nIf G : [a, b] → R is a positive monotonically decreasing function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b] such that\n: \\int_a^b G(t)\\varphi(t)\\,dt = G(a^+) \\int_a^x \\varphi(t)\\,dt. \n\nHere G(a^+) stands for {\\lim_{x\\to a^+}G(x)}, the existence of which follows from the conditions. Note that it is essential that the interval (a, b] contains b. A variant not having this requirement is:\n\nIf G : [a, b] → R is a monotonic (not necessarily decreasing and positive) function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b) such that\n: \\int_a^b G(t)\\varphi(t)\\,dt = G(a^+) \\int_a^x \\varphi(t)\\,dt + G(b^-) \\int_x^b \\varphi(t)\\,dt. \n\nMean value theorem for integration fails for vector-valued functions \n\nIf the function G returns a multi-dimensional vector, then the MVT for integration is not true, even if the domain of G is also multi-dimensional.\n\nFor example, consider the following 2-dimensional function defined on an n-dimensional cube:\n\n\\begin{cases} G: [0,2\\pi]^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\ G(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)=\\left (\\sin(x_1+\\cdots+x_n), \\cos(x_1+\\cdots+x_n)\\right)\\end{cases} \n\nThen, by symmetry it is easy to see that the mean value of G over its domain is (0,0):\n\n\\int_{[0,2\\pi]^n} G(x_1,\\cdots,x_n) dx_1 \\cdots dx_n = (0,0)\n\nHowever, there is no point in which G(0,0), because |G|\n1 everywhere.\n\nA probabilistic analogue of the mean value theorem\n\nLet X and Y be non-negative random variables such that E[X] X\\leqslant_{st} Y (i.e. X is smaller than Y in the usual stochastic order).  Then there exists an absolutely continuous non-negative random variable Z having probability density function\n\n f_Z(x)={\\Pr(Y>x)-\\Pr(X>x)\\over {\\rm E}[Y]-{\\rm E}[X]}\\,, \\qquad x\\geqslant 0.\n\nLet g be a measurable and differentiable function such that E[g(X)], E[g(Y)] \n\n {\\rm E}[g(Y)]-{\\rm E}[g(X)]={\\rm E}[g'(Z)]\\,[{\\rm E}(Y)-{\\rm E}(X)].\n\nGeneralization in complex analysis \n\nAs noted above, the theorem does not hold for differentiable complex-valued functions. Instead, a generalization of the theorem is stated such:\n\nLet f : Ω → C be a holomorphic function on the open convex set Ω, and let a and b be distinct points in Ω. Then there exist points u, v on Lab (the line segment from a to b) such that\n\\mathrm{Re}(f'(u)) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left ( \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\right),\n\\mathrm{Im}(f'(v)) = \\mathrm{Im}\\left ( \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\right).\n\nWhere Re() is the Real part and Im() is the Imaginary part of a complex-valued function.",

Let (a, b) be an arbitrary open interval in I. By the mean value theorem, there exists a point c in (a,b) such that\n\n0f'(c)\n\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\n\nThis implies that f(a) = f(b). Thus, f is constant on the interior of I and thus is constant on I by continuity. (See below for a multivariable version of this result.)\n\nRemarks: \n* Only continuity of f, not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval I.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if I is an open interval, since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.  (See the section continuity and differentiability of the article derivative.)\n* The differentiability of f can be relaxed to one-sided differentiability, a proof given in the article on semi-differentiability.\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem, also known as the extended mean value theorem, is a generalization of the mean value theorem. It states: If functions f and g are both continuous on the closed interval [a, b], and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c ∈ (a, b), such that\n\n(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c).\n\nOf course, if  and if , this is equivalent to:\n\n\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\n\nGeometrically, this means that there is some tangent to the graph of the curve\n\n\\begin{cases}[a,b] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2\\\\t\\mapsto (f(t),g(t))\\end{cases}\n\nwhich is parallel to the line defined by the points (f(a), g(a)) and (f(b), g(b)). However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (f(a), g(a)) and (f(b), g(b)) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value c with , in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is stationary; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by\n\nt\\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),\n\nwhich on the interval [−1, 1] goes from the point (−1, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a cusp) at .\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove l'Hôpital's rule. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when .\n\nProof of Cauchy's mean value theorem\n\nThe proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.\n\n* Suppose g(a) ≠ g(b). Define h(x) f(x) − rg(x), where r is fixed in such a way that h(a) \n h(b), namely\n: \\begin{align}h(a)h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)\nf(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r\n\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}\nSince f and g are continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), the same is true for h. All in all, h satisfies the conditions of Rolle's theorem: consequently, there is some c in (a, b) for which h′(c) = 0. Now using the definition of h we have:\n:0h'(c)\nf'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).\nTherefore:\n:f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),\nwhich implies the result.\n\n* If g(a) g(b), then, applying Rolle's theorem to g, it follows that there exists c in (a, b) for which g′(c) \n 0. Using this choice of c, Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\nGeneralization for determinants\n\nAssume that f, g, and h are differentiable functions on (a,b) that are continuous on [a,b]. Define\n\n D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|\n\nThere exists c\\in(a,b) such that  D'(c)=0.\n\nNotice that\n D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|\nand if we place h(x)1, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place h(x)\n1 and g(x)=x we get Lagrange's mean value theorem.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of D(a) and D(b) are determinants with two identical rows, hence D(a)D(b)\n0. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists c\\in (a,b) such that D'(c)=0.\n\nMean value theorem in several variables \n\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet G be an open convex subset of \\R^n , and let f:G\\to\\R be a differentiable function. Fix points x,y\\in G , and define g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big) . Since g is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\ng(1)-g(0)=g'(c)\n\nfor some c between 0 and 1. But since g(1)f(y) and g(0)\nf(x) , computing g'(c) explicitly we have:\n\nf(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)\n\nwhere \\nabla denotes a gradient and \\cdot a dot product. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case n=1 this is the theorem in one variable). By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the equation gives the estimate:\n\n\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of f are bounded, f is Lipschitz continuous (and therefore uniformly continuous). Note that f is not assumed to be continuously differentiable nor continuous on the closure of G . However, in the above, we used the chain rule so the existence of \\nabla f would not be sufficient.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that f is constant if G is open and connected and every partial derivative of f is 0. Pick some point x_0\\in G , and let g(x)f(x)-f(x_0) . We want to show g(x)\n0 for every x\\in G . For that, let E\\{x\\in G:g(x)\n0\\} . Then E is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every x\\in E ,\n\n\\Big|g(y)\\Big|\\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\\Bigg|\\le (0)\\Big|y-x\\Big|\n0\n\nfor every y in some neighborhood of x . (Here, it is crucial that x and y are sufficiently close to each other.) Since G is connected, we conclude E=G .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when G is a subset of a Banach space.\n\nMean value theorem for vector-valued functions \n\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Rudin gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:\n\nTheorem.  For a continuous vector-valued function \\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k differentiable on (a,b), there exists x\\in(a,b) such that |\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| .\n\nJean Dieudonné in his classic treatise Foundations of Modern Analysis discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. Serge Lang in Analysis I uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the Henstock–Kurzweil integral one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If f : U → Rm is a differentiable function (where U ⊂ Rn is open) and if x + th, x, h ∈ Rn, t ∈ [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside U), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions fi (i 1, ..., m) of f (in the above notation set y \n x + h). In doing so one finds points x + tih on the line segment satisfying\n\nf_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.\n\nBut generally there will not be a single point x + t*h on the line segment satisfying\n\nf_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.\n\nfor all i simultaneously. For example, define:\n\n\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}\n\nThen f(2\\pi) - f(0) \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2, but f_1'(x)\n-\\sin (x) and f_2'(x)=\\cos (x) are never simultaneously zero as x ranges over \\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right].\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let f be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval I, and let x as well as x + h be points of I. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some t* between 0 and 1 such that\n\nf(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the fundamental theorem of calculus followed by a change of variables,\n\n f(x+h)-f(x) \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du \n \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.\n\nThus, the value f′(x + t*h) at the particular point t* has been replaced by the mean value\n\n\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\nLemma 1. Let U ⊂ Rn be open, f : U → Rm continuously differentiable, and x ∈ U, h ∈ Rn vectors such that the line segment x + th,  0 ≤ t ≤ 1 remains in U. Then we have:\n:f(x+h)-f(x) = \\left (\\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h,\nwhere Df denotes the Jacobian matrix of f and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.\n\nProof. Let f1, ..., fm denote the components of f and define:\n\n\\begin{cases} g_i : [0,1] \\to \\mathbf{R} \\\\ g_i(t) = f_i (x +th) \\end{cases} \n\nThen we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n& f_i(x+h)-f_i(x) g_i(1)-g_i(0) \n\\int_0^1 g_i'(t)\\,dt \\\\\n{} & \\int_0^1 \\left (\\sum_{j\n1}^n \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j} (x+th)h_j\\right)\\,dt \\sum_{j\n1}^n \\left (\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}(x+th)\\,dt\\right)h_j.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe claim follows since Df is the matrix consisting of the components \\tfrac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}.\n\nLemma 2. Let v : [a, b] → Rm be a continuous function defined on the interval [a, b] ⊂ R. Then we have\n:\\left \\|\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt\\right\\|\\leqslant \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt.\n\nProof. Let u in Rm denote the value of the integral\nu:=\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt.\nNow we have (using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality):\n\\|u\\|^2 \\langle u,u \\rangle \n\\left \\langle \\int_a^b v(t) \\, dt, u \\right\\rangle \\int_a^b \\langle v(t),u \\rangle \\,dt \\leqslant \\int_a^b \\| v(t) \\|\\cdot \\|u \\|\\,dt \n \\|u\\| \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt\nNow cancelling the norm of u from both ends gives us the desired inequality.\n\nMean Value Inequality. If the norm of Df(x + th) is bounded by some constant M for t in [0, 1], then\n:\\|f(x+h)-f(x)\\| \\leqslant M\\|h\\|.\n\nProof. From Lemma 1 and 2  it follows that\n\\|f(x+h)-f(x)\\|=\\left \\|\\int_0^1 (Df(x+th)\\cdot h)\\,dt\\right\\|  \\leqslant \\int_0^1 \\|Df(x+th)\\| \\cdot \\|h\\|\\, dt \\leqslant M\\| h\\|.\n\nMean value theorems for definite integrals \n\nFirst mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nLet f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function. Then there exists c in (a, b) such that\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = f(c)(b - a).\n\nSince the mean value of f on [a, b] is defined as\n\n\\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx,\n\nwe can interpret the conclusion as f achieves its mean value at some c in (a, b).\n\nIn general, if f : [a, b] → R is continuous and g is an integrable function that does not change sign on [a, b], then there exists c in (a, b) such that\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \\, dx = f(c) \\int_a^b  g(x) \\, dx.\n\nProof of the first mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nSuppose f : [a, b] → R is continuous and g is a nonnegative integrable function on [a, b]. By the extreme value theorem, there exists m and M such that for each x in [a, b], m\\leqslant  f(x) \\leqslant  M  and f[a,b] = [m, M]. Since g is nonnegative,\n\nm \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  \\int^b_a f(x)g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  M \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx.\n\nNow let\n\nI = \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx.\n\nIf I = 0, we're done since\n\n0 \\leqslant  \\int_a^b f(x) g(x)\\, dx \\leqslant  0\n\nmeans\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\, dx=0,\n\nso for any c in (a, b),\n\n\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\, dx f(c) I \n 0.\n\nIf I ≠ 0, then\n\nm \\leqslant  \\frac1I \\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\\,dx \\leqslant  M.\n\nBy the intermediate value theorem, f attains every value of the interval [m, M], so for some c in [a, b]\n\nf(c) = \\frac1I\\int^b_a f(x) g(x) \\, dx,\n\nthat is,\n\n\\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \\, dx = f(c) \\int_a^b  g(x) \\, dx.\n\nFinally, if g is negative on [a, b], then\n\nM \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  \\int^b_a f(x)g(x) \\, dx \\leqslant  m \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx,\n\nand we still get the same result as above.\n\nQED\n\nSecond mean value theorem for definite integrals\n\nThere are various slightly different theorems called the second mean value theorem for definite integrals.  A commonly found version is as follows:\n\nIf G : [a, b] → R is a positive monotonically decreasing function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b] such that\n: \\int_a^b G(t)\\varphi(t)\\,dt = G(a^+) \\int_a^x \\varphi(t)\\,dt. \n\nHere G(a^+) stands for {\\lim_{x\\to a^+}G(x)}, the existence of which follows from the conditions. Note that it is essential that the interval (a, b] contains b. A variant not having this requirement is:\n\nIf G : [a, b] → R is a monotonic (not necessarily decreasing and positive) function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b) such that\n: \\int_a^b G(t)\\varphi(t)\\,dt = G(a^+) \\int_a^x \\varphi(t)\\,dt + G(b^-) \\int_x^b \\varphi(t)\\,dt. \n\nMean value theorem for integration fails for vector-valued functions \n\nIf the function G returns a multi-dimensional vector, then the MVT for integration is not true, even if the domain of G is also multi-dimensional.\n\nFor example, consider the following 2-dimensional function defined on an n-dimensional cube:\n\n\\begin{cases} G: [0,2\\pi]^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\ G(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)=\\left (\\sin(x_1+\\cdots+x_n), \\cos(x_1+\\cdots+x_n)\\right)\\end{cases} \n\nThen, by symmetry it is easy to see that the mean value of G over its domain is (0,0):\n\n\\int_{[0,2\\pi]^n} G(x_1,\\cdots,x_n) dx_1 \\cdots dx_n = (0,0)\n\nHowever, there is no point in which G(0,0), because |G|\n1 everywhere.\n\nA probabilistic analogue of the mean value theorem\n\nLet X and Y be non-negative random variables such that E[X] X\\leqslant_{st} Y (i.e. X is smaller than Y in the usual stochastic order).  Then there exists an absolutely continuous non-negative random variable Z having probability density function\n\n f_Z(x)={\\Pr(Y>x)-\\Pr(X>x)\\over {\\rm E}[Y]-{\\rm E}[X]}\\,, \\qquad x\\geqslant 0.\n\nLet g be a measurable and differentiable function such that E[g(X)], E[g(Y)] \n\n {\\rm E}[g(Y)]-{\\rm E}[g(X)]={\\rm E}[g'(Z)]\\,[{\\rm E}(Y)-{\\rm E}(X)].\n\nGeneralization in complex analysis \n\nAs noted above, the theorem does not hold for differentiable complex-valued functions. Instead, a generalization of the theorem is stated such:\n\nLet f : Ω → C be a holomorphic function on the open convex set Ω, and let a and b be distinct points in Ω. Then there exist points u, v on Lab (the line segment from a to b) such that\n\\mathrm{Re}(f'(u)) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left ( \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\right),\n\\mathrm{Im}(f'(v)) = \\mathrm{Im}\\left ( \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\right).\n\nWhere Re() is the Real part and Im() is the Imaginary part of a complex-valued function.
