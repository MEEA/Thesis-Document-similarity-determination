  "textBody" : "In mathematics, given two groups, (G, ∗) and (H, ·), a group homomorphism from (G, ∗) to (H, ·) is a function h : G → H such that for all u and v in G it holds that\n h(u*v) = h(u) \\cdot h(v) \n\nwhere the group operation on the left hand side of the equation is that of G and on the right hand side that of H.\n\nFrom this property, one can deduce that h maps the identity element eG of G to the identity element eH of H, and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that \n h\\left(u^{-1}\\right) = h(u)^{-1}. \\,\n\nHence one can say that h \"is compatible with the group structure\".\n\nOlder notations for the homomorphism h(x) may be xh, though this may be confused as an index or a general subscript. A more recent trend is to write group homomorphisms on the right of their arguments, omitting brackets, so that h(x) becomes simply x h. This approach is especially prevalent in areas of group theory where automata play a role, since it accords better with the convention that automata read words from left to right.\n\nIn areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a homomorphism sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of topological groups is often required to be continuous.\n\nIntuition \n\nThe purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. An equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: The function h : G → H is a group homomorphism if whenever \n\na ∗ b c   we have   h(a) ⋅ h(b) \n h(c). \n\nIn other words, the group H in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as G and the homomorphism h preserves that.\n\nTypes of group homomorphism \n\n;Monomorphism: A group homomorphism that is injective (or, one-to-one); i.e., preserves distinctness.\n;Epimorphism: A group homomorphism that is surjective (or, onto); i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.\n;Isomorphism: A group homomorphism that is bijective; i.e., injective and surjective. Its inverse is also a group homomorphism. In this case, the groups G and H are called isomorphic; they differ only in the notation of their elements and are identical for all practical purposes.\n;Endomorphism: A homomorphism, h: G → G; the domain and codomain are the same. Also called an endomorphism of G.\n;Automorphism: An endomorphism that is bijective, and hence an isomorphism. The set of all automorphisms of a group G, with functional composition as operation, forms itself a group, the automorphism group of G. It is denoted by Aut(G). As an example, the automorphism group of (Z, +) contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with −1; it is isomorphic to Z/2Z.\n\nImage and kernel \n\nWe define the kernel of h to be the set of elements in G which are mapped to the identity in H\n \\operatorname{ker}(h) \\equiv \\left\\{u \\in G\\colon h(u) = e_{H}\\right\\}.\n\nand the image  of h to be\n \\operatorname{im}(h) \\equiv h(G) \\equiv \\left\\{h(u)\\colon u \\in G\\right\\}.\n\nThe kernel and image  of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of a group homomorphism, h(G) is isomorphic to the quotient group G/ker h.\n\nThe kernel of h is a normal subgroup of G  and the image of h is a subgroup of H:\n\\begin{align}\n  h\\left(g^{-1} \\circ u \\circ g\\right) &= h(g)^{-1} \\cdot h(u) \\cdot h(g) \\\\\n                                       &= h(g)^{-1} \\cdot e_H  \\cdot h(g) \\\\\n                                       &h(g)^{-1} \\cdot h(g) \n e_H.\n\\end{align}\n\nIf and only if }, the homomorphism, h, is a group monomorphism; i.e., h is injective (one-to-one). Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:\n\\begin{align}\n                  &&                           h(g_1) &= h(g_2) \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow &&         h(g_1) \\cdot h(g_2)^{-1} &= e_H \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow && h\\left(g_1 \\circ g_2^{-1}\\right) &e_H,\\  \\operatorname{ker}(h) \n \\{e_G\\} \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow     &&               g_1 \\circ g_2^{-1} &= e_G \\\\\n  \\Leftrightarrow &&                              g_1 &= g_2 \n\\end{align}\n\nExamples \n\n* Consider the cyclic group Z/3Z {0, 1, 2} and the group of integers Z with addition. The map h : Z → Z/3Z with h(u) \n u mod 3 is a group homomorphism. It is surjective and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.\n\n* The exponential map yields a group homomorphism from the group of real numbers R with addition to the group of non-zero real numbers R* with multiplication. The kernel is {0} and the image consists of the positive real numbers.\n* The exponential map also yields a group homomorphism from the group of complex numbers C with addition to the group of non-zero complex numbers C* with multiplication. This map is surjective and has the kernel {2πki : k ∈ Z}, as can be seen from Euler's formula.  Fields like R and C that have homomorphisms from their additive group to their multiplicative group are thus called exponential fields.\n\nThe category of groups \n\nIf  and  are group homomorphisms, then so is . This shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a category.\n\nHomomorphisms of abelian groups \n\nIf G and H are abelian (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set  of all group homomorphisms from G to H is itself an abelian group: the sum  of two homomorphisms is defined by\n(h + k)(u) = h(u) + k(u)    for all u in G.\nThe commutativity of H is needed to prove that  is again a group homomorphism.\n\nThe addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if f is in , h, k are elements of , and g is in , then \n   and    .\nSince the composition is associative, this shows that the set End(G) of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a ring, the endomorphism ring of G. For example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the direct sum of m copies of Z/nZ is isomorphic to the ring of m-by-m matrices with entries in Z/nZ. The above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a preadditive category; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an abelian category.",
