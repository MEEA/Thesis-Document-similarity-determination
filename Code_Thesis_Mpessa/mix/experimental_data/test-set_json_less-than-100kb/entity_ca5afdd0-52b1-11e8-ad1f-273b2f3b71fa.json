  "textBody" : "The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement, which adherents believe contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.Gordon B. Hinckley, [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 \"Praise to the Man\"] , 1979-11-04.Church Educational System (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp Book of Mormon Student Manual] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6. It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi..\n\nAccording to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\" engraved on golden plates. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named Moroni, buried it in Cumorah Hill in present-day New York, then returned to Earth in 1827 as an angel,. revealing the location of the plates to Smith, and instructing him to translate it into English for use in the restoration of Christ's true church in the latter days. Critics claim that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve,E.g.  the nature of the Atonement,E.g.  eschatology, redemption from physical and spiritual death,E.g.  and the organization of the latter-day church. The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement, the denominations of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English very similar to the Early Modern English linguistic style of the King James Version of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages. As of 2011, more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon had been published.\n\nOrigin\n\nAccording to Joseph Smith, he was seventeen years of age when an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him[http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith \"The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith\"], Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (2007), xxii–25. and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a nearby hill in present-day Wayne County, New York, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for \"bringing them forth\", i.e., translating them. Smith's description of these events recounts that he was allowed to take the plates on September 22, 1827, exactly four years from that date, and was directed to translate them into English.\n\nAccounts vary of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating. Other accounts variously state that he used one or more seer stones placed in a top hat. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the \"Urim and Thummim\". During the translating process itself, Smith sometimes separated himself from his scribe with a blanket between them. Additionally, the plates were not always present during the translating process, and when present, they were always covered up.\n\nSmith's first published description of the plates said that the plates \"had the appearance of gold\". They were described by Martin Harris, one of Smith's early scribes, as \"fastened together in the shape of a book by wires.\" Smith called the engraved writing on the plates \"reformed Egyptian\". A portion of the text on the plates was also \"sealed\" according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon..\n\nIn addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated that they saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of Three Witnesses[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/thrwtnss \"Testimony of Three Witnesses\"]. and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses.[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/eghtwtns \"Testimony of Eight Witnesses\"]. These statements have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon.\n\nSmith enlisted his neighbor Martin Harris as a scribe during his initial work on the text. (Harris later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon.) In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife Lucy Harris, repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the first 116 pages., ,  After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.Doctrine and Covenants, section 3 and Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah). In 1829, work resumed on the Book of Mormon, with the assistance of Oliver Cowdery, and was completed in a short period (April–June 1829).Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 70.\" Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/jstestimony \"Testimony of Joseph Smith\"]  The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of E. B. Grandin in Palmyra, New York on March 26, 1830. Today, the building in which the Book of Mormon was first published and sold is known as the Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site.\n\nSince its first publication and distribution, critics of the Book of Mormon have claimed that it was fabricated by Smith and that he drew material and ideas from various sources rather than translating an ancient record. Works that have been suggested as sources include the King James Bible, The Wonders of Nature, View of the Hebrews, and an unpublished manuscript written by Solomon Spalding. FairMormon maintains that all of these theories have been disproved and discredited, arguing that both Mormon and non-Mormon historians have found serious flaws in their research. The position of most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement and the official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that the book is an accurate historical record.\n\nContent\n\nTitle\n\nSmith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of \"the very last leaf\" of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian Moroni.Joseph Smith stated that the \"title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation.\" The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is \"to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; ... and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.\"Book of Mormon [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/ttlpg Title Page].\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the First Book of Nephi (1 Nephi) and ending with the Book of Moroni.\n\nThe book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the Words of Mormon and the Book of Ether. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by Mormon. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through Omni are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).\n\nMost modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the \"Testimony of Three Witnesses\" and the \"Testimony of Eight Witnesses\".\n\nChronology\n\nThe books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from \"the small plates of Nephi\". This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship. These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the Nephites and the Lamanites, that frequently warred with each other.\n\nFollowing this section is the Words of Mormon. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by Mormon, is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, Third Nephi, and Fourth Nephi.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/explanation \"A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon\"]. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called \"the large plates of Nephi\" that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The Book of Third Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the Americas sometime after his resurrection and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the Gospels of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.\n\nThe portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the Book of Mormon is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.\n\nAccording to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the Book of Ether) of a record from a previous people called the Jaredites. The account describes a group of families led from the Tower of Babel to the Americas, headed by a man named Jared and his brother. The Jaredite civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,Joseph L. Allen, Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands (2003) p. 8.—long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed.\n\nThe Book of Moroni then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the idolatrous state of the remaining society.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro \"Book of Moroni\"]. It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's testimony and an invitation to pray to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.\n\nDoctrinal and philosophical teachings\n\nThe Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of Christianity and JudaismGary J. Coleman, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/01/the-book-of-mormon-a-guide-for-the-old-testament \"The Book of Mormon: A Guide for the Old Testament\"], Ensign, January 2002. to political and ideological teachings. Jesus is mentioned every 1.7 verses and is referred to by one hundred different names.Susan Ward Easton, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/07/discovery/names-of-christ-in-the-book-of-mormon \"Names of Christ in the Book of Mormon\"], Ensign, July 1978.\n\nJesus\n\nStated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the \"convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.\"\n\nThe book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit \"without flesh and blood\", although with a spirit \"body\" that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.. Jesus is described as \"the Father and the Son\".. He is said to be: \"God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people ... [b]eing the Father and the Son—the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.\" Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as \"one.\" As a result, beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass nontrinitarianism (in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to trinitarianism (particularly among the Community of Christ). See Godhead (Latter Day Saints).\n\nIn furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his resurrection.See  to  Many of the book's contributors described other visions of Jesus, including one by the Brother of Jared who, according to the book, lived before Jesus, and saw the \"body\" of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth. According to the book, a narrator named Nephi described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus, including a prophecy of Jesus' name, said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.See , ; See also \n\nIn the narrative, at the time of King Benjamin (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called \"the children of Christ\". At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of Captain Moroni (73 BC) were called \"Christians\" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ. The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments. Later, the prophet Mormon worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the Bible, Jesus spoke to the Jews in Jerusalem of \"other sheep\" who would hear his voice.See  in the King James Version of the Bible The Book of Mormon claims this meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the lost tribes of Israel throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his resurrection., , \n\nOther distinctive religious teachings\n\nOn most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations. Among its somewhat distinctive theological interpretations are the following:\n* When the Old Testament prophet Isaiah wrote of voices that would \"whisper out of the dust,\"Isaiah 29:4. he was referring to the publication of the Book of Mormon.\n* The fall of man is a prerequisite for procreation, and a necessary requirement for the return to God: \"Adam fell that men might be, and men are, that they might have joy.\"\n* The church should be named after Christ.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.2-8#1 3 Nephi 27:2–8].\n* The atonement of Christ may save unbaptized people who die without a knowledge of the gospel,[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.25#24 2 Nephi 2:25].[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.11-12#10 Mosiah 3:11–12]. including children who die without baptism.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.11-16#10 Moroni 8:11–16].\n* Because of the death and resurrection of Jesus, all humanity (\"both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous\") will be resurrected with an immortal physical body sometime after their death.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45#41 Alma 11:42–45].\n* During Jesus' suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane prior to his crucifixion, blood exudes from every pore on his skin.[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7#6 Mosiah 3:7]. The description of Jesus' sweat in Luke 22:44 is therefore not figurative.\n\nTeachings about political theology\n\nThe book delves into political theology within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are American exceptionalism. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a \"land of promise\", the world's most exceptional land of the time.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; . The book states that any righteous society possessing the land would be protected, whereas if they became wicked they would be destroyed and replaced with a more righteous civilization.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; .\n\nOn the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to \"defend themselves against their enemies\". However, they were never to \"give an offense,\" or to \"raise their sword ... except it were to preserve their lives.\" The book praises the faith of a group of former warriors who took an oath of complete pacifism, refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people. However, 2,060 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,060 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.\n\nThe book recommends monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous. The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king. The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings, choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges. When citizens referred to as \"king-men\" attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces. The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again..\n\nThe book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of \"substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor.\". In one case, all the citizens held their property in common. When individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to \"wear costly apparel\", and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.; ; ; .\n\nReligious significance\n\nJoseph Smith \n\nJoseph Smith characterized the Book of Mormon as the \"keystone\" of Mormonism, and claimed that it was \"the most correct of any book on earth\". Smith produced a written revelation in 1832 that condemned the \"whole church\" for treating the Book of Mormon lightly..\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \n\nThe Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or standard works of the LDS Church.The other texts are the Bible (King James Version), the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price:  (discussing how the four standard works of the church can provide guidance in life). Church leaders have frequently restated Smith's claims of the book's significance to the faith.James E. Faust, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/01/the-keystone-of-our-religion \"The Keystone of Our Religion\"], Ensign, January 2004.  Church members believe that the Book of Mormon is more correct than the Bible because the Bible was the result of a multiple-generation translation process and the Book of Mormon was not.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/11/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion \"The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion\"], Ensign, November 1986.\n\nFor most of the history of the LDS Church, the Book of Mormon was not used as much as other books of scripture such as the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants. This changed in the 1980s when efforts were made to reemphasize the Book of Mormon. As part of this effort, a new edition was printed\nwith the added subtitle \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\".[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/18111/Since-1982-subtitle-has-defined-book-as-another-testament-of-Jesus-Christ.html \"Since 1982, subtitle has defined book as 'another testament of Jesus Christ'\"], Church News, 1988-01-02.[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/book-of-mormon \"Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ\"], mormonnewsroom.org.Boyd K. Packer, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/11/scriptures \"Scriptures\"], Ensign, November 1982.\n\nThe importance of the Book of Mormon was a focus of Ezra Taft Benson, the church's thirteenth president.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/05/cleansing-the-inner-vessel \"Cleansing the Inner Vessel\"], Ensign, May 1986. Benson stated that the church was still under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/11/flooding-the-earth-with-the-book-of-mormon \"Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon\"], Ensign, November 1988.Dallin H. Oaks, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/03/another-testament-of-jesus-christ \"'Another Testament of Jesus Christ'\"], Ensign, March 1994 (reporting that Benson told a meeting of church leaders on 5 March 1987 that \"[t]his condemnation has not been lifted, nor will it be until we repent\"). In an August 2005 message, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end.Gordon B. Hinckley, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/08/a-testimony-vibrant-and-true \"A Testimony Vibrant and True\"], Ensign, August 2005. The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly general conference, at special devotionals by general authorities, and in the church's teaching publications. Since the late 1980s, church members have been encouraged to read from the Book of Mormon daily.\n\nThe LDS Church encourages discovery of the book's truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is sometimes referred to as \"Moroni's Promise\".; see  As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon.\n\nCommunity of Christ\n\nThe Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House: the Authorized Edition, which is based on the original printer's manuscript, and the 1837 Second Edition (or \"Kirtland Edition\") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 \"Revised Authorized Edition\", which attempts to modernize some language.\n\nIn 2001, Community of Christ President W. Grant McMurray reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: \"The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.\"McMurray, W. Grant, [https://archive.is/20050218115333/http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp \"They 'Shall Blossom as the Rose': Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,\"] an address delivered February 17, 2001, cofchrist.org.\n\nAt the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President Stephen M. Veazey ruled out-of-order a resolution to \"reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.\" He stated that \"while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.\"Andrew M. Shields, \"Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007,\" in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007.\n\nGreater Latter Day Saint movement \n\nThere are a number of other churches that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement. Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.\n\nHistorical authenticity\n\nThe archaeological, historical and scientific communities are generally skeptical of the claims that the Book of Mormon is an ancient record of actual historical events. This skepticism tends to focus on four main areas:\n\n* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and known, intact American archaeological sites.Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): \"As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.\"\n* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-Pleistocene, pre-Columbian America, frequently referred to as anachronisms. Items typically listed include cattle,1 Nephi 18:25LDS scholars think that this may be a product of reassigning familiar labels to unfamiliar items. For example, the Delaware Indians named the cow after the deer, and the Miami Indians labeled sheep, when they were first seen, \"looks-like-a cow.\"John L. Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City, Utah : Deseret Book Co. ; Provo, Utah : Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1996 [1985]), 294. [http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html]  horses,1 Nephi 18:25 asses, oxen, sheep, swine, goats,1 Nephi 18:25[http://www.irr.org/mit/smithsonian.html Smithsonian Institution statement on the Book of Mormon] paragraph 4  elephants,Ether 9:19 wheat, steel,1 Nephi 4:9 brass, chains, iron, scimitars, and chariots.Alma 18:9\n* The lack of widely accepted linguistic connections between any Native American languages and Near Eastern languages.\n* The lack of DNA evidence linking any Native American group to the ancient Near East.The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendents of an Israelite migration around 600 BC. However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:Simon G. Southerton. 2004. Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church. Signature Books.The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.\" ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'\" (pg 191)Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans. Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]\n\nMost adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.\"The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith\", Simon G. Southerton (2004, Signature Books), Losing a Lost Tribe, pp. 164-165.\"Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church\", Southerton (2004), pg. 201.Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as \"children of Lehi\" (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).\"Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets\", Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), \"Introduction,\" The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text, ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x. Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several apologetic groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), and Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the limited geography model, which states that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either Mesoamerica, South America, or the Great Lakes area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\n\nManuscripts\n\n \nThe Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several scribes over a period of 13 months, resulting in three manuscripts.\n\nThe 116 lost pages contained the first portion of the Book of Lehi; it was lost after Smith loaned the original, uncopied manuscript to Martin Harris.\n\nThe first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House, and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.\n\nOnly 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.\n\nThe second completed manuscript, called the printer's manuscript, was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes. It is at this point that initial copyediting of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text. Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer's manuscript to David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer's grandson by the Community of Christ, known at the time as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35 million. The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant.There are three lines missing from the printer's manuscript in its current condition, covering 1 Nephi 1:7–8, 20. http://mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol15&num\n1&id=401 The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and was recently made available for viewing online.\n\nCritical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text. The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.\n\nThe printer's manuscript was not used fully in the typesetting of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.\n\nOwnership history: Book of Mormon printer's manuscript\n\nIn the late 19th century the extant portion of the printer's manuscript remained with the family of David Whitmer, who had been a principal founder of the Latter Day Saints and who, by the 1870s, led the Church of Christ (Whitmerite). During the 1870s, according to the Chicago Tribune, the LDS Church unsuccessfully attempted to buy it from Whitmer for a record price. LDS president Joseph F. Smith refuted this assertion in a 1901 letter, believing such a manuscript \"possesses no value whatever.\" In 1895, David Whitmer's grandson George Schweich inherited the manuscript. By 1903 Schweich had mortgaged the manuscript for $1,800 and, needing to raise at least that sum, sold a collection including 72-percent of the Book of the original printer's manuscript (John Whitmer’s manuscript history, parts of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, manuscript copies of several revelations, and a piece of paper containing copied Book of Mormon characters) to the RLDS church (now the Community of Christ) for $2,450, with $2,300 of this amount for the printer's manuscript. The LDS Church had not sought to purchase the manuscript.\n\nIn 2015 this remaining portion was published by the Church Historian's Press in its Joseph Smith Papers series, in Volume Three of \"Revelations and Translations\"; and, in 2017, the LDS Church bought the printer's manuscript for .\n\nEditions\n\nChapter and verse notation systems \n\nThe original 1830 publication did not have verse markers, although the individual books were divided into relatively long chapters. Just as the Bible's present chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapter and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are conventions, not part of the original text.\n\nPublishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48-page booklet titled \"Book of Mormon Chapter & Verse: RLDS–LDS Conversion Table\" to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and vice versa.\n\nThe RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.\n\nCurrent\n\nThe Book of Mormon is currently printed by the following publishers:\n\nHistoric\n\nThe following non-current editions marked major developments in the text or reader's helps printed in the Book of Mormon.\n\nNon-print editions\n\nThe following versions are published online:\n\nTextual criticism\n\nIn 1989, scholars at Brigham Young University began work on a critical text edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions.;; Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.;;\n\nDifferences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past with Mormon apologists viewing the changes as superficial changes done to clarify the meaning of the text.\n\nNon-English translations \n\nThe LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of Latter-day Saints and 87 percent of the world's total population.\n\nTranslations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., Kaqchikel, Tzotzil) are available on audio cassette.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308090404/http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?catalogId10151&storeId\n10151&langId=-1 Welcome] Translations into American Sign Language are available on videocassette and DVD.\n\nTypically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.\n\nIn 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.\n\nRepresentations in media\n\nEvents of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several LDS Church films, including The Life of Nephi (1915), How Rare a Possession (1987) and The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd (2000). Such films in LDS cinema (i.e., films not officially commissioned by the LDS Church) include The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey (2003) and Passage to Zarahemla (2007).\n\nSecond Nephi [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20-27#19 9:20–27] from the Book of Mormon is quoted in a funeral service in Alfred Hitchcock's film Family Plot.\n\nIn 2003, a South Park episode titled \"All About Mormons\" parodied the origins of the Book of Mormon.\n\nIn 2011, a long-running religious satire musical titled The Book of Mormon, by the South Park creators, premiered on Broadway, winning 9 Tony Awards, including best musical. Its London production won the Olivier Award for best musical.\n\nDistribution \n\nThe LDS Church, which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been printed since its initial publication.[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/60797/150-Million-and-Counting-The-Book-of-Mormon-reaches-another-milestone.html \"150 Million and Counting: The Book of Mormon reaches another milestone\"], Church News, 2011-04-18.\n\nThe initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies.[http://www.lds.org/church/news/book-of-mormon-reaches-150-million-copies \"Book of Mormon Reaches 150 Million Copies\"], lds.org, 2011-04-20.

Hinckley, [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 \"Praise to the Man\"] , 1979-11-04.Church Educational System (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp Book of Mormon Student Manual] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6. It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi..\n\nAccording to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\" engraved on golden plates. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named Moroni, buried it in Cumorah Hill in present-day New York, then returned to Earth in 1827 as an angel,. revealing the location of the plates to Smith, and instructing him to translate it into English for use in the restoration of Christ's true church in the latter days. Critics claim that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve,E.g.  the nature of the Atonement,E.g.  eschatology, redemption from physical and spiritual death,E.g.  and the organization of the latter-day church. The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement, the denominations of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English very similar to the Early Modern English linguistic style of the King James Version of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages. As of 2011, more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon had been published.\n\nOrigin\n\nAccording to Joseph Smith, he was seventeen years of age when an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him[http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith \"The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith\"], Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (2007), xxii–25. and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a nearby hill in present-day Wayne County, New York, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for \"bringing them forth\", i.e., translating them. Smith's description of these events recounts that he was allowed to take the plates on September 22, 1827, exactly four years from that date, and was directed to translate them into English.\n\nAccounts vary of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating. Other accounts variously state that he used one or more seer stones placed in a top hat. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the \"Urim and Thummim\". During the translating process itself, Smith sometimes separated himself from his scribe with a blanket between them. Additionally, the plates were not always present during the translating process, and when present, they were always covered up.\n\nSmith's first published description of the plates said that the plates \"had the appearance of gold\". They were described by Martin Harris, one of Smith's early scribes, as \"fastened together in the shape of a book by wires.\" Smith called the engraved writing on the plates \"reformed Egyptian\". A portion of the text on the plates was also \"sealed\" according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon..\n\nIn addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated that they saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of Three Witnesses[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/thrwtnss \"Testimony of Three Witnesses\"]. and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses.[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/eghtwtns \"Testimony of Eight Witnesses\"]. These statements have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon.\n\nSmith enlisted his neighbor Martin Harris as a scribe during his initial work on the text. (Harris later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon.) In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife Lucy Harris, repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the first 116 pages., ,  After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.Doctrine and Covenants, section 3 and Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah). In 1829, work resumed on the Book of Mormon, with the assistance of Oliver Cowdery, and was completed in a short period (April–June 1829).Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 70.\" Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/jstestimony \"Testimony of Joseph Smith\"]  The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of E. B. Grandin in Palmyra, New York on March 26, 1830. Today, the building in which the Book of Mormon was first published and sold is known as the Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site.\n\nSince its first publication and distribution, critics of the Book of Mormon have claimed that it was fabricated by Smith and that he drew material and ideas from various sources rather than translating an ancient record. Works that have been suggested as sources include the King James Bible, The Wonders of Nature, View of the Hebrews, and an unpublished manuscript written by Solomon Spalding. FairMormon maintains that all of these theories have been disproved and discredited, arguing that both Mormon and non-Mormon historians have found serious flaws in their research. The position of most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement and the official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that the book is an accurate historical record.\n\nContent\n\nTitle\n\nSmith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of \"the very last leaf\" of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian Moroni.Joseph Smith stated that the \"title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation.\" The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is \"to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; ... and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.\"Book of Mormon [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/ttlpg Title Page].\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the First Book of Nephi (1 Nephi) and ending with the Book of Moroni.\n\nThe book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the Words of Mormon and the Book of Ether. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by Mormon. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through Omni are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).\n\nMost modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the \"Testimony of Three Witnesses\" and the \"Testimony of Eight Witnesses\".\n\nChronology\n\nThe books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from \"the small plates of Nephi\". This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship. These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the Nephites and the Lamanites, that frequently warred with each other.\n\nFollowing this section is the Words of Mormon. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by Mormon, is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, Third Nephi, and Fourth Nephi.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/explanation \"A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon\"]. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called \"the large plates of Nephi\" that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The Book of Third Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the Americas sometime after his resurrection and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the Gospels of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.\n\nThe portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the Book of Mormon is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.\n\nAccording to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the Book of Ether) of a record from a previous people called the Jaredites. The account describes a group of families led from the Tower of Babel to the Americas, headed by a man named Jared and his brother. The Jaredite civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,Joseph L. Allen, Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands (2003) p. 8.—long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed.\n\nThe Book of Moroni then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the idolatrous state of the remaining society.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro \"Book of Moroni\"]. It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's testimony and an invitation to pray to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.\n\nDoctrinal and philosophical teachings\n\nThe Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of Christianity and JudaismGary J. Coleman, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/01/the-book-of-mormon-a-guide-for-the-old-testament \"The Book of Mormon: A Guide for the Old Testament\"], Ensign, January 2002. to political and ideological teachings. Jesus is mentioned every 1.7 verses and is referred to by one hundred different names.Susan Ward Easton, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/07/discovery/names-of-christ-in-the-book-of-mormon \"Names of Christ in the Book of Mormon\"], Ensign, July 1978.\n\nJesus\n\nStated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the \"convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.\"\n\nThe book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit \"without flesh and blood\", although with a spirit \"body\" that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.. Jesus is described as \"the Father and the Son\".. He is said to be: \"God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people ... [b]eing the Father and the Son—the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.\" Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as \"one.\" As a result, beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass nontrinitarianism (in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to trinitarianism (particularly among the Community of Christ). See Godhead (Latter Day Saints).\n\nIn furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his resurrection.See  to  Many of the book's contributors described other visions of Jesus, including one by the Brother of Jared who, according to the book, lived before Jesus, and saw the \"body\" of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth. According to the book, a narrator named Nephi described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus, including a prophecy of Jesus' name, said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.See , ; See also \n\nIn the narrative, at the time of King Benjamin (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called \"the children of Christ\". At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of Captain Moroni (73 BC) were called \"Christians\" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ. The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments. Later, the prophet Mormon worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the Bible, Jesus spoke to the Jews in Jerusalem of \"other sheep\" who would hear his voice.See  in the King James Version of the Bible The Book of Mormon claims this meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the lost tribes of Israel throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his resurrection., , \n\nOther distinctive religious teachings\n\nOn most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations. Among its somewhat distinctive theological interpretations are the following:\n* When the Old Testament prophet Isaiah wrote of voices that would \"whisper out of the dust,\"Isaiah 29:4. he was referring to the publication of the Book of Mormon.\n* The fall of man is a prerequisite for procreation, and a necessary requirement for the return to God: \"Adam fell that men might be, and men are, that they might have joy.\"\n* The church should be named after Christ.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.2-8#1 3 Nephi 27:2–8].\n* The atonement of Christ may save unbaptized people who die without a knowledge of the gospel,[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.25#24 2 Nephi 2:25].[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.11-12#10 Mosiah 3:11–12]. including children who die without baptism.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.11-16#10 Moroni 8:11–16].\n* Because of the death and resurrection of Jesus, all humanity (\"both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous\") will be resurrected with an immortal physical body sometime after their death.[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45#41 Alma 11:42–45].\n* During Jesus' suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane prior to his crucifixion, blood exudes from every pore on his skin.[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7#6 Mosiah 3:7]. The description of Jesus' sweat in Luke 22:44 is therefore not figurative.\n\nTeachings about political theology\n\nThe book delves into political theology within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are American exceptionalism. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a \"land of promise\", the world's most exceptional land of the time.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; . The book states that any righteous society possessing the land would be protected, whereas if they became wicked they would be destroyed and replaced with a more righteous civilization.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; .\n\nOn the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to \"defend themselves against their enemies\". However, they were never to \"give an offense,\" or to \"raise their sword ... except it were to preserve their lives.\" The book praises the faith of a group of former warriors who took an oath of complete pacifism, refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people. However, 2,060 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,060 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.\n\nThe book recommends monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous. The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king. The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings, choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges. When citizens referred to as \"king-men\" attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces. The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again..\n\nThe book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of \"substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor.\". In one case, all the citizens held their property in common. When individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to \"wear costly apparel\", and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.; ; ; .\n\nReligious significance\n\nJoseph Smith \n\nJoseph Smith characterized the Book of Mormon as the \"keystone\" of Mormonism, and claimed that it was \"the most correct of any book on earth\". Smith produced a written revelation in 1832 that condemned the \"whole church\" for treating the Book of Mormon lightly..\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \n\nThe Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or standard works of the LDS Church.The other texts are the Bible (King James Version), the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price:  (discussing how the four standard works of the church can provide guidance in life). Church leaders have frequently restated Smith's claims of the book's significance to the faith.James E. Faust, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/01/the-keystone-of-our-religion \"The Keystone of Our Religion\"], Ensign, January 2004.  Church members believe that the Book of Mormon is more correct than the Bible because the Bible was the result of a multiple-generation translation process and the Book of Mormon was not.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/11/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion \"The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion\"], Ensign, November 1986.\n\nFor most of the history of the LDS Church, the Book of Mormon was not used as much as other books of scripture such as the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants. This changed in the 1980s when efforts were made to reemphasize the Book of Mormon. As part of this effort, a new edition was printed\nwith the added subtitle \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\".[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/18111/Since-1982-subtitle-has-defined-book-as-another-testament-of-Jesus-Christ.html \"Since 1982, subtitle has defined book as 'another testament of Jesus Christ'\"], Church News, 1988-01-02.[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/book-of-mormon \"Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ\"], mormonnewsroom.org.Boyd K. Packer, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/11/scriptures \"Scriptures\"], Ensign, November 1982.\n\nThe importance of the Book of Mormon was a focus of Ezra Taft Benson, the church's thirteenth president.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/05/cleansing-the-inner-vessel \"Cleansing the Inner Vessel\"], Ensign, May 1986. Benson stated that the church was still under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly.Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/11/flooding-the-earth-with-the-book-of-mormon \"Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon\"], Ensign, November 1988.Dallin H. Oaks, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/03/another-testament-of-jesus-christ \"'Another Testament of Jesus Christ'\"], Ensign, March 1994 (reporting that Benson told a meeting of church leaders on 5 March 1987 that \"[t]his condemnation has not been lifted, nor will it be until we repent\"). In an August 2005 message, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end.Gordon B. Hinckley, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/08/a-testimony-vibrant-and-true \"A Testimony Vibrant and True\"], Ensign, August 2005. The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly general conference, at special devotionals by general authorities, and in the church's teaching publications. Since the late 1980s, church members have been encouraged to read from the Book of Mormon daily.\n\nThe LDS Church encourages discovery of the book's truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is sometimes referred to as \"Moroni's Promise\".; see  As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon.\n\nCommunity of Christ\n\nThe Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House: the Authorized Edition, which is based on the original printer's manuscript, and the 1837 Second Edition (or \"Kirtland Edition\") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 \"Revised Authorized Edition\", which attempts to modernize some language.\n\nIn 2001, Community of Christ President W. Grant McMurray reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: \"The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.\"McMurray, W. Grant, [https://archive.is/20050218115333/http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp \"They 'Shall Blossom as the Rose': Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,\"] an address delivered February 17, 2001, cofchrist.org.\n\nAt the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President Stephen M. Veazey ruled out-of-order a resolution to \"reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.\" He stated that \"while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.\"Andrew M. Shields, \"Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007,\" in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007.\n\nGreater Latter Day Saint movement \n\nThere are a number of other churches that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement. Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.\n\nHistorical authenticity\n\nThe archaeological, historical and scientific communities are generally skeptical of the claims that the Book of Mormon is an ancient record of actual historical events. This skepticism tends to focus on four main areas:\n\n* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and known, intact American archaeological sites.Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): \"As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.\"\n* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-Pleistocene, pre-Columbian America, frequently referred to as anachronisms. Items typically listed include cattle,1 Nephi 18:25LDS scholars think that this may be a product of reassigning familiar labels to unfamiliar items. For example, the Delaware Indians named the cow after the deer, and the Miami Indians labeled sheep, when they were first seen, \"looks-like-a cow.\"John L. Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City, Utah : Deseret Book Co. ; Provo, Utah : Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1996 [1985]), 294. [http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html]  horses,1 Nephi 18:25 asses, oxen, sheep, swine, goats,1 Nephi 18:25[http://www.irr.org/mit/smithsonian.html Smithsonian Institution statement on the Book of Mormon] paragraph 4  elephants,Ether 9:19 wheat, steel,1 Nephi 4:9 brass, chains, iron, scimitars, and chariots.Alma 18:9\n* The lack of widely accepted linguistic connections between any Native American languages and Near Eastern languages.\n* The lack of DNA evidence linking any Native American group to the ancient Near East.The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendents of an Israelite migration around 600 BC. However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:Simon G. Southerton. 2004. Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church. Signature Books.The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.\" ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'\" (pg 191)Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans. Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]\n\nMost adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.\"The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith\", Simon G. Southerton (2004, Signature Books), Losing a Lost Tribe, pp. 164-165.\"Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church\", Southerton (2004), pg. 201.Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as \"children of Lehi\" (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).\"Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets\", Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), \"Introduction,\" The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text, ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x. Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several apologetic groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), and Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the limited geography model, which states that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either Mesoamerica, South America, or the Great Lakes area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\n\nManuscripts\n\n \nThe Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several scribes over a period of 13 months, resulting in three manuscripts.\n\nThe 116 lost pages contained the first portion of the Book of Lehi; it was lost after Smith loaned the original, uncopied manuscript to Martin Harris.\n\nThe first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House, and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.\n\nOnly 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.\n\nThe second completed manuscript, called the printer's manuscript, was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes. It is at this point that initial copyediting of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text. Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer's manuscript to David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer's grandson by the Community of Christ, known at the time as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35 million. The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant.There are three lines missing from the printer's manuscript in its current condition, covering 1 Nephi 1:7–8, 20. http://mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol15&num\n1&id=401 The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and was recently made available for viewing online.\n\nCritical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text. The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.\n\nThe printer's manuscript was not used fully in the typesetting of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.\n\nOwnership history: Book of Mormon printer's manuscript\n\nIn the late 19th century the extant portion of the printer's manuscript remained with the family of David Whitmer, who had been a principal founder of the Latter Day Saints and who, by the 1870s, led the Church of Christ (Whitmerite). During the 1870s, according to the Chicago Tribune, the LDS Church unsuccessfully attempted to buy it from Whitmer for a record price. LDS president Joseph F. Smith refuted this assertion in a 1901 letter, believing such a manuscript \"possesses no value whatever.\" In 1895, David Whitmer's grandson George Schweich inherited the manuscript. By 1903 Schweich had mortgaged the manuscript for $1,800 and, needing to raise at least that sum, sold a collection including 72-percent of the Book of the original printer's manuscript (John Whitmer’s manuscript history, parts of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, manuscript copies of several revelations, and a piece of paper containing copied Book of Mormon characters) to the RLDS church (now the Community of Christ) for $2,450, with $2,300 of this amount for the printer's manuscript. The LDS Church had not sought to purchase the manuscript.\n\nIn 2015 this remaining portion was published by the Church Historian's Press in its Joseph Smith Papers series, in Volume Three of \"Revelations and Translations\"; and, in 2017, the LDS Church bought the printer's manuscript for .\n\nEditions\n\nChapter and verse notation systems \n\nThe original 1830 publication did not have verse markers, although the individual books were divided into relatively long chapters. Just as the Bible's present chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapter and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are conventions, not part of the original text.\n\nPublishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48-page booklet titled \"Book of Mormon Chapter & Verse: RLDS–LDS Conversion Table\" to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and vice versa.\n\nThe RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.\n\nCurrent\n\nThe Book of Mormon is currently printed by the following publishers:\n\nHistoric\n\nThe following non-current editions marked major developments in the text or reader's helps printed in the Book of Mormon.\n\nNon-print editions\n\nThe following versions are published online:\n\nTextual criticism\n\nIn 1989, scholars at Brigham Young University began work on a critical text edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions.;; Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.;;\n\nDifferences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past with Mormon apologists viewing the changes as superficial changes done to clarify the meaning of the text.\n\nNon-English translations \n\nThe LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of Latter-day Saints and 87 percent of the world's total population.\n\nTranslations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., Kaqchikel, Tzotzil) are available on audio cassette.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308090404/http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?catalogId10151&storeId\n10151&langId=-1 Welcome] Translations into American Sign Language are available on videocassette and DVD.\n\nTypically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.\n\nIn 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.\n\nRepresentations in media\n\nEvents of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several LDS Church films, including The Life of Nephi (1915), How Rare a Possession (1987) and The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd (2000). Such films in LDS cinema (i.e., films not officially commissioned by the LDS Church) include The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey (2003) and Passage to Zarahemla (2007).\n\nSecond Nephi [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20-27#19 9:20–27] from the Book of Mormon is quoted in a funeral service in Alfred Hitchcock's film Family Plot.\n\nIn 2003, a South Park episode titled \"All About Mormons\" parodied the origins of the Book of Mormon.\n\nIn 2011, a long-running religious satire musical titled The Book of Mormon, by the South Park creators, premiered on Broadway, winning 9 Tony Awards, including best musical. Its London production won the Olivier Award for best musical.\n\nDistribution \n\nThe LDS Church, which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been printed since its initial publication.[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/60797/150-Million-and-Counting-The-Book-of-Mormon-reaches-another-milestone.html \"150 Million and Counting: The Book of Mormon reaches another milestone\"], Church News, 2011-04-18.\n\nThe initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies.[http://www.lds.org/church/news/book-of-mormon-reaches-150-million-copies \"Book of Mormon Reaches 150 Million Copies\"], lds.org, 2011-04-20.
