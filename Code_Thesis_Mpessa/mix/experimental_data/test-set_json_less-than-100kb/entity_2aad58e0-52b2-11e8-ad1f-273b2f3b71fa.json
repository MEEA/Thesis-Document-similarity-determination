Conceived and financed by Thomas Read Kemp, it has given its name to the larger Kemptown region of Brighton.

Building work started in 1823 on Arundel Terrace, Chichester Terrace, Lewes Crescent and Sussex Square. Chichester Terrace incorporated the earlier Chichester House.  In 1837 Thomas Kemp fled the country to escape his creditors.  The project continued under Cubitt with the support of the Fifth Earl of Bristol.
