  "textBody" : "The Republic of Ireland had a population of 4,757,976 at the 2016 census.\n\nDemographic history \n\nThe island of Ireland, throughout most of its history, had a small population, comparable to that of other regions of similar area in Europe. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Ireland experienced a major population boom as a result of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. In the 50-year period 1790-1840, the population of the island doubled from 4 million to 8 million. At its peak, Ireland's population density was similar to that of England and continental Europe.\n\nThis changed dramatically with the Great Famine of the mid-19th century, which led to mass starvation and consequent mass emigration. In the area covering the present day Republic of Ireland, the population reached about 6.5 million in the mid 1840s. Ten years later it was down to 5 million. The population continued a slow decline well into the 20th century, with the Republic recording a low of 2.8 million in the 1961 census.[http://www.census.ie/-in-History/Population-of-Ireland-1841-2006.151.1.aspx Census.ie - Population of Ireland 1841 - 2006] \n\nDuring the 1960s, the population started to grow once more, although slowly as emigration was still common. In the 1990s the country entered a period of rapid growth as a result of the Celtic Tiger Irish economic boom. Immigration began to far outweigh emigration. Many former Irish emigrants returned home, and the Republic of Ireland became an attractive destination for immigrants, mainly from Central Europe, but also from Africa, Asia and elsewhere. However, with the 2008 onset of the Irish economic and banking crisis, the state's economy suffered, and since then the Republic of Ireland has once again been experiencing net emigration.\n\nIn November 2013, Eurostat reported that the republic had the largest net emigration rate of any member state, at 7.6 emigrants per 1,000 population. However, it has the youngest population of any European Union member state and its population size is predicted to grow for many decades, in contrast with the declining population predicted for most European countries. A report published in 2008 predicted that the population would reach 6.7 million by 2060.[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0826/population.html RTÉ News - Irish population to hit 6.7m by 2060] The Republic has also been experiencing a baby boom, with increasing birth rates and overall fertility rates.[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/08/28/story70956.asp Irish Examiner - Baby boom as Irish births reach highest level since 1982]  Despite this, the total fertility rate is still below replacement. This increase is primarily fuelled by non-Irish immigration – in 2009, a quarter of all children born in the Republic were born to mothers who had immigrated from other countries.\n\nEthnic groups and immigration \n\nGaelic culture and language forms an important part of the Irish national identity.\n\nThe Irish Travellers are an indigenous minority ethnic group, formally recognised by the Irish State since March 1st 2017. \n\nIn 2008, Ireland had the highest birth rate (18.1 per 1,000), lowest death rate (6.1 per 1,000) and highest net-migration rate (14.1 per 1,000) in the entire European Union – and the largest population growth rate (4.4%) in the 27-member bloc as a result.[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/baby-boom-puts-us-on-top-of-birth-rate-league-1595151.html Irish Independent - Baby boom puts us on top of birth rate league]\n\nIreland contains several immigrant communities, especially in Dublin. The most common foreign nationalities include Polish, British, Lithuanian, Latvian and Nigerian.\n\nThere is strong genetic evidence of pre-Celtic migration into Ireland.  The Irish culture may therefore be described as strongly influenced by Celtic language and traditions but the Irish population is not wholly or even mainly of Celtic origin. \n\nPopulation statistics \n\nCurrent natural growth\n\n*Births from January–June 2016 =  32,699\n*Births from January–June 2017 =  31,709\n\n*Deaths from January–June 2016 =  16,306\n*Deaths from January–June 2017 =  16,382\n\n*Natural growth from January–June 2016 =  16,393\n*Natural growth from January–June 2017 =  15,327\n\nDemographic statistics\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the Republic of Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO), Eurostat and the CIA World Factbook.\n\nPopulation\n\nFigures from the CSO.\n\n4,757,976 (2016 census)\n\nAge structure\n\n0–14 years: 21.3% (male: 501,189; female: 478,401) (2011)\n15–64 years: 67.0% (male: 1,558,196; female: 1,545,073) (2011)\n65 years and over: 11.7% (female: 292,079; male: 243,314) (2011)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.07 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years: 1.07 male(s)/female\n15–64 years: 1 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.8 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 0.99 male(s)/female (2008)\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal:\n3.78 deaths/1,000 live births (2013)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 80.19 years (2011)\nfemale: 82.55 years (2011)\nmale: 77.96 years (2011)\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n1.9 children born/woman (2016)[http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-vsys/vitalstatisticsyearlysummary2016/ Central Statistics Office Ireland - Report on Vital Statistics 2016]\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\n– adult prevalence rate: 0.1% (2001 est.)\n- people living with HIV/AIDS: 6,900 (2008 est.)\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Irishman (men), Irishwoman (women), Irish (collective plural)\nadjective: Irish\n\nNationalities in the Republic of Ireland\n\nIrish (including dual-Irish/other): 86.9%, UK: 2.5%, Other EU 27: 6.1%, Other Europe: 0.7%, Asia: 1.5%, Africa: 0.9%, USA: 0.2%, Other countries: 0.5%, Multiple nationality: 0.1%, Not stated: 1.2% (2011)\n\nBelow are the 14 largest immigrant groups in the Republic of Ireland according to the 2016 census .\n\nEthnic groups\n\nIrish, with Norse (Scandinavian), Norman, English, French, Scottish, and Welsh, Ulster-Scots and various immigrant populations – the largest immigrant groups, with over 10,000 people, are the British, Poles, Americans, Lithuanians, Latvians, Germans, Nigerians, Indians, Pakistanis and Chinese.[http://www.cso.ie/statistics/placebirthagegroup.htm CSO Ireland - Persons usually resident and present in the State on Census Night (2006), classified by place of birth and age group] .\n\nEthnic backgrounds: White Irish: 82.2%, White Irish Traveller: 0.7%, Other White: 9.5% (total White: 92.4%), Asian: 2.1%, Black: 1.3%, Other: 1.5%, Not Stated: 2.6% (2016)\n\nReligions\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is a predominantly Christian country.
