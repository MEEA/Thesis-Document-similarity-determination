  "textBody" : "High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot.Brian Stableford, The A to Z of Fantasy Literature, (p. 198), Scarecrow Press, Plymouth. 2005.  The term \"high fantasy\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\" (originally given at the New England Round Table of Children's Librarians in October 1969).\n\nGenre overview\n\nHigh fantasy is defined as fantasy set in an alternative, fictional (\"secondary\") world, rather than \"the real\", or \"primary\" world. The secondary world is usually internally consistent, but its rules differ from those of the primary world. By contrast, low fantasy is characterized by being set in the primary, or \"real\" world, or a rational and familiar fictional world, with the inclusion of magical elements.C.W.

(p. 123)\n\nMany high fantasy stories are told from the viewpoint of one main hero. Often, much of the plot revolves around his or her heritage or mysterious nature. In many novels the hero is an orphan or unusual sibling, often with an extraordinary talent for magic or combat. He or she begins the story young, if not as an actual child. In other works the hero is a completely developed individual with a unique character and spirit.\n\nThe hero often begins as a childlike figure, but matures rapidly, experiencing a huge gain in fighting/problem-solving abilities along the way.Casey Lieb, \"[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/gm/lieb14.html Unlikely Heroes and their role in Fantasy Literature]\" The plot of the story often depicts the hero's fight against the evil forces as a Bildungsroman.\n\nIn many books there is a knowing, mystical mentor/teacher. This character is often a formidable wizard or warrior, who provides the main character with advice and help.\n\nIn some books, there is also a mysterious Dark Lord, often obsessed with taking over the world and killing the main hero. This character is an evil wizard or sorcerer, or sometimes a kind of god or demon. This character commands a huge army and a group of highly feared servants. In some works the villain may have had a predecessor/s who might have been superior or inferior to them.\n\nThe progress of the story leads to the character learning the nature of the unknown forces against him, that they constitute a force with great power and malevolence.Patricia A. McKillip, \"Writing High Fantasy\", p 53, Philip Martin, ed., The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest, \n\nThe good versus evil fighting against each other is a common theme in high fantasy, and the character of evil is often an important theme in a work of high fantasy,Tom Shippey, J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century, p 120,  as in The Lord of the Rings.
