  "textBody" : "\"Go Down Moses\"  is an American Negro spiritual. It describes  events in the Old Testament of the Bible, specifically [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchExodus+8%3A1&version\nKJV Exodus 8:1]: \"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me\", in which God commands Moses to demand the release of the Israelites from bondage in Egypt. The opening verse as published by the Jubilee Singers in 1872:\n\nIn the song \"Israel\" represents the African-American slaves while \"Egypt\" and \"Pharaoh\" represent the slavemaster.Cornelius, Steven (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?iddjB6xJ1CNeoC&pg\nPA118&dq= Music of the Civil War Era]. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 118. \nGoing \"down\" to Egypt is derived from the Biblical origin; the Bible generally recognizes Egypt as being at a lower altitude than Jerusalem and other core areas of Israelite territory; thus, going to Egypt means going \"down\"For example, in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchGenesis+42&version\nKJV Genesis 42:2] Jacob commands his sons to \"go down to Egypt\" to buy grain while going away from Egypt is \"up\".In [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchExodus+1&version\nKJV Exodus 1:10], Pharaoh expresses apprehension that the Hebrews would join Egypt's enemies and \"go up [i.e. away] from the land\" In the context of American slavery, this ancient sense of \"down\" converged with the concept of \"down the river\" (the Mississippi), where slaves' conditions were notoriously worse, a situation which left the idiom \"sell [someone] down the river\" in present-day English.[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/326500.html Phrases.org.uk]\n\n\"Oh! Let My People Go\"\n\nAlthough usually thought of as a spiritual, the earliest recorded use of the song was as a rallying anthem for the Contrabands at Fort Monroe sometime before July 1862. Early authorities presumed it was composed by them. Sheet music was soon after published, titled \"Oh! Let My People Go: The Song of the Contrabands\", and arranged by Horace Waters. L.C. Lockwood, chaplain of the Contrabands, stated in the sheet music the song was from Virginia, dating from about 1853.Lockwood, \"Oh! Let My People Go\", p. 5: \"This Song has been sung for about nine years by the Slaves of Virginia.\" The opening verse, as recorded by Lockwood, is:\n\nSarah Bradford's authorized biography of Harriet Tubman, Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman (1869), quotes Tubman as saying she used \"Go Down Moses\" as one of two code songs fugitive slaves used to communicate when fleeing Maryland. Tubman began her underground railroad work in 1850 and continued until the beginning of the Civil War, so it's possible Tubman's use of the song predates the origin claimed by Lockwood.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\n\n* Jess Lee Brooks sings it in Preston Sturges' film Sullivan's Travels (1941).\n* Gregory Miller (played by Sidney Poitier) sang the song in the  film Blackboard Jungle (1955).\n* A reference is made to the song in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), when a bedridden Cameron Frye sings, \"When Cameron was in Egypt's land, let my Cameron go\".\n* Sergei Bodrov Jr. and Oleg Menshikov, who play the two main characters in Sergei Bodrov's film Кавказский пленник (1996; [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116754/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd Prisoner of the Mountains]) dance to the Louis Armstrong version.\n* The teen comedy film Easy A (2010) remixed this song with a fast guitar and beats. The song was originally published as Original Soundtrack and is listed in IMDb.\n\nLiterature\n\n* William Faulkner titled his short story collection/novel Go Down, Moses (1942) after the song.\n\nMusic\n\n* The song was made famous by Paul Robeson whose voice, deep and resonant as it was, was said by Robert O'Meally to have assumed \"the might and authority of God.\"\n* On February 7, 1958, the song was recorded in New York City and sung by Louis Armstrong with Sy Oliver's Orchestra.\n* It was recorded by Doris Akers and the Sky Pilot Choir.\n* The song has since become a jazz standard, having been recorded by Grant Green, Fats Waller, Archie Shepp, Hampton Hawes and many others.\n* It is one of the five spirituals included in the oratorio A Child of Our Time, first performed in 1944, by the English classical composer Michael Tippett (190598).\n* A Hebrew translation of the song is a common element in the Passover seder in Israel.\n* The song was recorded by Deep River Boys in Oslo on September 26, 1960. It was released on the extended play Negro Spirituals No. 3 (HMV 7EGN 39).\n* The song, or a modified version of it, has been used in the Roger Jones musical From Pharaoh to Freedom\n* The French singer Claude Nougaro used its melody for his tribute to Louis Armstrong in French, under the name Armstrong (1965).\n* The song heavily influences \"Get Down Moses\", by Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros on their album Streetcore (2003).\n* The song has been performed by the Russian Interior Ministry (MVD) Choir.\n* Jazz singer Tony Vittia released a swing version under the name \"Own The Night\" (2013).\n* The phrase \"Go Down Moses\" is featured in the chorus of the John Craigie song, \"Will Not Fight\" (2009).\n* The phrase \"Go Down Moses\" is sung by Pops Staples in the song The Weight in The Last Waltz film by The Band (1976).  The usual lyric is actually \"Go down Miss Moses\".\n\nTelevision\n\n* The NBC television comedy The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air twice used the song for comedic effect. In the first instance, Will Smith's character sings the song after he and his cousin Carlton Banks are thrown into prison (Smith sings the first two lines, Banks sullenly provides the refrain, then a prisoner sings the final four lines in an operatic voice.) In the second instance, Banks is preparing for an Easter service and attempts to show off his prowess by singing the last two lines of the chorus; Smith replies with his own version, in which he makes a joke about Carlton's height (\"...Let my cousin grow!\").\n* The song is sung in the miniseries The Spies of Warsaw (2013).\n* Della Reese sings it in Episode 424, \"Elijah\", of Touched by an Angel, which Bruce Davison sings \"Eliyahu\".\n\nRecordings\n\n*The Tuskegee Institute Singers recorded the song for Victor in 1914.Gibbs, Craig Martin (2012).
