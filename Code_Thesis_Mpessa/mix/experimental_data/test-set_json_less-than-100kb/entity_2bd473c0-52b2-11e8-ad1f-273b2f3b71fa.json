  "textBody" : "Robert James Ritchie (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as Kid Rock, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, musician, record producer, activist and actor. In a career spanning over 20 years, Kid Rock's music has encompassed rock, hip hop and country. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist who can play every instrument in his backing band, Twisted Brown Trucker, Kid Rock has overseen his own production on nine of his eleven studio albums.\n\nKid Rock started his professional music career as a self-taught rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast in 1990 on the major record label Jive; his subsequent independent releases The Polyfuze Method and Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp saw him developing a more distinctive style which was fully realized on his 1998 album Devil Without a Cause; this and his subsequent album Cocky were noted for blending elements of hip hop, country and heavy metal; his song \"Cowboy\" has been credited as being instrumental in the development of country rap. Starting with his 2010 album Born Free, the country music style has dominated Kid Rock's musical direction, and since 2007's Rock N Roll Jesus until 2017's Sweet Southern Sugar, Kid Rock has not released new rap songs.\n\nEarly life\n\nKid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie on January 17, 1971, in Romeo, Michigan, to father William Ritchie, owner of multiple car dealerships, and mother Susan Ritchie. Ritchie's father owned a six-acre estate where Ritchie grew up, regularly helping his family pick apples and caring for their horses.\n\nIn the 1980s, Ritchie became interested in hip hop, began to breakdance and taught himself how to rap and DJ and participated in local talent shows in Detroit. A self-taught musician, Ritchie is reported to play every instrument in his backing band, according to CBS.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career, signing with Jive Records and Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast (1988–1990)\n\nKid Rock began his professional music career as a member of the hip hop music group The Beast Crew in the late 1980s. During this time, Kid Rock met rapper D-Nice, which led to Kid Rock opening at local shows for Boogie Down Productions.\n\nDuring this time, Kid Rock began his professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who was initially skeptical of the idea of a white rapper, but was impressed by Kid Rock's performance; Kid Rock had prepared his own beats and used his own turntables to demonstrate his skills for Clark.\n\nIn 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock, which led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records.\n\nIn 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder of the independent record label Top Dog Records, formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, in 1988; Kid Rock's investment in the company gave him 25% ownership.\n\nWith the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast in 1990. According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who Kid Rock claimed felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.\n\nThe album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yos and Too Short; Detroit artist Champtown served as Kid Rock's DJ on this tour.http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id\n7099 During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.\n\nUltimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.\n\nSigning with Continuum Records and The Polyfuze Method (1992–1995)\n\nIn 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum. Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo. While ICP member Violent J disliked Kid Rock's music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP's debut album, Carnival of Carnage, believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist. Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP's album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper. Kid Rock showed up to record the song \"Is That You?\" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.\n\nIn 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, The Polyfuze Method, with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.\n\nKid Rock also began releasing his \"Bootleg\" cassette series to keep local interest in his music.\n\nLater in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP Fire It Up at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise. The EP featured the song \"I Am the Bullgod\" and a cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s country song \"A Country Boy Can Survive\".\n\nBy 1994, Kid Rock's live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and Uncle Kracker, but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band Twisted Brown Trucker.\n\nAfter breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment. During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of Billy Joel's \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", entitled \"It's Still East Detroit to Me\", which Clark claims led the producer to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.\n\nDuring this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse; according to Mike E. Clark, who worked with both artists, Kid Rock was frustrated with ICP's local success, as Kid Rock disliked ICP's music, and wanted to become more successful than ICP.\n\nThrough extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as \"white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap\"; this following included local rapper Joe C, who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting Kid Rock, was invited to perform on stage as Kid Rock's hype man.\n\nEarly Mornin' Stoned Pimp and local breakthrough (1996)\n\nKid Rock's stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name \"Kid Rock\", and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp; the album's title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, \"Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp.\" According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp sold 14,000 copies.\n\nKid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.\n\nThough Kid Rock had becone known for frequent partying, and using drugs and alcohol, he was predominately focused on increasing his success and fame, placing himself as a businessman first; the result of this drive led to increased success locally.\n\nSigning with Atlantic Records, Devil Without a Cause and national success (1997–1998)\n\nKid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal magazine, but though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, \"He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between.\"\n\nIn 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock's performances, and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs \"Somebody's Gotta Feel This\" and \"I Got One for Ya\", which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records. As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.\n\nBy this time, Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona and musical style and wanted to make a \"redneck, shit-kicking rock 'n' roll rap\" album, resulting in his fourth studio album, Devil Without a Cause, recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.\n\nThrough extensive promoting, including appearances on MTV (including a performance alongside Aerosmith and Run-DMC) and performing at Woodstock 1999, Devil Without a Cause sold 14 million copies, the album's success spurred by Kid Rock's breakthrough hit single \"Bawitdaba\".\n\nIn 2000, Kid Rock was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years. Kid Rock's success, however, was marked by tragedy, with the death of friend and collaborator Joe C.\n\nContinued success and shift away from hip hop (2001–2008)\n\nIn April 2001, Kid Rock made his acting debut in the comedy film Joe Dirt, starring David Spade.

In November, Kid Rock released his fifth studio album, Cocky. The album became a hit, spurred by the crossover success of the single \"Picture\", a country ballad featuring Sheryl Crow which introduced Kid Rock to a wider audience and was ultimately the most successful single on the album.\n\nIn support of the album, Kid Rock performed on the American Bad Ass Tour in 2001, supported by country singer David Allan Coe as an opening act; Coe's participation was criticized by journalist Neil Strauss: noting Kid Rock's hip hop background, Strauss alleged that Coe's songs were racist, and suggested that Coe's participation conflicted with Kid Rock's musical lineage. The same year, Kid Rock began displaying the Confederate flag during his live performances; in a 2002 interview with the Detroit Free Press, Kid Rock defended his use of the flag, saying that it was a symbol of Southern rock and rebellion. During this period, Uncle Kracker began his solo career.\n\nIn 2001, Kid Rock filed a lawsuit to gain full control over the Top Dog record label, resulting in his receiving full ownership of the label in 2003.\n\nIn 2002, Kid Rock covered ZZ Top's \"Legs\" to serve as WWE Diva Stacy Keibler's theme song; it also appeared on the album WWF Forceable Entry.

In July 2007, Kid Rock was featured in the cover of Rolling Stone magazine for the second time. The album's third single, \"All Summer Long\", became a global hit, utilizing a mash up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and Warren Zevon's \"Werewolves of London\".\n\nIn 2008, Kid Rock recorded and made a music video for the song \"Warrior\" for a National Guard advertising campaign.\n\nContinued recording and controversies (2010 onward)\n\nIn 2010, Kid Rock released his country-oriented eighth studio album, Born Free, produced by Rick Rubin, and featuring guest appearances by Sheryl Crow and Bob Seger.

During the ceremony, Kid Rock elaborated on his display of the flag, stating, \"[I] never flew the flag with hate in my heart [...] I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people.\" Kid Rock's publicist announced that 2011 was the year he officially distanced himself from the flag.\n\nThe following year, Kid Rock performed alongside Travie McCoy and The Roots in honor of the Beastie Boys, during the band's induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. 2012 also saw the release of Kid Rock's ninth studio album, Rebel Soul; he said that he wanted the album to feel like a greatest hits album, but with new songs.\n\nIn 2013, Kid Rock performed on the \"Best Night Ever\" tour, where he motioned to charge no more than $20 for his tickets. The following year, he moved to Warner Bros. Records, releasing his only album on the label, First Kiss, which he self-produced. Subsequently after leaving Warner Bros., Kid Rock signed with the country label Broken Bow Records.\n\nIn 2015, following the Charleston church shooting, the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network protested outside of the Detroit Historical Museum which honored Kid Rock; activists urged Kid Rock to renounce the Confederate flag. Kid Rock wrote an email to Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly, stating, \"Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass\". The same day, the National Action Network protested Chevrolet for sponsoring Kid Rock's tour.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, Kid Rock shared a photo of a \"Kid Rock for US Senate\" yard sign on Twitter.

Hockey player Jeremy Roenick praised the choice and condemned Kid Rock's critics, saying, \"Kid Rock is the most talented musician, I think ever, on the planet, because you can put any instrument in your hand or on your mouth and you can play anything and rock a house and sing any kind of genre.\"\n\nIt was also announced that, in March 2018, Kid Rock would perform on Lynyrd Skynyrd's final tour before the Southern rock band retired, alongside Hank Williams Jr., Bad Company, the Marshall Tucker Band and 38 Special.\n\nMusic style\n\nKid Rock's music is noted for its eclectic sound, which draws from genres such as hip hop,http://tasteofcountry.com/kid-rock-sweet-southern-sugar/ rap rock, heavy metal, rock and roll, Southern rock, country, blues, funk and soul.\n\nKid Rock's music has been described by Pitchfork as a cross between Run-DMC, Lynyrd Skynyrd and AC/DC.

With the recording of his follow-up album, The Polyfuze Method, Kid Rock began to feature more of a rap rock sound; the album served as a crossroads between his hip hop and rock career, still maintaining a strong hip hop sound, while beginning Kid Rock's use of rock and roll and country music influences.\n\nHis third album, Early Morning Stoned Pimp, featured what MTV described as \"a more eclectic collection of funk, rap, soul and rock\".
