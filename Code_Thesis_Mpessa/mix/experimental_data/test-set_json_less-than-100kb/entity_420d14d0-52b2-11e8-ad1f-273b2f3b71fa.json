The 17th century's account of Portuguese historian, Emanuel Godinho de Erédia, noted on the region of \"Malaios\" surrounded by the Andaman Sea in the north, the entire Malacca Strait in the centre, a part of Sunda Strait in the south, and the western part of South China Sea in the east.\n\nPrior to the foundation of Melaka, reference to Malay peninsula was made in different terms from various foreign sources.

Another Indian source, an inscription on the south wall of the Brihadeeswarar Temple, recorded the word Malaiur, referring to a kingdom in Malay peninsula that had \"a strong mountain for its rampart\".
