  "textBody" : "In physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.\n\nOverview\n\nThe most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.\n\nMeasurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.\n\nIn addition, there are also equations of state describing solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another. There are equations that model the interior of stars, including neutron stars, dense matter (quark–gluon plasmas) and radiation fields. A related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology.\n\nIn practical context, the equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculation in process engineering problems and especially in petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitting equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids, piping and sizing.\n\nHistorical \n\nBoyle's law (1662) \n\nBoyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:\n\n pV = \\mathrm{constant}.\\,\\! \n\nThe above relationship has also been attributed to Edme Mariotte and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.\n\nCharles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) \n\nIn 1787 the French physicist Jacques Charles found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:\n\n\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}.\n\nDalton's law of partial pressures (1801) \n\nDalton's Law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented for n species as:\n\n:\np_\\text{total} p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_n \n p_\\text{total} \\sum_{i\n1}^n p_i.\n\nThe ideal gas law (1834) \n\nIn 1834 Émile Clapeyron combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ideal gas law. Initially, the law was formulated as pVm R(TC + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where R is the gas constant. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0 °C \n 273.15 K, giving:\n\n\\ pV_m = R (T_C+273.15^\\circ C).\n\nVan der Waals equation of state (1873) \n\nIn 1873, J. D. van der Waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the Redlich–Kwong equation of state and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong.\n\nMajor equations of state \n\nFor a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form:\n\n{\\ f(p,V,T) = 0}.\n\nIn the following equations the variables are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although SI units are preferred. Absolute temperature refers to use of the Kelvin (K) or Rankine (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.\n\n\\ p = pressure (absolute)\n\\ V = volume\n\\ n = number of moles of a substance\n\\ V_m \\frac{V}{n} \n molar volume, the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid\n\\ T = absolute temperature\n\\ R = ideal gas constant (8.3144621 J/(mol·K))\n\\ p_c = pressure at the critical point\n\\ V_c = molar volume at the critical point\n\\ T_c = absolute temperature at the critical point\n\nClassical ideal gas law \n\nThe classical ideal gas law may be written:\n\n{\\ pV = nRT}.\n\nIn the form shown above, the equation of state is thus\n\nf(p, V, T) pV - nRT \n 0.\n\nIf the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\n\n{\\ p = \\rho (\\gamma-1)e}\n\nwhere \\rho  is the density, \\gamma C_p/C_v is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), e\nC_vT is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), C_v is the specific heat at constant volume, and C_p is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nCubic equations of state \n\nCubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of Vm.\n\nVan der Waals equation of state \n\nThe Van der Waals equation of state may be written:\n\n{\\left(p + \\frac{a}{V_m^2}\\right)\\left(V_m-b\\right) = RT}\n\nwhere V_m is molar volume. The substance-specific constants a and b can be calculated from the critical properties p_c, T_c and V_c (noting that V_c is the molar volume at the critical point) as:\n\na = 3p_c \\,V_c^2\nb = \\frac{V_c}{3}.\nAlso written as\na = \\frac{27(R\\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}\nb = \\frac{R\\,T_c}{8p_c}.\n\nProposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation a is called the attraction parameter and b the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.\n\nThe van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, \"improved\" due to two independent reasons:\n# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus V_m cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (V_m - b) instead of V_m.\n# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (p + something) instead of p. To evaluate this ‘something’, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~\\rho, the force acting on the whole element is ~\\rho^2~\\frac{1}{V_m^2}.\n\nWith the reduced state variables, i.e. VrVm/Vc, Pr\nP/Pc and Tr=T/Tc, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:\n\n{\\left(P_r + \\frac{3}{V_r^2}\\right)\\left(3V_r-1\\right) = 8T_r}\n\nThe benefit of this form is that for given Tr and Pr, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using Cardano's method for the reduced cubic form:\n\n{V_r^3-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+ \\frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\\right)V_r^2+\\frac{3V_r}{P_r}-\\frac{1}{P_r}=0}\n\nFor Prr{p = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}\\,V_m\\left(V_m+b\\right)}}\n\na = \\frac{0.42748\\,R^2\\,{T_c}^{5/2}}{p_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{p_c}\n\nIntroduced in 1949, the Redlich-Kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor–liquid equilibria. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.\n\nThe Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):\n\n\\frac{p}{p_c} \n\nSoave modification of Redlich-Kwong \n\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a\\,\\alpha}{V_m\\left(V_m+b\\right)}\n\na = \\frac{0.42747\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{P_c}\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.48508 + 1.55171\\,\\omega - 0.15613\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\nT_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}\n\nWhere ω is the acentric factor for the species.\n\nThis formulation for \\alpha is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:\n\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.480 + 1.574\\,\\omega - 0.176\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\nfor hydrogen:\n\n\\alpha = 1.202 \\exp\\left(-0.30288\\,T_r\\right).\n\nWe can also write it in the polynomial form, with:\n\nA = \\frac{a\\,\\alpha\\,P}{R^2\\,T^2} \nB = \\frac{b\\,P}{R\\,T}\nthen we have:\n0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\\left(A-B-B^2\\right)-AB \\;\nwhere R is the universal gas constant and Z=PV/(RT) is the compressibility factor.\n\nIn 1972 G. SoaveSoave, G. Equilibrium Constants from a Modified Redlich-Kwong Equation of\nState, Chem. Eng. Sci.,1 9 7 2, 27, 1197-1203 replaced the 1/√(T) term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the acentric factor (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.\n\nNote especially that this replacement changes the definition of a slightly, as the T_c is now to the second power.\n\nVolume translation of Peneloux et alios \n\nThe SRK EOS may be written as\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_{mSRK}-b} - \\frac{a}{V_{mSRK} \\left(V_{mSRK} +b\\right)}\n\nwhere\na = a_{c} \\, \\alpha \na_{c} = \\frac{0.42747\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{P_c}\n\nwhere \\alpha  and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.\n\nA downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982) proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation\n\nV_{mSRK} = V_{m} + c\n\nwhere c is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.\n\nIn the first version only V_{mSRK} is translated,\n and the EOS becomes\n\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m +c -b} - \\frac{a}{\\left(V_m +c\\right) \\left(V_m +c +b\\right)}\n\nIn the second version both V_{mSRK} and b_{SRK} are translated, or the translation of V_{mSRK} is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter b-c. This gives\n\nb_{SRK} = b + c \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b-c \\curvearrowright b\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m -b} - \\frac{a}{\\left(V_m +c\\right) \\left(V_m +2c +b\\right)}\n\nThe c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by\nc \\sum_{i\n1}^{n} z_{i}c_{i}\n\nThe c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation\n\nc_{i} = 0.40768 \\ \\frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \\left( 0.29441 - Z_{RAi}\\right) \n\nwhere the Rackett compressibility factor Z_{RAi} can be estimated by\n\nZ_{RAi} = 0.29056 - 0.08775 \\ \\omega_{i}\n\nA nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium \ncalculations. It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.\n\nPeng–Robinson equation of state \n\np=\\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a\\,\\alpha}{V_m^2+2bV_m-b^2}\n\na = \\frac{0.45724\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{p_c}\n\nb = \\frac{0.07780\\,R\\,T_c}{p_c}\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\kappa \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\n\\kappa = 0.37464 + 1.54226\\,\\omega - 0.26992\\,\\omega^2\n\nT_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}\n\nIn polynomial form:\n\nA = \\frac{\\alpha a p}{ R^2\\,T^2}\n\nB = \\frac{b p}{RT}\n\nZ^3 - (1-B)\\ Z^2 + (A-2B-3B^2)\\ Z -(AB-B^2-B^3) = 0 \\;\n\nwhere \\omega is the acentric factor of the species, R is the universal gas constant and Z=PV/nRT is compressibility factor.\n\nThe Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The University of Alberta by Ding-Yu Peng and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:\n# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the critical properties and the acentric factor.\n# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the compressibility factor and liquid density.\n# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature pressure and composition.\n# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.\n\nFor the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones. The departure functions of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.\n\nPeng–Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equations of state\n\nPRSV1\n\nA modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor.\n\nThe modification is:\n\\kappa = \\kappa_0 + \\kappa_1 \\left(1+T_r^{0.5}\\right) \\left(0.7-T_r\\right)\n\\kappa_0 = 0.378893+1.4897153\\,\\omega-0.17131848\\,\\omega^2+0.0196554\\,\\omega^3\n\nwhere \\,\\kappa_1 is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set \\,\\kappa_1 0  and simply use \\kappa \n \\kappa_0 . For alcohols and water the value of \\,\\kappa_1  may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.\n\nPRSV2\n\nA subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.\n\nThe modification is:\n\\kappa = \\kappa_0 + \\left[\\kappa_1+\\kappa_2\\left(\\kappa_3-T_r\\right)\\left(1-T_r^{0.5}\\right)\\right]\\left(1+T_r^{0.5}\\right) \\left(0.7-T_r\\right)\n\\kappa_0 = 0.378893+1.4897153\\,\\omega-0.17131848\\,\\omega^2+0.0196554\\,\\omega^3\n\nwhere \\,\\kappa_1, \\,\\kappa_2, and \\,\\kappa_3 are adjustable pure component parameters.\n\nPRSV2 is particularly advantageous for VLE calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\n\nOne thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.\n\nElliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state \n\nThe Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990. The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.\n\n\\frac{p V_m}{RT}Z\n1 + Z^{\\rm{rep}} + Z^{\\rm{att}}\n\nwhere:\n\nZ^{\\rm{rep}} = \\frac{4 c \\eta}{1-1.9 \\eta}\n\nZ^{\\rm{att}} = -\\frac{z_m q \\eta Y}{1+ k_1 \\eta Y}\n\nand\n\nc is a \"shape factor\", with c=1 for spherical molecules\nFor non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:\n\nc=1+3.535\\omega+0.533\\omega^2 where \\omega is the acentric factor\n\nThe reduced number density \\eta is defined as \\eta=\\frac{v^* n}{V}\nwhere\nv^* is the characteristic size parameter\nn is the number of molecules\nV is the volume of the container\nThe characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter c through\nv^*=\\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\\Phi\nwhere\n\n\\Phi=\\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2} and k is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nNoting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the Universal gas constant, and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of Avogadro's number and the molar mass, the reduced number density \\eta can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as\n\n\\eta=\\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\\Phi\\frac{1}{V_m}.\n\nThe shape parameter q appearing in the Attraction term and the term Y are given by\nq=1+k_3(c-1) (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).\n\nY=\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{kT}\\right) - k_2\n\nwhere \\epsilon is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by\n\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{k} =\\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}\n\nz_m, k_1, k_2 and k_3 are constants in the equation of state:\nz_m 9.49 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_1 1.7745 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_2 1.0617 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_3 = 1.90476.\n\nThe model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components.

This equation is also called the Kamerlingh Onnes equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. A is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient B corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, C to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients B, C, D, etc. are functions of temperature only.\n\nOne of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-StarlingStarling, Kenneth E., Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems, Gulf Publishing Company, p. 270 (1973). shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:\np=\\rho RT + \\left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \\frac{C_0}{T^2} + \\frac{D_0}{T^3} - \\frac{E_0}{T^4}\\right) \\rho^2 + \\left(bRT-a-\\frac{d}{T} + \\frac{c}{T^2}\\right) \\rho^3 + \\alpha\\left(a+\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^6 \n\nNote that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.\n\nThe BWR equation of state \n\np=\\rho RT + \\left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \\frac{C_0}{T^2} + \\frac{D_0}{T^3} - \\frac{E_0}{T^4}\\right) \\rho^2 + \\left(bRT-a-\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^3 + \\alpha\\left(a+\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^6 + \\frac{c\\rho^3}{T^2}\\left(1 + \\gamma\\rho^2\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\gamma\\rho^2\\right)\n\nwhere\np = pressure\nρ = molar density\n\nValues of the various parameters for 15 substances can be found in \n\nSAFT equations of state \n\nStatistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) equations of state use statistical mechanical methods (in particular perturbation theory) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.Chapman, Walter G., et al. \"SAFT: Equation-of-state solution model for associating fluids.\" Fluid Phase Equilibria 52 (1989): 31-38. The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989, but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed.Gil-Villegas A, Galindo A, Whitehead PJ, Mills SJ, Jackson G, Burgess AN. Statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range. The Journal of chemical physics. 1997 Mar 8;106(10):4168-86. Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another. One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments (PC-SAFT).Gross J, Sadowski G. Perturbed-chain SAFT: An equation of state based on a perturbation theory for chain molecules. Industrial & engineering chemistry research. 2001 Feb 21;40(4):1244-60. In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.Gross J, Sadowski G. Application of the perturbed-chain SAFT equation of state to associating systems. Industrial & engineering chemistry research. 2002 Oct 30;41(22):5510-5.Saajanlehto M, Uusi-Kyyny P, Alopaeus V.

Fluid Phase Equilibria. 2014 Nov 25;382:150-7.\n\nMultiparameter equations of state \n\nHelmholtz Function form \n\nMultiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:\n\n \\frac{a(T,\\rho)}{RT} = \n\\frac{a^o(T,\\rho)+a^r(T,\\rho)}{RT}=\n\\alpha^o(\\tau,\\delta)+\n\\alpha^r(\\tau,\\delta)\n\nWhere:\n\n \\tau \\frac{T_r}{T},    \\delta \n \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_r} \n\nThe reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.\nOther thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms.\nTypical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.\n\nOther equations of state of interest \n\nStiffened equation of state\n\nWhen considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions, sonic shock lithotripsy, and sonoluminescence, the stiffened equation of state is often used:\n\n p=\\rho(\\gamma-1)e-\\gamma p^0 \\,\n\nwhere e is the internal energy per unit mass, \\gamma is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and p^0 is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).\n\nThe equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by c^2=\\gamma(p+p^0)/\\rho.\n\nThus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is already under about 20,000 atmospheres (2 GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100 kPa to 200 kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1 MPa to 2000.2 MPa).\n\nThis equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.\n\nUltrarelativistic equation of state\n\nAn ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state\n\np=\\rho_m c_s^2\n\nwhere p is the pressure, \\rho_m is the mass density, and c_s is the speed of sound.\n\nIdeal Bose equation of state\n\nThe equation of state for an ideal Bose gas is\n\npV_m=RT~\\frac{\\textrm{Li}_{\\alpha+1}(z)}{\\zeta(\\alpha)}\n\\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^\\alpha\n\nwhere α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field,\nα=3/2), z is exp(μ/kT) where μ is the chemical potential, Li is the \npolylogarithm, ζ is the Riemann zeta function, and Tc is the\ncritical temperature at which a Bose–Einstein condensate begins to form.\n\nJones–Wilkins–Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)\n\nThe equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.\n\n p=A \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_1 \\cdot V} \\right)  \\cdot \\exp (-R_1 \\cdot V) + B \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_2 \\cdot V} \\right) \\cdot \\exp (-R_2 \\cdot V) + \\frac{\\omega \\cdot e_0}{V} \n\nThe ratio  V \\rho_{e} / \\rho  is defined by using  \\rho_e  \n density of the explosive (solid part) and  \\rho  density of the detonation products. The parameters  A ,  B ,  R_1 ,  R_2  and  \\omega  are given by several references. In addition, the initial density (solid part)  \\rho_0 , speed of detonation  V_D , Chapman–Jouguet pressure  P_{CJ}  and the chemical energy of the explosive  e_0  are given in such references.

    "aggregatedText" : "In physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.\n\nOverview\n\nThe most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.\n\nMeasurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.\n\nIn addition, there are also equations of state describing solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another. There are equations that model the interior of stars, including neutron stars, dense matter (quark–gluon plasmas) and radiation fields. A related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology.\n\nIn practical context, the equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculation in process engineering problems and especially in petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitting equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids, piping and sizing.\n\nHistorical \n\nBoyle's law (1662) \n\nBoyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:\n\n pV = \\mathrm{constant}.\\,\\! \n\nThe above relationship has also been attributed to Edme Mariotte and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.\n\nCharles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) \n\nIn 1787 the French physicist Jacques Charles found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:\n\n\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}.\n\nDalton's law of partial pressures (1801) \n\nDalton's Law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented for n species as:\n\n:\np_\\text{total} p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_n \n p_\\text{total} \\sum_{i\n1}^n p_i.\n\nThe ideal gas law (1834) \n\nIn 1834 Émile Clapeyron combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ideal gas law. Initially, the law was formulated as pVm R(TC + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where R is the gas constant. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0 °C \n 273.15 K, giving:\n\n\\ pV_m = R (T_C+273.15^\\circ C).\n\nVan der Waals equation of state (1873) \n\nIn 1873, J. D. van der Waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the Redlich–Kwong equation of state and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong.\n\nMajor equations of state \n\nFor a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form:\n\n{\\ f(p,V,T) = 0}.\n\nIn the following equations the variables are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although SI units are preferred. Absolute temperature refers to use of the Kelvin (K) or Rankine (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.\n\n\\ p = pressure (absolute)\n\\ V = volume\n\\ n = number of moles of a substance\n\\ V_m \\frac{V}{n} \n molar volume, the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid\n\\ T = absolute temperature\n\\ R = ideal gas constant (8.3144621 J/(mol·K))\n\\ p_c = pressure at the critical point\n\\ V_c = molar volume at the critical point\n\\ T_c = absolute temperature at the critical point\n\nClassical ideal gas law \n\nThe classical ideal gas law may be written:\n\n{\\ pV = nRT}.\n\nIn the form shown above, the equation of state is thus\n\nf(p, V, T) pV - nRT \n 0.\n\nIf the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\n\n{\\ p = \\rho (\\gamma-1)e}\n\nwhere \\rho  is the density, \\gamma C_p/C_v is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), e\nC_vT is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), C_v is the specific heat at constant volume, and C_p is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nCubic equations of state \n\nCubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of Vm.\n\nVan der Waals equation of state \n\nThe Van der Waals equation of state may be written:\n\n{\\left(p + \\frac{a}{V_m^2}\\right)\\left(V_m-b\\right) = RT}\n\nwhere V_m is molar volume. The substance-specific constants a and b can be calculated from the critical properties p_c, T_c and V_c (noting that V_c is the molar volume at the critical point) as:\n\na = 3p_c \\,V_c^2\nb = \\frac{V_c}{3}.\nAlso written as\na = \\frac{27(R\\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}\nb = \\frac{R\\,T_c}{8p_c}.\n\nProposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation a is called the attraction parameter and b the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.\n\nThe van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, \"improved\" due to two independent reasons:\n# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus V_m cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (V_m - b) instead of V_m.\n# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (p + something) instead of p. To evaluate this ‘something’, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~\\rho, the force acting on the whole element is ~\\rho^2~\\frac{1}{V_m^2}.\n\nWith the reduced state variables, i.e. VrVm/Vc, Pr\nP/Pc and Tr=T/Tc, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:\n\n{\\left(P_r + \\frac{3}{V_r^2}\\right)\\left(3V_r-1\\right) = 8T_r}\n\nThe benefit of this form is that for given Tr and Pr, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using Cardano's method for the reduced cubic form:\n\n{V_r^3-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+ \\frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\\right)V_r^2+\\frac{3V_r}{P_r}-\\frac{1}{P_r}=0}\n\nFor Prr{p = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}\\,V_m\\left(V_m+b\\right)}}\n\na = \\frac{0.42748\\,R^2\\,{T_c}^{5/2}}{p_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{p_c}\n\nIntroduced in 1949, the Redlich-Kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor–liquid equilibria. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.\n\nThe Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):\n\n\\frac{p}{p_c} \n\nSoave modification of Redlich-Kwong \n\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a\\,\\alpha}{V_m\\left(V_m+b\\right)}\n\na = \\frac{0.42747\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{P_c}\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.48508 + 1.55171\\,\\omega - 0.15613\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\nT_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}\n\nWhere ω is the acentric factor for the species.\n\nThis formulation for \\alpha is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:\n\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.480 + 1.574\\,\\omega - 0.176\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\nfor hydrogen:\n\n\\alpha = 1.202 \\exp\\left(-0.30288\\,T_r\\right).\n\nWe can also write it in the polynomial form, with:\n\nA = \\frac{a\\,\\alpha\\,P}{R^2\\,T^2} \nB = \\frac{b\\,P}{R\\,T}\nthen we have:\n0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\\left(A-B-B^2\\right)-AB \\;\nwhere R is the universal gas constant and Z=PV/(RT) is the compressibility factor.\n\nIn 1972 G. SoaveSoave, G. Equilibrium Constants from a Modified Redlich-Kwong Equation of\nState, Chem. Eng. Sci.,1 9 7 2, 27, 1197-1203 replaced the 1/√(T) term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the acentric factor (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.\n\nNote especially that this replacement changes the definition of a slightly, as the T_c is now to the second power.\n\nVolume translation of Peneloux et alios \n\nThe SRK EOS may be written as\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_{mSRK}-b} - \\frac{a}{V_{mSRK} \\left(V_{mSRK} +b\\right)}\n\nwhere\na = a_{c} \\, \\alpha \na_{c} = \\frac{0.42747\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c}\nb = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{P_c}\n\nwhere \\alpha  and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.\n\nA downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982) proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation\n\nV_{mSRK} = V_{m} + c\n\nwhere c is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.\n\nIn the first version only V_{mSRK} is translated,\n and the EOS becomes\n\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m +c -b} - \\frac{a}{\\left(V_m +c\\right) \\left(V_m +c +b\\right)}\n\nIn the second version both V_{mSRK} and b_{SRK} are translated, or the translation of V_{mSRK} is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter b-c. This gives\n\nb_{SRK} = b + c \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b-c \\curvearrowright b\np = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m -b} - \\frac{a}{\\left(V_m +c\\right) \\left(V_m +2c +b\\right)}\n\nThe c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by\nc \\sum_{i\n1}^{n} z_{i}c_{i}\n\nThe c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation\n\nc_{i} = 0.40768 \\ \\frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \\left( 0.29441 - Z_{RAi}\\right) \n\nwhere the Rackett compressibility factor Z_{RAi} can be estimated by\n\nZ_{RAi} = 0.29056 - 0.08775 \\ \\omega_{i}\n\nA nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium \ncalculations. It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.\n\nPeng–Robinson equation of state \n\np=\\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a\\,\\alpha}{V_m^2+2bV_m-b^2}\n\na = \\frac{0.45724\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{p_c}\n\nb = \\frac{0.07780\\,R\\,T_c}{p_c}\n\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\kappa \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2\n\n\\kappa = 0.37464 + 1.54226\\,\\omega - 0.26992\\,\\omega^2\n\nT_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}\n\nIn polynomial form:\n\nA = \\frac{\\alpha a p}{ R^2\\,T^2}\n\nB = \\frac{b p}{RT}\n\nZ^3 - (1-B)\\ Z^2 + (A-2B-3B^2)\\ Z -(AB-B^2-B^3) = 0 \\;\n\nwhere \\omega is the acentric factor of the species, R is the universal gas constant and Z=PV/nRT is compressibility factor.\n\nThe Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The University of Alberta by Ding-Yu Peng and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:\n# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the critical properties and the acentric factor.\n# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the compressibility factor and liquid density.\n# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature pressure and composition.\n# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.\n\nFor the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones. The departure functions of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.\n\nPeng–Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equations of state\n\nPRSV1\n\nA modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor.\n\nThe modification is:\n\\kappa = \\kappa_0 + \\kappa_1 \\left(1+T_r^{0.5}\\right) \\left(0.7-T_r\\right)\n\\kappa_0 = 0.378893+1.4897153\\,\\omega-0.17131848\\,\\omega^2+0.0196554\\,\\omega^3\n\nwhere \\,\\kappa_1 is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set \\,\\kappa_1 0  and simply use \\kappa \n \\kappa_0 . For alcohols and water the value of \\,\\kappa_1  may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.\n\nPRSV2\n\nA subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.\n\nThe modification is:\n\\kappa = \\kappa_0 + \\left[\\kappa_1+\\kappa_2\\left(\\kappa_3-T_r\\right)\\left(1-T_r^{0.5}\\right)\\right]\\left(1+T_r^{0.5}\\right) \\left(0.7-T_r\\right)\n\\kappa_0 = 0.378893+1.4897153\\,\\omega-0.17131848\\,\\omega^2+0.0196554\\,\\omega^3\n\nwhere \\,\\kappa_1, \\,\\kappa_2, and \\,\\kappa_3 are adjustable pure component parameters.\n\nPRSV2 is particularly advantageous for VLE calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\n\nOne thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.\n\nElliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state \n\nThe Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990. The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.\n\n\\frac{p V_m}{RT}Z\n1 + Z^{\\rm{rep}} + Z^{\\rm{att}}\n\nwhere:\n\nZ^{\\rm{rep}} = \\frac{4 c \\eta}{1-1.9 \\eta}\n\nZ^{\\rm{att}} = -\\frac{z_m q \\eta Y}{1+ k_1 \\eta Y}\n\nand\n\nc is a \"shape factor\", with c=1 for spherical molecules\nFor non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:\n\nc=1+3.535\\omega+0.533\\omega^2 where \\omega is the acentric factor\n\nThe reduced number density \\eta is defined as \\eta=\\frac{v^* n}{V}\nwhere\nv^* is the characteristic size parameter\nn is the number of molecules\nV is the volume of the container\nThe characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter c through\nv^*=\\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\\Phi\nwhere\n\n\\Phi=\\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2} and k is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nNoting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the Universal gas constant, and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of Avogadro's number and the molar mass, the reduced number density \\eta can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as\n\n\\eta=\\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\\Phi\\frac{1}{V_m}.\n\nThe shape parameter q appearing in the Attraction term and the term Y are given by\nq=1+k_3(c-1) (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).\n\nY=\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{kT}\\right) - k_2\n\nwhere \\epsilon is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by\n\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{k} =\\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}\n\nz_m, k_1, k_2 and k_3 are constants in the equation of state:\nz_m 9.49 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_1 1.7745 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_2 1.0617 for spherical molecules (c\n1)\nk_3 = 1.90476.\n\nThe model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components.

This equation is also called the Kamerlingh Onnes equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. A is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient B corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, C to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients B, C, D, etc. are functions of temperature only.\n\nOne of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-StarlingStarling, Kenneth E., Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems, Gulf Publishing Company, p. 270 (1973). shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:\np=\\rho RT + \\left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \\frac{C_0}{T^2} + \\frac{D_0}{T^3} - \\frac{E_0}{T^4}\\right) \\rho^2 + \\left(bRT-a-\\frac{d}{T} + \\frac{c}{T^2}\\right) \\rho^3 + \\alpha\\left(a+\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^6 \n\nNote that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.\n\nThe BWR equation of state \n\np=\\rho RT + \\left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \\frac{C_0}{T^2} + \\frac{D_0}{T^3} - \\frac{E_0}{T^4}\\right) \\rho^2 + \\left(bRT-a-\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^3 + \\alpha\\left(a+\\frac{d}{T}\\right) \\rho^6 + \\frac{c\\rho^3}{T^2}\\left(1 + \\gamma\\rho^2\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\gamma\\rho^2\\right)\n\nwhere\np = pressure\nρ = molar density\n\nValues of the various parameters for 15 substances can be found in \n\nSAFT equations of state \n\nStatistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) equations of state use statistical mechanical methods (in particular perturbation theory) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.Chapman, Walter G., et al. \"SAFT: Equation-of-state solution model for associating fluids.\" Fluid Phase Equilibria 52 (1989): 31-38. The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989, but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed.Gil-Villegas A, Galindo A, Whitehead PJ, Mills SJ, Jackson G, Burgess AN. Statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range. The Journal of chemical physics. 1997 Mar 8;106(10):4168-86. Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another. One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments (PC-SAFT).Gross J, Sadowski G. Perturbed-chain SAFT: An equation of state based on a perturbation theory for chain molecules. Industrial & engineering chemistry research. 2001 Feb 21;40(4):1244-60. In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.Gross J, Sadowski G. Application of the perturbed-chain SAFT equation of state to associating systems. Industrial & engineering chemistry research. 2002 Oct 30;41(22):5510-5.Saajanlehto M, Uusi-Kyyny P, Alopaeus V. A modified continuous flow apparatus for gas solubility measurements at high pressure and temperature with camera system. Fluid Phase Equilibria. 2014 Nov 25;382:150-7.\n\nMultiparameter equations of state \n\nHelmholtz Function form \n\nMultiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:\n\n \\frac{a(T,\\rho)}{RT} = \n\\frac{a^o(T,\\rho)+a^r(T,\\rho)}{RT}=\n\\alpha^o(\\tau,\\delta)+\n\\alpha^r(\\tau,\\delta)\n\nWhere:\n\n \\tau \\frac{T_r}{T},    \\delta \n \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_r} \n\nThe reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.\nOther thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms.\nTypical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.\n\nOther equations of state of interest \n\nStiffened equation of state\n\nWhen considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions, sonic shock lithotripsy, and sonoluminescence, the stiffened equation of state is often used:\n\n p=\\rho(\\gamma-1)e-\\gamma p^0 \\,\n\nwhere e is the internal energy per unit mass, \\gamma is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and p^0 is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).\n\nThe equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by c^2=\\gamma(p+p^0)/\\rho.\n\nThus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is already under about 20,000 atmospheres (2 GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100 kPa to 200 kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1 MPa to 2000.2 MPa).\n\nThis equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.\n\nUltrarelativistic equation of state\n\nAn ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state\n\np=\\rho_m c_s^2\n\nwhere p is the pressure, \\rho_m is the mass density, and c_s is the speed of sound.\n\nIdeal Bose equation of state\n\nThe equation of state for an ideal Bose gas is\n\npV_m=RT~\\frac{\\textrm{Li}_{\\alpha+1}(z)}{\\zeta(\\alpha)}\n\\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^\\alpha\n\nwhere α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field,\nα=3/2), z is exp(μ/kT) where μ is the chemical potential, Li is the \npolylogarithm, ζ is the Riemann zeta function, and Tc is the\ncritical temperature at which a Bose–Einstein condensate begins to form.\n\nJones–Wilkins–Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)\n\nThe equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.\n\n p=A \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_1 \\cdot V} \\right)  \\cdot \\exp (-R_1 \\cdot V) + B \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_2 \\cdot V} \\right) \\cdot \\exp (-R_2 \\cdot V) + \\frac{\\omega \\cdot e_0}{V} \n\nThe ratio  V \\rho_{e} / \\rho  is defined by using  \\rho_e  \n density of the explosive (solid part) and  \\rho  density of the detonation products. The parameters  A ,  B ,  R_1 ,  R_2  and  \\omega  are given by several references. In addition, the initial density (solid part)  \\rho_0 , speed of detonation  V_D , Chapman–Jouguet pressure  P_{CJ}  and the chemical energy of the explosive  e_0  are given in such references. These parameters are obtained by fitting the JWL-EOS to experimental results.  Typical parameters for some explosives are listed in the table below.\n\nEquations of state for solids and liquids \n\nCommon abbreviations:                          \n\\eta:(V/V_0)^{1/3}~,~~ K_0^\\prime :\n \\frac{dK_0}{dp}\n\n* Tait equation for water and other liquids.
