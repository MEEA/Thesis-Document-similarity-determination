Umako was the son of Soga Iname no Sukune, and therefore, he would have been one of Emperor Yōmei's cousins.\n\n* 585: In the 14th year of Bidatsu-tennō 's reign (敏達天皇14年), he died; and the succession (senso) was received by his younger brother.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōmei is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, p. 37; Brown, pp. 263; Varley, p. 44; n.b., A distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō,  Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.\n\nYōmei's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably Sumeramikoto or Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi (治天下大王), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven.\"  Alternatively, Yōmei might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the \"Great King of Yamato.\"\n\nEmperor Yōmei's reign lasted only two years; and he died at the age of 69.Varley, H.

Jinnō Shōtōki,  p. 126.\n\n* 587, in the 4th month: Yōmei died and his body was placed in a coffin, but not buried.\n* 587, in the 5th month: Armed conflict over the succession erupted.  Shintoist, anti-Buddhist forces of Yuge no  Moriya no Muraji (also known as Ō-muraji Yuge no Moriya) battled unsuccessfully against the pro-Buddhist forces of Prince Shōtoku and Soga Umako no Sukune.  The opposition to Buddhism was entirely destroyed.Brown, pp. 262–263.\n* 587, in the 7th month: The body of former Emperor Yōmei was buried.\n\nBecause of the brevity of his reign, Emperor Yōmei was not responsible for any radical changes in policy, but his support of Buddhism created tension with supporters of Shintoism who opposed its introduction. According to Nihon Shoki, Emperor Yomei believed both in Buddhism and Shintoism. Moriya, the most influential supporter of Shintoism, conspired with Emperor Yōmei's brother, Prince Anahobe, and after Emperor Yomei's death they made an abortive attempt to seize the throne. Although Emperor Yōmei is reported to have died from illness, this incident and the brevity of his reign have led some to speculate that he was actually assassinated by Moriya and Prince Anahobe.\n\nThe actual site of Yōmei's grave is  known.
