  "textBody" : "Ketoprofen, (RS)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid (chemical formula C16H14O3) is one of the propionic acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects. It acts by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin.\n\nAs of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 50 to 100 USD.\n\nMedical uses\n\nKetoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums.\n\nKetoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.\n\nKetoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.\n\nEfficacy\n\nA systematic review indicated \"The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac.\" A Cochrane systematic review investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.\n\nThere is evidence for topic ketoprofen for osteoarthritis but not other chronic musculoskeletal pain.\n\nInteractions\n\nKetoprofen should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as this increases the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration.  It should also be used with caution with other anticoagulants.  It is commonly used with omeprazole, sucralfate, and cimetidine to help protect the GI tract.\n\nMechanism\n\nThe patches have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration. Ketoprofen undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring, and reduction of its keto function.Ketoprofen. (n.d.).

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2008.  Ketoprofen is used for its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors.Ketoprofen. (n.d.). Micromedex. Retrieved February 1, 2010, from https://bb-tuc.touro.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab_id\n_102_1\n\nAvailable forms\n\nKetoprofen was available over-the-counter in the United States in the form of 12.5 mg coated tablets (Orudis KT and Actron), but this form has been discontinued. It is available by prescription capsules.\n\nKetoprofen is also available as a 2.5% gel for topical application, and it is also available as a patch for topical analgesia and anti-inflammatory action. However, the gel is not sold in the United States.\n\nBrand names in Australia are Orudis and Oruvail. It is available in Japan in a transdermal patch Mohrus Tape, made by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.  It is available in the UK as Ketoflam and Oruvail, in Ireland as Fastum Gel, in Estonia as Keto, Ketonal, and Fastum Gel, in Finland as Ketorin, Keto, Ketomex, and Orudis; in France as Profénid, Bi-Profénid and Ketum; in Italy as Ketodol, Fastum Gel, Lasonil, Orudis and Oki; in Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia as Knavon and Ketonal; in Romania as Ketonal and Fastum Gel; in Mexico as Arthril; in Norway as Zon and Orudis; in Russia as ОКИ (OKI), Fastum Gel and Ketonal; in Spain as Actron and Fastum Gel; and in Venezuela as Ketoprofeno under an injectable solution of 100 mg and 150 mg capsules.\n\nIn Lithuania, ketoprofen is called Ketoprofenum and Ketoprofenas.  For topical application: the name brands are Fastum with 2.5% (gel) which is over the counter, and Ketospray with 10% (liquid spray), which must be prescribed. In Switzerland, an innovative ketoprofen formulation based on transfersome technology for direct application on the skin above the site to be treated has been approved.\n\nIn some countries, the optically pure (S)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its trometamol salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.\n\nThe earliest report of therapeutic use in humans was in 1972.\n\nVeterinary medicine\n\nKetoprofen is a common NSAID, antipyretic, and analgesic used in horses and other equines.Forney, Barbara C, MS, VMD.  Equine Medications, Revised Edition. Blood Horse Publications. Lexington, KY. Copyright 2007. It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis. It is also used to control fevers and prevent endotoxemia. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.\n\nIn horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to phenylbutazone as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use.Owens JG, Kamerling SG, Keowen ML. Anti-inflammatory effects and pharmacokinetics of ketoprofen in a model of equine synovitis, in Proceedings. 6th Int Cong Eur Assoc\nVet Pharmacol Toxicol 1994;170–171. In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.Owens JG, Kamerling SG, Stanton SR, et al. Effects of pretreatment with ketoprofen and phenylbutazone on experi-\nmentally induced synovitis in dogs. 866 – 872.\n\nAdministration\n\nKetoprofen, when administered intravenously, is recommended for a maximum of five days of use.  Its analgesic and antipyretic effects begin to occur one to two hours following administration.  The most common dosage is 1 mg/ lb, once per day, although this dosage may be lowered for ponies, which are most susceptible to NSAID side effects.  \nIt is also available as a capsule dosage form and a tablet.\n\nEcological problems\n\nExperiments have found ketoprofen, like diclofenac, is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock suffer acute kidney failure within days of exposure.",
