  "textBody" : "is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana, kanji, and in some cases rōmaji (Latin script). It is a phonetic lettering system. The word hiragana literally means \"ordinary\" or \"simple\" kana (\"simple\" originally as contrasted with kanji).http://daijirin.dual-d.net/extra/hiragana.html「平」とは平凡な、やさしいという意で、当時普通に使用する文字体系であったことを意味する。 漢字は書簡文や重要な文章などを書く場合に用いる公的な文字であるのに対して、 平仮名は漢字の知識に乏しい人々などが用いる私的な性格のものであった。Translation: 平 [the \"hira\" part of \"hiragana\"] means \"ordinary\" or \"simple\" since at that time [the time that the name was given] it was a writing system for everyday use. While kanji was the official system used for letter-writing and important texts, hiragana was for personal use by people who had limited knowledge of kanji.\n\nHiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language (strictly, each mora) is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be either a vowel such as \"a\" (hiragana あ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as \"ka\" (か); or \"n\" (ん), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng, or like the nasal vowels of French. Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of ん \"n\"), the kana are referred to as syllabaries and not alphabets.\n\nHiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Words that do have common kanji renditions may also sometimes be written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference, for example to impart an informal feel. Hiragana is also used to write furigana, a reading aid that shows the pronunciation of kanji characters.\n\nThere are two main systems of ordering hiragana: the old-fashioned iroha ordering and the more prevalent gojūon ordering.\n\nWriting system\n\nThe modern hiragana syllabary consists of 46 base characters:\n* 5 singular vowels\n* 40 consonant–vowel unions\n* 1 singular consonant\n\nThese are conceived as a 5×10 grid (gojūon, , \"Fifty Sounds\"), as illustrated in the adjacent table, read           and so forth, with the singular consonant  appended to the end. Of the 50 theoretically possible combinations, yi and wu do not exist in the language, and ye, wi and we are obsolete (or virtually obsolete) in modern Japanese. wo is usually pronounced as a vowel (o) in modern Japanese, and is preserved in only one use, as a particle.\n\nRomanization of the kana does not always strictly follow the consonant-vowel scheme laid out in the table. For example, ち, nominally ti, is very often romanised as chi in an attempt to better represent the actual sound in Japanese.\n\nThese basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a dakuten marker ( ゛), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant: k→g, ts/s→z, t→d, h→b and ch/sh→j. For example, か (ka) becomes が (ga). Hiragana beginning with an h can also add a handakuten marker ( ゜) changing the h to a p. For example, は (ha) becomes ぱ (pa).\n\nA small version of the hiragana for ya, yu, or yo (ゃ, ゅ or ょ respectively) may be added to hiragana ending in i. This changes the i vowel sound to a glide (palatalization) to a, u or o. For example, き (ki) plus ゃ (small ya) becomes  (kya). Addition of the small y kana is called yōon. \n\nA small tsu っ, called a sokuon, indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation; for example, compare  saka \"hill\" with  sakka \"author\". The sokuon also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop, as in  ( Ouch!).  However, it cannot be used to double the na, ni, nu, ne, no syllables' consonants – to double these, the singular n (ん) is added in front of the syllable, as in みんな (minna, \"all\").\n\nHiragana usually spells long vowels with the addition of a second vowel kana; for example, おかあさん (o-ka-a-sa-n, \"mother\"). The chōonpu (long vowel mark) (ー) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word , rāmen, but this usage is considered non-standard in Japanese; the Okinawan language uses chōonpu with hiragana. In informal writing, small versions of the five vowel kana are sometimes used to represent trailing off sounds ( haa,  nee). Standard and voiced iteration marks are written in hiragana as ゝ and ゞ respectively.\n\nTable of hiragana\n\nThe following table shows the complete hiragana together with the Hepburn romanization and IPA transcription in the gojūon order. Hiragana with dakuten or handakuten follow the gojūon kana without them, with the yōon kana following. Obsolete and normally unused kana are shown in gray. For all syllables besides ん, the pronunciation indicated is for word-initial syllables, for mid-word pronunciations see below.\n\nIn the middle of words, the g sound (normally) often turns into a velar nasal and less often (although increasing recently) into the voiced velar fricative. An exception to this is numerals; 15 juugo is considered to be one word, but is pronounced as if it was jū and go stacked end to end:.\n\nAdditionally, the j sound (normally) can be pronounced in the middle of words. For example,  sūji 'number'.\n\nIn archaic forms of Japanese, there existed the kwa () and gwa () digraphs. In modern Japanese, these phonemes have been phased out of usage and only exist in the extended katakana digraphs for approximating foreign language words.\n\nThe singular n is pronounced before t, ch, ts, n, r, z, j and d, before m, b and p, before k and g, at the end of utterances, and some kind of high nasal vowel before vowels, palatal approximants (y), fricative consonants s, sh, h, f and w.\n\nIn kanji readings, the diphthongs ou and ei are today usually pronounced (long o) and (long e) respectively. For example,  (lit. toukyou) is pronounced 'Tokyo', and  sensei is 'teacher'. However,  tou is pronounced 'to inquire', because the o and u are considered distinct, u being the infinitive verb ending. Similarly,  shite iru is pronounced 'is doing'.\n\nFor a more thorough discussion on the sounds of Japanese, please refer to Japanese phonology.\n\nSpelling rules\n\nWith a few exceptions for sentence particles は, を, and へ (normally ha, wo, and he, but instead pronounced as wa, o, and e, respectively), and a few other arbitrary rules, Japanese, when written in kana, is phonemically orthographic, i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between kana characters and sounds, leaving only words' pitch accent unrepresented. This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as historical kana usage, differed substantially from pronunciation; the three above-mentioned exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system.\n\nThere are two hiragana pronounced ji (じ and ぢ) and two hiragana pronounced zu (ず and づ), but to distinguish them, particularly when typing Japanese, sometimes ぢ is written as di and づ is written as du.  These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, ji is written as じ and zu is written as ず. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a dakuten and the same syllable with a dakuten, the same hiragana is used to write the sounds.  For example, chijimeru ('to boil down' or 'to shrink') is spelled ちぢめる and tsuzuku ('to continue') is . For compound words where the dakuten reflects rendaku voicing, the original hiragana is used. For example, chi ( 'blood') is spelled ち in plain hiragana. When  hana ('nose') and  chi ('blood') combine to make hanaji ( 'nose bleed'), the sound of  changes from chi to ji.  So hanaji is spelled  according to ち: the basic hiragana used to transcribe . Similarly, tsukau (; 'to use') is spelled  in hiragana, so kanazukai (; 'kana use', or 'kana orthography') is spelled  in hiragana.\n\nHowever, this does not apply when kanji are used phonetically to write words that do not relate directly to the meaning of the kanji (see also ateji).  The Japanese word for 'lightning', for example, is inazuma ().  The  component means 'rice plant', is written  in hiragana and is pronounced: ina.  The  component means 'wife' and is pronounced tsuma (つま) when written in isolation—or frequently as zuma  when it features after another syllable. Neither of these components have anything to do with 'lightning', but together they do when they compose the word for 'lightning'. In this case, the default spelling in hiragana  rather than  is used.\n\nOfficially, ぢ and づ do not occur word-initially pursuant to modern spelling rules. There were words such as  jiban 'ground' in the historical kana usage, but they were unified under じ in the modern kana usage in 1946, so today it is spelled exclusively . However,  zura 'wig' (from  katsura) and  zuke (a sushi term for lean tuna soaked in soy sauce) are examples of word-initial づ today. Some people write the word for hemorrhoids as ぢ (normally じ) for emphasis.\n\nNo standard Japanese words begin with the kana ん (n). This is the basis of the word game shiritori. ん n is normally treated as its own syllable and is separate from the other n-based kana (na, ni etc.). A notable exception to this is the colloquial negative verb conjugation; for example  wakaranai meaning \"[I] don't understand\" is rendered as  wakaran. It is however not a contraction of the former, but instead comes from the classic negative verb conjugation ぬ nu ( wakaranu).\n\nん is sometimes directly followed by a vowel (a, i, u, e or o) or a palatal approximant (ya, yu or yo). These are clearly distinct from the na, ni etc. syllables, and there are minimal pairs such as  kin'en 'smoking forbidden',  kinen 'commemoration',  kinnen 'recent years'. In Hepburn romanization, they are distinguished with an apostrophe, but not all romanization methods make the distinction. For example, past prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's first name is actually  Jun'ichirō pronounced\n\nThere are a few hiragana that are rarely used. ゐ wi and ゑ we are obsolete outside of Okinawan orthography. 𛀁 e was an alternate version of え e before spelling reform, and was briefly reused for ye during initial spelling reforms, but is now completely obsolete. ゔ vu  is a modern addition used to represent the /v/ sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese from a phonological standpoint does not have a /v/ sound, it is pronounced as /b/ and mostly serves as a more accurate indicator of a word's pronunciation in its original language. However, it is rarely seen because loanwords and transliterated words are usually written in katakana, where the corresponding character would be written as ヴ. , ,  for ja/ju/jo are theoretically possible in rendaku, but are practically never used. For example,  'throughout Japan' could be written , but is practically always \n\nThe  myu kana is extremely rare in originally Japanese words; linguist Haruhiko Kindaichi raises the example of the Japanese family name Omamyūda  and claims it is the only occurrence amongst pure Japanese words. Its katakana counterpart is used in many loanwords, however.\n\nHistory\n\nHiragana developed from man'yōgana, Chinese characters used for their pronunciations, a practice that started in the 5th century.Yookoso! An Invitation to Contemporary Japanese 1st edition McGraw-Hill, page 13 \"Linguistic Note: The Origins of Hiragana and Katakana\" The oldest examples of Man'yōgana include the Inariyama Sword, an iron sword excavated at the Inariyama Kofun in 1968. This sword is thought to be made in year of  (which is A.D. 471 in commonly accepted theory).Seeley (2000:19-23)\nThe forms of the hiragana originate from the cursive script style of Chinese calligraphy. The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from manyōgana via cursive script. The upper part shows the character in the regular script form, the center character in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. Note also that the cursive script forms are not strictly confined to those in the illustration.\n\n When it was first developed, hiragana was not accepted by everyone. The educated or elites preferred to use only the kanji system. Historically, in Japan, the regular script (kaisho) form of the characters was used by men and called , \"men's writing\", while the cursive script (sōsho) form of the kanji was used by women. Hence hiragana first gained popularity among women, who were generally not allowed access to the same levels of education as men. And thus hiragana was first widely used among court women in the writing of personal communications and literature.  From this comes the alternative name of  \"women's writing\".  For example, The Tale of Genji and other early novels by female authors used hiragana extensively or exclusively.\n\nMale authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with katakana writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.\n\nOriginally, for all syllables there was more than one possible hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each syllable had only one hiragana. The deprecated hiragana are now known as .\n\nThe pangram poem Iroha-uta (\"ABC song/poem\"), which dates to the 10th century, uses every hiragana once (except n ん, which was just a variant of む before the Muromachi era).\n\nStroke order and direction \n\nThe following table shows the method for writing each hiragana character. It is arranged in the traditional way, beginning top right and reading columns down. The numbers and arrows indicate the stroke order and direction respectively. \n\nUnicode \n\nHiragana was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040–U+309F:\n\nThe Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and yōon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic ゐ wi and ゑ we and the rare ゔ vu; the archaic 𛀁 ye is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with dakuten and handakuten used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.\n\nCharacters U+3095 and U+3096 are small か (ka) and small け (ke), respectively.  U+309F is a ligature of より (yori) occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.\n\nHistoric and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were first added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0, with significantly more added in 2017 as part of Unicode 10.\n\nThe Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000–U+1B0FF, and is immediately followed by the Kana Extended-A block (U+1B100–U+1B12F). These blocks include mainly hentaigana (historic or variant hiragana):\n\nIn the following character sequences a kana from the /k/ row is modified by a handakuten combining mark to indicate that a syllable starts with an initial nasal, known as bidakuon. As of Unicode 10.0, these character combinations are explicitly called out as Named Sequences.",

The numbers and arrows indicate the stroke order and direction respectively. \n\nUnicode \n\nHiragana was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040–U+309F:\n\nThe Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and yōon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic ゐ wi and ゑ we and the rare ゔ vu; the archaic 𛀁 ye is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with dakuten and handakuten used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.\n\nCharacters U+3095 and U+3096 are small か (ka) and small け (ke), respectively.  U+309F is a ligature of より (yori) occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.\n\nHistoric and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were first added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0, with significantly more added in 2017 as part of Unicode 10.\n\nThe Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000–U+1B0FF, and is immediately followed by the Kana Extended-A block (U+1B100–U+1B12F). These blocks include mainly hentaigana (historic or variant hiragana):\n\nIn the following character sequences a kana from the /k/ row is modified by a handakuten combining mark to indicate that a syllable starts with an initial nasal, known as bidakuon. As of Unicode 10.0, these character combinations are explicitly called out as Named Sequences. Hiragana. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=13804."
