  "textBody" : "Honolulu (;Dictionary Reference) is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is an unincorporated part of and the county seat of the City and County of Honolulu on the island of O'ahu. The city is the main gateway to Hawai'i and a major portal into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.\n\nHonolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is the westernmost major U.S. city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as \"City of Honolulu\" (not to be confused with the \"City and County\") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the Honolulu census designated place (CDP) was 359,870 as of the 2017 population estimate. while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.\n\nHonolulu means \"sheltered harbor\" or \"calm port\". The old name is Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nu'uanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district. The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan near the city on December 7, 1941.\n\n, Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S. It is also the most populated Oceanian city outside Australasia and ranks second to Auckland as the most populous city in Polynesia.Long-Range Futures Research: An Application of Complexity Science, Robert Samet, 2009, 272\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century. However, after Kamehameha I conquered Oahu in the Battle of Nuuanu at Nuuanu Pali, he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawaii to Waikīkī in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now downtown Honolulu.  The capital was moved back to Kailua-Kona in 1812.\n\nIn 1794, Captain William Brown of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor. More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.\n\nIn 1845, Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu. He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital, erecting buildings such as St. Andrew's Cathedral, Iolani Palace, and Aliiōlani Hale. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.\n\nDespite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawaii's subsequent annexation by the United States in 1898, followed by a large fire in 1900, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nAn economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawaii. Modern air travel brings, , 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at Honolulu International Airport. Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawaii, with thousands of hotel rooms. The UK consulting firm Mercer, in a 2009 assessment \"conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments\", ranked Honolulu 29th worldwide in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public services including transportation.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Urban Honolulu Census-designated place (CDP) has a total area of .  of it (88.44%) is land, and  of it (11.56%) is water.\n\nHonolulu is the most remote major city in the world. The closest location on the mainland to Honolulu is the Point Arena Lighthouse in California, at 2045 nmi.Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 Software, Copyright 2006 by Microsoft Corp. et al. (Nautical vessels require some additional distance to circumnavigate Makapuʻu Point.) However, islands off the Mexican coast, and part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.\n\nNeighborhoods, boroughs, and districts\n\n* Downtown Honolulu is the financial, commercial, and governmental center of Hawaii. On the waterfront is Aloha Tower, which for many years was the tallest building in Hawai'i. Currently the tallest building is the 438 ft tall First Hawaiian Center, located on King and Bishop Streets.

Lower Kalihi, toward the ocean, is a light-industrial district.\n* Salt Lake and Aliamanu are (mostly) residential areas built in extinct tuff cones along the western end of the Honolulu District, not far from the Honolulu International Airport.\n* Moanalua is two neighborhoods and a valley at the western end of Honolulu, and home to Tripler Army Medical Center.\n\nClimate\n\nHonolulu experiences a tropical hot semi-arid climate (Köppen classification BSh), with a mostly dry summer season, due to a rain shadow effect.\nTemperatures vary little throughout the months, with average high temperatures of 80 – and average lows of 65 – throughout the year. Temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F on an average 38 days annually,This is comparable to Washington, D.C. despite being slightly warmer during the summer, see [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=hnl]. with lows in the upper 50s °F (14–15 °C) occurring once or twice a year. The highest recorded temperature was 95 °F during a heat wave in September 1998. The highest recorded temperature in the state was also recorded later that day in Ni'ihau. The lowest recorded temperature was 52 °F on February 16, 1902, and January 20, 1969. With high temperatures and humidity there is a vast tropical influence on the climate, although rainfall falls short of that classification.\n\nAnnual average rainfall is , which mainly occurs during the winter months of October through early April, with very little rainfall during the summer; similar to California's mediterranean climates. However, both seasons experience a similar number of rainy days. Light showers occur in summer while heavier rain falls during winter.

Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).\n\nThe City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing a 20 mi rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near Pearl Harbor and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating traffic congestion for West O'ahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.\n\nBicycle sharing\n\nSince June 28, 2017, PBSC operates [http://gobiki.org Biki] which is bicycle sharing program on O'ahu.

    "aggregatedText" : "Honolulu (;Dictionary Reference) is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is an unincorporated part of and the county seat of the City and County of Honolulu on the island of O'ahu. The city is the main gateway to Hawai'i and a major portal into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.\n\nHonolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is the westernmost major U.S. city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as \"City of Honolulu\" (not to be confused with the \"City and County\") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the Honolulu census designated place (CDP) was 359,870 as of the 2017 population estimate. while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.\n\nHonolulu means \"sheltered harbor\" or \"calm port\". The old name is Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nu'uanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district. The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan near the city on December 7, 1941.\n\n, Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S. It is also the most populated Oceanian city outside Australasia and ranks second to Auckland as the most populous city in Polynesia.Long-Range Futures Research: An Application of Complexity Science, Robert Samet, 2009, 272\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century. However, after Kamehameha I conquered Oahu in the Battle of Nuuanu at Nuuanu Pali, he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawaii to Waikīkī in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now downtown Honolulu.  The capital was moved back to Kailua-Kona in 1812.\n\nIn 1794, Captain William Brown of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor. More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.\n\nIn 1845, Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu. He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital, erecting buildings such as St. Andrew's Cathedral, Iolani Palace, and Aliiōlani Hale. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.\n\nDespite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawaii's subsequent annexation by the United States in 1898, followed by a large fire in 1900, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nAn economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawaii. Modern air travel brings, , 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at Honolulu International Airport. Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawaii, with thousands of hotel rooms. The UK consulting firm Mercer, in a 2009 assessment \"conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments\", ranked Honolulu 29th worldwide in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public services including transportation.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Urban Honolulu Census-designated place (CDP) has a total area of .  of it (88.44%) is land, and  of it (11.56%) is water.\n\nHonolulu is the most remote major city in the world. The closest location on the mainland to Honolulu is the Point Arena Lighthouse in California, at 2045 nmi.Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 Software, Copyright 2006 by Microsoft Corp. et al. (Nautical vessels require some additional distance to circumnavigate Makapuʻu Point.) However, islands off the Mexican coast, and part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.\n\nNeighborhoods, boroughs, and districts\n\n* Downtown Honolulu is the financial, commercial, and governmental center of Hawaii.

This complex of connecting ramps, some directly between H-1 and H-3, is in Halawa.\n\nOther major highways that link Honolulu CCD with other parts of the Island of Oahu are:\n* Pali Highway, State Rte. 61, crosses north over the Koolau range via the Pali Tunnels to connect to Kailua and Kaneohe on the windward side of the Island.\n* Likelike Highway, State Rte. 63, also crosses the Koolau to Kaneohe via the Wilson Tunnels.\n* Kalanianaole Highway, State Rte. 72, runs eastward from Waialae/Kahala to Hawaii Kai and around the east end of the island to Waimanalo Beach.\n* Kamehameha Highway, State Rts. 80, 83, 99 and 830, runs westward from near Hickam Air Force Base to Aiea and beyond, eventually running through the center of the island and ending in Kaneohe.\n\nLike most major American cities, the Honolulu metropolitan area experiences heavy traffic congestion during rush hours, especially to and from the western suburbs of Kapolei, 'Ewa Beach, Aiea, Pearl City, Waipahu, and Mililani.\n\nThere is a Hawai'i Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP).\n\nPublic transport\n\nHonolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation\n\nIn November 2010, voters approved a charter amendment to create a public transit authority to oversee the planning, construction, operation and future extensions to Honolulu's future rail system.  The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) currently includes a 10-member board of directors; three members appointed by the mayor, three members selected by the Honolulu City Council, and the city and state transportation directors. \nThe opening of the Honolulu Rail Transit is delayed until approximately 2018, as HART canceled the initial bids for the first nine stations and intends to rebid the work as three packages of three stations each, and allow more time for construction in the hope that increased competition on smaller contracts will drive down costs; initial bids ranged from $294.5 million to $320.8 million, far surpassing HART's budget of $184 million.honolulutransit.org [http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf Honolulu Transit E-Blast (PDF)]  August 18, 2014.\n\nBus\n\nEstablished by former Mayor Frank F. Fasi as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's TheBus system was honored in 1994–1995 and 2000–2001 by the American Public Transportation Association as \"America's Best Transit System\". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on O'ahu. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the non-profit corporation O'ahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services. Honolulu is ranked 4th for highest per-capita use of mass transit in the United States.[http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls National Transit Database] , Top Transit Cities (2006)\n\nRail\n\nCurrently, there is no urban rail transit system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company prior to World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).\n\nThe City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing a 20 mi rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near Pearl Harbor and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating traffic congestion for West O'ahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.\n\nBicycle sharing\n\nSince June 28, 2017, PBSC operates [http://gobiki.org Biki] which is bicycle sharing program on O'ahu. Most Biki stations are located between Chinatown/Downtown and Diamondhead, however, some Biki stations are in Kailua. The GoBiki.org website has a [https://gobiki.org/map-of-biki-stops/ Biki stations map].\n\nNotable people\n\nSister cities\n\nHonolulu currently has 29 sister cities:\n\nNational\n* San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1985\nInternational\n* Baguio, Philippines, 1995\n* Baku, Azerbaijan, 1998\n* Bombay (today: Mumbai), India, 1970\n* Bruyères, France, 1960\n* Candon, Philippines, 2015 \n* Caracas, Venezuela, 1990\n* Cebu City, Philippines, 1990\n* Chigasaki, Japan, 2014\n* Funchal, Portugal, 1979\n* Hainan, People's Republic of China, 1985\n* Hiroshima, Japan, 1959\n* Huế, Vietnam, 1995\n* Incheon, South Korea, 2003\n* Kaohsiung, Taiwan (Republic of China), 1962\n* Kyzyl, Russia\n*  Laoag, Philippines, 1969\n*  Majuro, Marshall Islands, 2009\n* Manila, Philippines, 1980\n* Mombasa, Kenya, 2000\n* Naha, Japan, 1960\n* Rabat, Morocco, 2007\n* Seoul, South Korea, 1973\n* Sintra, Portugal, 1998\n* Tokyo, Japan, 1960\n* Qinhuangdao, People's Republic of China, 2010\n* Uwajima, Japan, 2004\n* Vigan, Philippines, 2003\n* Zhongshan, People's Republic of China, 1997.
