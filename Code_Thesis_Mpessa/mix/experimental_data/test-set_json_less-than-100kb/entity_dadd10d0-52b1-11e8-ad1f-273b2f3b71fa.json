  "textBody" : "Cayuga Lake ( or)  is the longest of central New York's glacial Finger Lakes, and is the second largest in surface area (marginally smaller than Seneca Lake) and second largest in volume.  It is just under 40 mi long.  Its average width is 1.7 miles (2.7 km), and it is  at its widest point near Aurora.  It is approximately 435 ft at its deepest point.\n\nLocation\n\nThe city of Ithaca, site of Ithaca College and Cornell University, is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake.\n\nVillages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include Myers, King Ferry, Aurora, Levanna, Union Springs, and Cayuga.  Settlements along the west shore of the lake include Sheldrake, Poplar Beach, and Canoga.\n\nThe lake has one small island near Union Springs, Frontenac Island.  It is one of only two islands in the Finger Lakes, the other being Squaw Island in Canandaigua Lake.\n\nGeographical characteristics\n\nCayuga Lake is located at ;  above sea level. Its depth, steep east and west sides with shallow north and south ends is typical of the Finger Lakes, as they were carved by glaciers during the last ice age.\n\nThe water level is regulated by the Mud Lock at the north end of the lake. It is connected to Lake Ontario by the Erie Canal and Seneca Lake by the Seneca River. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.\n\nThe north end is dominated by shallow mudflats.  An important stopover for migratory birds, the mudflats and marsh are the location of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.\n\nHuman impact\n\nCayuga Lake is very popular among recreational boaters. The Allan H. Treman State Marine Park, a large state marina and boat launch, is located at the southern end of the lake in Ithaca.  There are two yacht clubs on the western shore: Ithaca Yacht Club a few miles north of Ithaca, and Red Jacket Yacht Club just south of Canoga. There are several other marinas and boat launches scattered along the lake shore.\n\nCayuga Lake is the source of drinking water for several communities, including Lansing near the southern end of the lake along the east side, which draws water through the Bolton Point Municipal Water system. There are also several lake source cooling systems that are in operation on the lake, whereby cooler water is pumped from the depths of the lake, warmed, and circulated in a closed system back to the surface. One of these systems, which is operated by Cornell University and began operation in 2000, was controversial during the planning and building states for potential negative environmental impact.  All the environmental impact reports and scientific studies have shown that the Cornell lake source cooling system has not yet had and will not likely have any measurably significant environmental impact. Furthermore, Cornell's system pumps significantly less warm water back into the lake than others further north which have been operating for decades, including the coal-fired power plant on the eastern shore.\n\nThe AES Cayuga electrical generating station operates in the Town of Lansing, on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. This coal-fired plant uses Cayuga Lake as a cooling source.  In the late 1960s, citizens successfully opposed the construction of an 830-MW nuclear power plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpbtrue&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0\nEJ107899&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0no&accno\nEJ107899  \"The Role of Experts in a Nuclear Siting Controversy\"][https://books.google.com/books?idMD4cPQAmF7oC&pg\nPA263&lpgPA263&dq\nCayuga+Lake+nuclear+power&sourceweb&ots\nf9NO88vkjr&sigDsaBb6otYOvd6rj5zl2N6ZEVhXg&hl\nen&saX&oi\nbook_result&resnum3&ct\nresult#PPA262,M1 Chain Reaction] pp. 262-264.Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

Serling and his family had a summer home at Cayuga Lake.http://www.rodserling.com/FAQ.htm\n\nFishing\n\nThe fish population is managed and substantial sport fishing is practiced, with anglers targeting smelt, lake trout and smallmouth bass. Fish species present in the lake include lake trout, landlocked salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, smelt, alewife, atlantic salmon, black crappie, bluegill, pickerel, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch. There are state owned hard surface ramps in Mudlock Canal Park, Long Point State Park, Cayuga Lake State Park, Dean's Cove State Marine Park, Taughannock Falls State Park, and Allen H.

According to Wells College records, this most recently happened in 1979 and 2015.  However, other sources suggest that the only time the entire lake froze over solid end to end in the 20th century was in 1912.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70810F63C5813738DDDA00994DA405B828DF1D3 New York Times February 19, 1912 CORNELL SKATERS DROWN page 1]Anthony Ingraham, \"Does Cayuga Lake Freeze Over?\", February 13, 2013.\n\nCayuga Lake, like nearby Seneca Lake, is also the site of a phenomenon known as the Guns of the Seneca, mysterious cannon-like booms heard in the surrounding area.
