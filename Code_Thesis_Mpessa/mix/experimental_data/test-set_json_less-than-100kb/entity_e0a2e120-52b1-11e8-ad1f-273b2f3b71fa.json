  "textBody" : "Chinese classic texts or canonical texts () refers to the Chinese texts which originated before the imperial unification by the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, particularly the \"Four Books and Five Classics\" of the Neo-Confucian tradition, themselves a customary abridgment of the \"Thirteen Classics\". All of these pre-Qin texts were written in classical Chinese. All three canons are collectively known as the classics (t , s , jīng, lit. \"warp\").\n\nChinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in vernacular Chinese or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing, in 1912. These can include shi (, historical works), zi (, philosophical works belonging to schools of thought other than the Confucian but also including works on agriculture, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and ji (, literary works) as well as jing (Chinese medicine).\n\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those Confucian scholars who wished to take the imperial exams to become government officials. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the literati (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the Chinese characters  of the \"Three Character Classic\" and the \"Hundred Family Surnames\" and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.\n\nScholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the burning of the books during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.\n\nBefore 221 BC\n\nIt is often difficult or impossible to precisely date pre-Qin works beyond them being \"pre-Qin\", a period of 1000 years.

The Siku classifies all works into 4 top-level branches: the Confucian Classics and their secondary literature; history; philosophy; and poetry.
