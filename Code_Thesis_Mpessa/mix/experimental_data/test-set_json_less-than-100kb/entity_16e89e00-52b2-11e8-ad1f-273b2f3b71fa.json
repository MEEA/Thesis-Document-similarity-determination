  "textBody" : "This article is about the demographic features of the population of Iraq, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nThe population is estimated to be  as of , with most of the population being Arab (75-80%), followed by Kurds (15-20%) and others (5%). Iraqis are 0.6% - 3% Christian (down from 6% before 2003), 3% Yazidis, 2% Shabaks with numerous other faiths Shia Muslims make up 65% and form the majority and the rest belong to other religious minorities.\n\nBackground\n\nIraq is the region known outside the Islamic world as Mesopotamia. The population estimate in 1920 was 3 million. The ruins of Ur, Babylon and other ancient cities are situated in Iraq, as is the legendary location of the Garden of Eden. Almost 75% of Iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from Tikrit to the Persian Gulf. The Tigris and the Euphrates carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. The water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the 7th millennium BC.\n\nPopulation\n\n( estimate), up from 31,234,000 (April 2009 IMF estimate)\n\nVital statistics\n\nUN estimates[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]\n\nBirths and deaths http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm\n\nFertility ages average in 1997-2006http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Iraq_FinalReport_2006_eng.pdf\n\nStructure of the population  \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates) :\n\nEthnic and religious groups\n\nIraq's dominant ethnic group are the Iraqi or Mesopotamian Arabs, who account for more than three-quarters of the population. They are a fusion of old Mesopotamians and Arabs, with other populations, who now speak Mesopotamian Arabic.\n\nIraqi Arabs (including Palestinians, Marsh Arabs, Bedouins and other Arab subgroups): 75-80%, Kurds (including Feylis, Yazidis, Shabaks and Kaka'is): 15-20%, Turkmen: 2%, Assyrians: 2%, other: 1% (Armenians, Circassians, Persians, Mandaeans/Sabians, Bahá'ís and Afro-Iraqis and Doms).\n\nKurds have one of the highest birth rates of any group in Iraq and the middle east.On the Margins of Nations: Endangered Languages and Linguistic Rights. Foundation for Endangered Languages. Conference, Joan A. Argenter, R. McKenna Brown - 2004\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic and Kurdish are the two official languages of Iraq. Arabic is spoken or understood by arab population and some kurdish intellectuals, while Kurdish is spoken or understood by the Kurdish population in northern Iraq.\n\nKurdish, including several dialects, is the second largest language and has regional language status in Iraqi Kurdistan. Aramaic, in antiquity spoken throughout the whole country, is now only spoken by the Assyrian minority.\n\nAzerbaijani is spoken in pockets of northern Iraq and numerous languages of the Caucasus are also spoken by minorities, notably the Chechen community.\n\nReligions\n\n97% of Iraqis follow Islam: 65% Shia and 30% Sunni.  1% of these describe themselves as \"Just a Muslim\".http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/ According to the CIA Factbook, Shias make up 65% of population, while Sunnis 30%. Christianity accounts for 5%, and the rest practice Mandaeism, Yazidism and other religions.\n\nWhile there has been voluntary relocation of many Christian families to northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 estimate). The percentage of Christians has fallen from 6% in 1991 or 1.5 million to about one third of this, due to massive exodus - two-thirds of Assyrian Christians have fled to other countries in the Middle East, Europe, United States and Canada.\n\nNearly all Iraqi Kurds are Yazidi, Muslim or follow Zoroastrianism. A survey in Iraq concluded that \"68% of Kurds in Iraq identified themselves as Sunnis and only 28% identified as Shias\".http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/20/who-are-the-iraqi-kurds/ The religious differences between Sunni Arabs and Sunni Kurds are big. While 89 percent of Shia Arabs belief that visiting the shrines of saints is acceptable, 71 percent of Sunni Arabs did and 59 percent of Sunni Kurds support this practice.
