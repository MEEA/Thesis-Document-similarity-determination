The derivations in this section are along the lines of Boltzmann's 1877 derivation, starting with result known as Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (from statistical thermodynamics). Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics gives the average number of particles found in a given single-particle microstate, under certain assumptions:McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, \n\nwhere:\n* i and j are indices (or labels) of the single-particle micro states,\n* Ni is the average number of particles in the single-particle microstate i,\n* N is the total number of particles in the system,\n* Ei is the energy of microstate i,\n* T is the equilibrium temperature of the system,\n* k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe assumptions of this equation are that the particles do not interact, and that they are classical; this means that each particle's state can be considered independently from the other particles' states. Additionally, the particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium. The denominator in Equation () is simply a normalizing factor so that the Ni/N add up to 1 — in other words it is a kind of partition function (for the single-particle system, not the usual partition function of the entire system).\n\nBecause velocity and speed are related to energy, Equation () can be used to derive relationships between temperature and the speeds of gas particles. All that is needed is to discover the density of microstates in energy, which is determined by dividing up momentum space into equal sized regions.\n\nDistribution for the momentum vector\n\nThe potential energy is taken to be zero, so that all energy is in the form of kinetic energy.\nThe relationship between kinetic energy and momentum for massive non-relativistic particles is\n\nwhere p2 is the square of the momentum vector \np = [px, py, pz]. We may therefore rewrite Equation () as:\n\nwhere Z is the partition function, corresponding to the denominator in Equation (). Here m is the molecular mass of the gas, T is the thermodynamic temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant.  This distribution of Ni/N is proportional to the probability density function fp for finding a molecule with these values of momentum components, so:\n\nThe normalizing constant c, can be determined by recognizing that the probability of a molecule having some momentum must be 1.  Therefore the integral of equation () over all px, py, and pz must be 1.\n\nIt can be shown that:\n|}}\n\nSubstituting Equation () into Equation () gives:\n\nThe distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables p_x, p_y, and p_z, with variance mkT. Additionally, it can be seen that the magnitude of momentum will be distributed as a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with a=\\sqrt{mkT}.\nThe Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the momentum (or equally for the velocities) can be obtained more fundamentally using the H-theorem at equilibrium within the Kinetic theory of gases framework.\n\nDistribution for the energy\n\nThe energy distribution is found imposing\n\nwhere d^3 \\textbf p is the infinitesimal phase-space volume of momenta corresponding to the energy interval dE.\nMaking use of the spherical symmetry of the energy-momentum dispersion relation E=| \\textbf p|^2/2m,\nthis can be expressed in terms of dE as\n\nUsing then () in (), and expressing everything in terms of the energy E, we get\n\n  f_E(E) dE \\frac{1}{(2\\pi m k T)^{3/2}} e^{-E/kT} 4 \\pi m \\sqrt{2mE} dE \n 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{1}{kT} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E}{kT} \\right) dE\n\nand finally\n\n \\left( \\frac{1}{kT} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E}{kT} \\right)\n|cellpadding |border |border colour #50C878 |background colour \n #ECFCF4|ref=9}}\n\nSince the energy is proportional to the sum of the squares of the three normally distributed momentum components, this distribution is a gamma distribution; in particular, it is a chi-squared distribution with three degrees of freedom.\n\nBy the equipartition theorem, this energy is evenly distributed among all three degrees of freedom, so that the energy per degree of freedom is distributed as a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom:, [https://books.google.com/books?idQF6iMewh4KMC&pg\nPA434 Appendix N, page 434]\n\nf_\\epsilon(\\epsilon)\\,d\\epsilon= \\sqrt{\\frac{1 }{\\pi \\epsilon kT}}~\\exp\\left[\\frac{-\\epsilon}{kT}\\right]\\,d\\epsilon\n\nwhere \\epsilon is the energy per degree of freedom. At equilibrium, this distribution will hold true for any number of degrees of freedom. For example, if the particles are rigid mass dipoles of fixed dipole moment, they will have three translational degrees of freedom and two additional rotational degrees of freedom. The energy in each degree of freedom will be described according to the above chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the total energy will be distributed according to a chi-squared distribution with five degrees of freedom. This has implications in the theory of the specific heat of a gas.\n\nThe Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution can also be obtained by considering the gas to be a type of quantum gas for which the approximation ε >> k T may be made.\n\nDistribution for the velocity vector\n\nRecognizing that the velocity probability density fv is proportional to the momentum probability density function by\n\nf_\\mathbf{v} d^3v = f_\\mathbf{p} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dv}\\right)^3 d^3v\n\nand using p = mv we get\n\nwhich is the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution.

It can also be seen that the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity\n[vx, vy, vz] is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:\n\nf_v \\left(v_x, v_y, v_z\\right) = f_v (v_x)f_v (v_y)f_v (v_z)\n\nwhere the distribution for a single direction is\n\nf_v (v_i) =\n\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT}}\n\\exp \\left[\n\\frac{-mv_i^2}{2kT}\n\\right].\n\nEach component of the velocity vector has a normal distribution with mean \\mu_{v_x} \\mu_{v_y} \n \\mu_{v_z} 0 and standard deviation \\sigma_{v_x} \n \\sigma_{v_y} \\sigma_{v_z} \n \\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}}, so the vector has a 3-dimensional normal distribution, a particular kind of multivariate normal distribution, with mean  \\mu_{\\mathbf{v}} {\\mathbf{0}}  and standard deviation \\sigma_{\\mathbf{v}} \n \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}.\n\nThe Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the speed follows immediately from the distribution of the velocity vector, above.  Note that the speed is\n\nv = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}\n\nand the volume element in spherical coordinates\n\n dv_x\\, dv_y\\, dv_z = v^2 \\sin \\theta\\, dv\\, d\\theta\\, d\\phi \n\nwhere \\phi and \\theta are the \"course\" (azimuth of the velocity vector) and \"path angle\" (elevation angle of the velocity vector).  Integration of the normal probability density function of the velocity, above, over the course (from 0 to 2\\pi) and path angle (from 0 to \\pi), with substitution of the speed for the sum of the squares of the vector components, yields the speed distribution.",

The probability of finding a particle with velocity in the infinitesimal element [dvx, dvy, dvz] about velocity v = [vx, vy, vz] is\n\nf_\\mathbf{v} \\left(v_x, v_y, v_z\\right)\\, dv_x\\, dv_y\\, dv_z.\n\nLike the momentum, this distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables v_x, v_y, and v_z, but with variance \\frac{kT}{m}.  It can also be seen that the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity\n[vx, vy, vz] is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:\n\nf_v \\left(v_x, v_y, v_z\\right) = f_v (v_x)f_v (v_y)f_v (v_z)\n\nwhere the distribution for a single direction is\n\nf_v (v_i) =\n\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT}}\n\\exp \\left[\n\\frac{-mv_i^2}{2kT}\n\\right].\n\nEach component of the velocity vector has a normal distribution with mean \\mu_{v_x} \\mu_{v_y} \n \\mu_{v_z} 0 and standard deviation \\sigma_{v_x} \n \\sigma_{v_y} \\sigma_{v_z} \n \\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{m}}, so the vector has a 3-dimensional normal distribution, a particular kind of multivariate normal distribution, with mean  \\mu_{\\mathbf{v}} {\\mathbf{0}}  and standard deviation \\sigma_{\\mathbf{v}} \n \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}.\n\nThe Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the speed follows immediately from the distribution of the velocity vector, above.  Note that the speed is\n\nv = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}\n\nand the volume element in spherical coordinates\n\n dv_x\\, dv_y\\, dv_z = v^2 \\sin \\theta\\, dv\\, d\\theta\\, d\\phi \n\nwhere \\phi and \\theta are the \"course\" (azimuth of the velocity vector) and \"path angle\" (elevation angle of the velocity vector).  Integration of the normal probability density function of the velocity, above, over the course (from 0 to 2\\pi) and path angle (from 0 to \\pi), with substitution of the speed for the sum of the squares of the vector components, yields the speed distribution.
