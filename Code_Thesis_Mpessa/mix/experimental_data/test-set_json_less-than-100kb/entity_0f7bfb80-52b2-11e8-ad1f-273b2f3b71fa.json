  "textBody" : "Highlander is a film and television franchise that began with a 1986 fantasy movie starring Christopher Lambert, who played Connor MacLeod, the Highlander. Born in Glenfinnan, in the Scottish Highlands in the 16th century, MacLeod is one of a number of Immortals. There have been five Highlander movies, two television series, an animated series, an animated movie, an animated flash-movie series, ten original novels, nineteen comic book issues, and various licensed merchandise.\n\nFilms\n\nHighlander (1986)\n\nThe first of the series of films, Highlander, directed by Russell Mulcahy, was released on March 7, 1986, with the tagline \"There Can Be Only One.\" The film features a number of flashback scenes establishing Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod's early history, and builds up to his final destiny among the last of the mysterious Immortals. Through a mentor and fellow Immortal — Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez — he learns of the existence of other Immortals, who appear spontaneously throughout history. An Immortal can die only after being beheaded, and Immortals battle one another in ritual single combat to the death, until the \"Gathering,\" when the few remaining Immortals will fight until only one remains to take \"The Prize.\" The Gathering occurs in modern-day (1985) New York City, when the Highlander, who has fallen in love again despite trying to distance himself from humanity, defeats The Kurgan, whom he has encountered repeatedly over the previous centuries, and who had slain Ramírez and many others. The movie was titled Shadow Clan in the earliest drafts. Upon its release, the film was not a financial success and was panned by critics. However, it gained a strong cult following, was a hit internationally, and is regarded by many as the best movie in the series.\n\nThe original orchestral score was composed by Michael Kamen, but the soundtrack included several songs by Queen, like \"Princes of the Universe,\" which were also used in the Highlander television series title sequence.\n\nBox office-wise, in the United States, the movie only took in $2,453,021 in its opening weekend and ended up grossing $5,735,847. However, the movie had more success internationally, taking in $12,885,193.\n\nHighlander II: The Quickening (1991)\n\nHighlander II: The Quickening, also directed by Russell Mulcahy, was released on November 1, 1991. The film mainly takes place in 2024, with flashbacks to events in 1999, and also a very distant past on the planet Zeist. MacLeod designs an energy shield to protect the Earth after its ozone layer began to disintegrate, but the Shield's heavy red clouds and blocking of natural sunlight have plunged mankind into despair. The Shield has also fallen under the control of the Shield Corporation, which taxes heavily for its services in the pursuit of profit. Meanwhile, MacLeod has physically aged into a frail old man — his mortality part of winning the Prize – and expects that he will eventually die of natural causes. After he kills one of the Immortals from Zeist sent to kill him, he becomes young and Immortal again, much to his dismay. He then joins with Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen), who had led a group of terrorists who try to dismantle the Shield.\n\nThis film offers an alternative origin for the Immortals, who are depicted as aliens exiled to Earth from Zeist. In direct contradiction to the original film, Ramírez and MacLeod were friends before their exile from Zeist. In the original, they first met in Scotland in 1541, with no mention of Zeist. This film was made almost entirely in Argentina; after the country's economy crashed, the film's investors took direct control of the film, removing Mulcahy and his creative influence almost entirely from the film. When it was released in 1991, it was panned by critics worldwide, and is now considered to be one of the worst movies ever made.Hicks, Chris. [http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/1,1257,792,00.html \"Highlander II: The Quickening.\"] Deseret News.\n\nRussell Mulcahy was disappointed with the movie as originally released, and later made his own \"Renegade Version\" director's cut with a proper sequencing of various scenes, and the filmmakers' explanation for why the movie turned out as it originally did. One of Mulcahy's most dynamic alterations was the relabeling of the Zeist footage as a flashback to an ancient, technologically advanced civilization on Earth, much more in line with the later continuity of the first film and the later TV series.Highlander II: To Be or Not to Be a Sequel? 1997.

Lions Gate Entertainment.\n\nHighlander III: The Sorcerer (1994)\n\nHighlander III: The Sorcerer (alternatively titled Highlander: The Final Dimension) was first released on November 25, 1994. \nMacLeod battles a warrior who missed the original Gathering, because he was buried deep in a Japanese cave that is holy ground, isolating him from the supposedly final contest of the first film. Kane (played by Mario Van Peebles) is a master of the \"power of illusion,\" which allows him to create false imagery to deceive his enemies. Connor, who has lived with his adopted son John for years with the belief that he is the final Immortal, must return to New York and finish the job he started back in 1985. Along the way, he finds a new love, Dr. Alex Johnson (Deborah Unger). The movie was a box office bomb. Critics and fans claim that it was little more than a carbon copy of the first film.\n\nHighlander: Endgame (2000)\n\nHighlander: Endgame, first released on September 1, 2000, was an attempt to merge characters from both the original film and from the Highlander TV series. The story follows Duncan MacLeod as he confronts Jacob Kell, an evil Immortal who has assembled a group of fellow warriors, as well as an impressive body-count. Kell, who holds a centuries-old grudge against the elder Connor MacLeod, has slain Connor's dearest loved ones, and he does not follow the traditions of single combat. Connor has spent a decade trying to escape the Game in a hidden Watcher fortress known as the Sanctuary, but he and Duncan are forced to confront this new threat that neither one of them alone can succeed against. As the two MacLeods will not break the single-combat tradition, Connor convinces Duncan to decapitate him, thus gaining the power that he needs to defeat Kell.\n\nCritical reaction to Highlander: Endgame was negative. It holds a 12% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews,[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highlander_endgame/ Rotten Tomatoes entry on Highlander: Endgame], retrieved January 15, 2010. higher than Highlander II and Highlander III, both of which hold ratings of 5% or lower,[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highlander_2_the_quickening/ Rotten Tomatoes entry on Highlander 2], retrieved January 15, 2010.[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highlander_3_the_final_dimension/ Rotten Tomatoes entry on Highlander 3], retrieved January 15, 2010. and a score of 21 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 reviews.[http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/highlanderendgame?q=Highlander:%20Endgame Metacritic entry on Highlander: Endgame], retrieved January 15, 2010.\n\nThe film was also a box office bomb, managing to garner only $15m of its $25m budget.

This prompted the producers to release the director's cut version of the film, whose reception was far better than the theatrical in that new and edited footage was added, along with better special effects and audio tracks.\n\nHighlander: The Search for Vengeance (2007)\n\nHighlander: The Search for Vengeance was an anime tie-in to the Highlander franchise. Released on June 5, 2007, the film featured a new MacLeod character, Colin, who became immortal after his death in Roman Britain, and follows his quest for revenge through the centuries against Marcus, an immortal Roman general, who repeatedly tries to conquer the world in order to instill a supposedly utopian society. Directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the film was written by David Abramowitz, who also wrote for Highlander: The Series, Highlander: The Raven and the Sci-Fi Channel film Highlander: The Source.\n\nHighlander: The Source (2007)\n\nHighlander: The Source is the fifth and final installment of the Highlander film series, which premiered on the Sci Fi Channel on September 15, 2007.
