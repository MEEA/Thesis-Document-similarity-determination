  "textBody" : "The joule; (symbol: J), is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).[https://web.archive.org/web/20060413141420/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/joule American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], Online Edition (2009). Houghton Mifflin Co., hosted by [https://web.archive.org/web/20010502171832/http://education.yahoo.com/ Yahoo! Education].The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1985). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., p. 691.McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Physics, Fifth Edition (1997). McGraw-Hill, Inc., p. 224. \n\nIn terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units:\n\\text{J} \\frac{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2}{\\text{s}^2} \n \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}  \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}^3 \n \\text{W} \\cdot \\text{s} = \\text{C} \\cdot \\text{V},\n\nwhere kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt.\n\nOne joule can also be defined as:\n* The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one \"coulomb-volt\" (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.\n* The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one \"watt-second\" (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.\n\nUsage\n\nConfusion with newton metre\n\nIn mechanics, the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of torque (about some angle):\n\nA result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre, which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the Joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name Joule, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts. The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.\n\nThe distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar – the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector – the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation\nE= \\tau \\theta\\ ,\nwhere E is energy, τ is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and θ is the angle swept (in radians). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.\n\nPractical examples \n\nOne joule in everyday life represents approximately:\n* The energy required to lift a medium-size tomato (100 g) 1 m vertically from the surface of the Earth.\n* The energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground.\n* The energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m⋅s−2 through a distance of 1 m.\n* The heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 °C.\n* The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17 ms).This is called the basal metabolic rate. It corresponds to about 1200 kcal per day. The kilocalorie (symbol kcal) is also known as the dietary calorie. \"At rest\" means awake but inactive.\n* The kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly ().\n* The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at 6 m/s.\n* The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1 kg moving at √2 ≈ 1.4 m/s.\n* The amount of electricity required to light a 1 W LED for 1 s.\n\nSince the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW⋅h (kilowatt-hour), a kW⋅h is thus 1000 W × 3600 s = 3.6 MJ (megajoules).\n\nMultiples \n\nFor additional examples, see: Orders of magnitude (energy)\n\nZeptojoule\n\nThe zeptojoule (zJ) is equal to one sextillionth (10−21) of one joule. 160 zeptojoules is about one electronvolt.\n\nPicojoule\n\nThe Picojoule (pJ) is equal to one trillionth (10−12) of one joule.\n\nNanojoule\n\nThe nanojoule (nJ) is equal to one billionth (10−9) of one joule. 160 nanojoules is about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito.\n\nMicrojoule\n\nThe microjoule (μJ) is equal to one millionth (10−6) of one joule.
