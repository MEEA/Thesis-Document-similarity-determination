  "textBody" : "Bombay Sapphire is a brand of gin that was first launched in 1987 by IDV. In 1997 Diageo sold the brand to Bacardi.http://www.grovesandwhitnall.co.uk/gj-distillers-warrington/ Its name originates from gin's popularity in India during the British Raj and the sapphire in question is the Star of Bombay on display at the Smithsonian Institution.[http://www.bacardilimited.com/our-brands/bombay-sapphire-gin Bombay Sapphire] Bombay Sapphire is marketed in a flat-sided, sapphire-coloured bottle that bears a picture of Queen Victoria on the label.\n\nThe flavouring of the drink comes from a recipe of ten ingredients: almond, lemon peel, liquorice, juniper berries, orris root, angelica, coriander, cassia, cubeb, and grains of paradise. Alcohol bought in from another supplier is evaporated three times using a carterhead still, and the alcohol vapours are passed through a mesh/basket containing the ten botanicals, in order to gain flavour and aroma. This is felt to give the gin a lighter, more floral taste compared to those gins that are created using a copper pot still. Water from Lake Vyrnwy is added to bring the strength of Bombay Sapphire down to 40.0% (UK, Canada, Australia). The blue colour comes from the bottle, not the gin.\n\nProduction\n\n2011, plans were announced to move the manufacturing process to a new facility at Laverstoke Mill in Whitchurch, Hampshire, including the restoration of the former Portal's paper mill at the proposed site, and the construction of a visitor centre. \n\nPlanning permission was granted in February 2012, and the centre opened to the public in the autumn of  2014.[http://www.gintime.com/news/a-first-glimpse-of-the-bombay-sapphire-distillery/ A first glimpse of the Bombay Sapphire distillery] Gintime 19 September 2014, The visitor centre included a new construction by Thomas Heatherwick of two glasshouses for plants used as botanicals in the production of Bombay Sapphire gin.\n\nProduction and bottling of the drink is contracted out by Bacardi to G&J Greenall.\n\nVarieties\n\nBacardi also markets Bombay Original London Dry Gin (or Bombay Original Dry). Eight botanical ingredients are used in the production of the Original Dry Gin variety as opposed to the ten in Bombay Sapphire.

This variety has another two botanicals, lemongrass and black peppercorns, in addition to the original ten. It is bottled at 42% and was designed to counteract the sweetness of American tonic water.\n\nA Special edition of Bombay Gin called Star of Bombay was produced in 2015 for the UK Market. It is bottled at 47.5% and is distilled from grain.\n\nDesign connection\n\nThe brand started a series of design collaborations. Their first step into the design world was a series of advertisements featuring work from currently popular designers. Their works, varying from martini glasses to tiles and cloth patterns, are labelled as “Inspired by Bombay Sapphire”. The campaign featured designers such as Marcel Wanders, Yves Behar, Karim Rashid, Ulla Darni, and Dror Benshetrit and performance artist Jurgen Hahn.\n\nFrom the success of this campaign, the company began a series of events and sponsored locations. The best known is the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition, held each year, where design students from all over the world can participate by designing their own “inspired” martini cocktail glass. The finalists (one from each participating country) are then invited to the yearly Salone del Mobile, an international design fair in Milano, where the winner is chosen.\n\nBombay Sapphire also endorses glass artists and designers with the Bombay Sapphire Prize, which is awarded every year to an outstanding design which features glass. Bombay Sapphire also showcases the designers' work in the Bombay Sapphire endorsed blue room, which is a design exhibition touring the world each year.\n\nFrom 2008 the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition final will be held at 100% Design in London, UK and the Bombay Sapphire Prize will take place in Milan at the Salone Del Mobile.\n\nEvaluation\n\nBombay Sapphire has been reviewed by several outside spirit ratings organizations to mixed success.
