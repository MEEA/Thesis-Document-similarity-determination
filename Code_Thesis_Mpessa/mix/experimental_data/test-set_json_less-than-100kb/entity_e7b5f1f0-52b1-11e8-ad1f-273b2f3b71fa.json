  "textBody" : "The decibel (symbol: dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of one value of a physical property to another, and may be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1 dB or -1 dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1 volt, then the suffix is \"V\" (i.e., \"20 dBV\"), and if the reference value is one milliwatt, then the suffix is \"m\" (i.e., \"20 dBm\"). However, sound pressure level is referenced to the \"threshold of hearing\" (generally given as 20 micropascals at 1 kHz), and the suffix is \"SPL\" (i.e., \"60 dB SPL\").\"[http://www.aes.org/par/d/#dB_SPL 0 dB-SPL],\" [http://www.aes.org/par/ Pro Audio Reference: Concepts, terminology, standards, etc.].

Retrieved 2017-09-23.\n\nThere are two different scales used when expressing a ratio in decibels depending on the nature of the quantities: field, power, and root-power. When expressing power quantities, the number of decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities.IEEE Standard 100 Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, New York, 2000; ; page 288 That is, a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level. When expressing field quantities, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The decibel scales differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in decibels.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. One decibel is one tenth (deci-) of one bel, named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most prominently in acoustics, electronics, and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the International System of Quantities, the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type level or level difference, which are defined as the logarithm of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally Miles of Standard Cable (MSC). 1 MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1 mile (approximately 1.6 km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000 radians per second (795.8 Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 ohms per loop mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054 microfarad per mile\" (approximately 19 gauge).\n\nIn 1924, Bell Telephone Laboratories received favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony in Europe and replaced the MSC with the Transmission Unit (TU). 1 TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power level.\nThe definition was conveniently chosen such that 1 TU approximated 1 MSC; specifically, 1 MSC was 1.056 TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU into the decibel, being one tenth of a newly defined unit for the base-10 logarithm of the power ratio. It was named the bel, in honor of the telecommunications pioneer Alexander Graham Bell.\nThe bel is seldom used, as the decibel was the proposed working unit., Robert J. Chapuis, Amos E. Joel, 2003\n\nThe naming and early definition of the decibel is described in the NBS Standard's Yearbook of 1931:\n\nIn April 2003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the International System of Units (SI), but decided against the proposal.[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CC/CCU/CCU16.pdf Consultative Committee for Units, Meeting minutes], Section 3  However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Organization for Standardization  (ISO).[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 \"Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units\"], IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0, International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.  The IEC permits the use of the decibel with field quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as NIST, which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios.  The term field quantity is deprecated by ISO 80000-1, which favors root-power.  In spite of their widespread use, suffixes (such as in dBA or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\nDefinition\n\nISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in ISO 80000-8. The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.\n\nThe ISO Standard 80000-3:2006 defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: . The bel (B) is  ln(10) nepers: . The neper is the change in the level of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of e, that is , thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, .  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of √10:1.\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10 (1.12202).\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with SI unit prefixes other than deci; it is preferred, for example, to use hundredths of a decibel rather than millibels.  Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written '0.05 dB', and not '5 mB'.Fedor Mitschke, Fiber Optics: Physics and Technology, Springer, 2010 .\n\nThe method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a power quantity or a field quantity; see Field, power, and root-power quantities for details.\n\nPower quantities\n\nWhen referring to measurements of power quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of P (measured power) to P0 (reference power) is represented by LP, that ratio expressed in decibels, which is calculated using the formula:\n\nL_P \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} \n 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power levels is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  P and P0 must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If  in the above equation, then LP = 0. If P is greater than P0 then LP is positive; if P is less than P0 then LP is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for P in terms of P0 and LP:\n\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\mathrm{dB}} P_0.\n\nField quantities and root-power quantities\n\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of F (measured field) and F0 (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and it is desirable for the two decibel formulations to give the same result in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n\nL_F \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} \n 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\mathrm{dB}} F_0.\n\nSimilarly, in electrical circuits, dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of voltage or current when the impedance is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation:\n\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V}{V_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n\nwhere V is the voltage being measured, V0 is a specified reference voltage, and GdB is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term root-power quantity is introduced by ISO Standard 80000-1:2009 as a substitute of field quantity.  The term field quantity is deprecated by that standard.\n\nConversions\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\nExamples\n\nAll of these examples yield dimensionless answers in dB because they are relative ratios expressed in decibels. The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a  reference point.\n* Calculating the ratio of  (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to  in decibels yields:\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{1000~\\mathrm{W}}{1~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) \n 30.\n\n* The ratio of  to  in decibels is\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{31.62~\\mathrm{V}}{1~\\mathrm{V}}\\right) \n 30.\n\n, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that GdB has the same value, 30, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\n* The ratio of  (one milliwatt) to  in decibels is obtained with the formula\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{0.001~\\mathrm{W}}{10~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) \n -40.\n\n* The power ratio corresponding to a  change in level is given by\n:\nG 10^\\frac{3}{10} \\times 1 \n 1.99526... \\approx 2.\n\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of . A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or  is approximately a change of 3 dB. More precisely, the change is ±3.0103 dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3 dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of .  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6 dB\" rather than ±6.0206 dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional significant figures.  3.00 dB is a power ratio of 10, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly .  Similarly, an increase of 6.00 dB is the power ratio is , about 0.5% different from 4.\n\nProperties\n\nThe decibel has the following properties:\n* The logarithmic scale nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a similar manner to scientific notation. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See Bode plot and semi-log plot.  For example, 120 dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n* Level values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(A × B × C) = log(A) + log(B) + log(C). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1 dB is approximately 26% power gain, 3 dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10 dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10 dB, 8 dB, and 7 dB respectively, for a total gain of 25 dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1 dB, this is:\n*:: 25 dB = 10 dB + 10 dB + 3 dB + 1 dB + 1 dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1 W x 10 x 10 x 2 x 1.26 x 1.26  ≈ 317.5 W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1 W x 10 = 316.2 W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\nSupporting arguments\n\nAccording to Mitschke, \"The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\"\n\nThe human perception of the intensity of sound and light approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship (Weber–Fechner law), making the dB scale a useful measure.\n\nCriticism\n\nVarious published articles have criticized the unit decibel as having shortcomings that hinder its understanding and use:C. W. Horton,\n[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6438830 \"The bewildering decibel\"] Elec. Eng., 73, 550-555 (1954)\n\nC. S. Clay (1999), Underwater sound transmission and SI units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3047\nR. Hickling (1999), Noise Control and SI Units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3048 According to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of slide rules than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.\n\nRepresenting the equivalent of zero watts is not possible, causing problems in conversions. Hickling concludes \"Decibels are a useless affectation, which is impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline\".\n\nA common source of confusion in using the decibel occurs when deciding about the use of 10 × log or 20 × log.  In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10 × log should be used, as deci means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current × current × resistance,  × velocity × velocity × mass.  Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as voltage, current, or pressure), then 10 × log is the correct expression for the square, or 20 × log for the field variable itself.\n\nQuantities in decibels are not necessarily additive,Nicholas P. Cheremisinoff (1996) Noise Control in Industry: A Practical Guide, Elsevier, 203 pp, p. [ 7]Andrew Clennel Palmer (2008), Dimensional Analysis and Intelligent Experimentation, World Scientific, 154 pp, p.13  thus being \"of unacceptable form for use in dimensional analysis\".J. C. Gibbings, Dimensional Analysis, [ p.37], Springer, 2011 .\n\nFor the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:R. J. Peters, Acoustics and Noise Control, Routledge, November 12, 2013, 400 pages, p.13 \"if two machines each individually produce a [sound pressure] level of, say, 90 dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93 dB, but certainly not to 180 dB!\"  \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87 dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83 dBA. ... the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83 dBA background noise from the combined level of 87 dBA; i.e., 84.8 dBA.\" \"in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. (...) Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of ... 70 dB and 90 dB: logarithmic average 87 dB; arithmetic average \n 80 dB.\"\n\nUses\n\nAcoustics\n\nThe decibel is commonly used in acoustics as a unit of sound pressure level. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure. Sound pressure is a field quantity, therefore the field version of the unit definition is used:\n\nL_p = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n\nwhere prms is the root mean square of the measured sound pressure in pascals and pref is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals in air and 1 micropascal in water.ISO 1683:2015\n\nThe human ear has a large dynamic range in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (1012). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 1012 is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120 dB re 20 μPa.\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4 kHz, are factored more heavily into some measurements using frequency weighting. (See also Stevens' power law.)\n\nElectronics\n\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (gains), in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a link budget.\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a suffix to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"dBm\".  Zero dBm is the level corresponding to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259 mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the dBu.  This is relative to the root mean square voltage which delivers 1 mW (0 dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or  ≈ 0.775 VRMS.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are identical.\n\nOptics\n\nIn an optical link, if a known amount of optical power, in dBm (referenced to 1 mW), is launched into a fiber, and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the blocking unit used to measure optical density is equivalent to −1 B.\n\nVideo and digital imaging\n\nIn connection with video and digital image sensors, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light levels, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented optical power is directly proportional to the voltage or level, not to its square, as in a CCD imager where response voltage is linear in intensity.\n\nThus, a camera signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range of 40 dB represents a power ratio of 100:1 between signal power and noise power, not 10,000:1.\n\nSometimes the 20 log ratio definition is applied to electron counts or photon counts directly, which are proportional to intensity without the need to consider whether the voltage response is linear.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics,  including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the stop, to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\nSuffixes and reference values\n\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard SI prefixes.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside SI units, the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, \"Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel\", Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition, NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF] The proper way, according to the IEC 60027-3, is either as Lx (re xref) or as Lx/xref, where x is the quantity symbol and xref is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., LE (re  1 μV/m) = LE/(1 μV/m) for the electric field strength E relative to 1 μV/m reference value.\n\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"λ\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses, dB(sm).\n\nVoltage\n\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n;dBV: dB(VRMS) – voltage relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.\n\n;dBu or dBv: RMS voltage relative to  Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.[http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB? Why not just use regular voltage and power measurements?] – rec.audio.pro Audio Professional FAQ  The \"v\" comes from \"volt\", while \"u\" comes from the volume unit used in the VU meter. dBu can be used as a measure of voltage, regardless of impedance, but is derived from a 600 Ω load dissipating 0 dBm (1 mW). The reference voltage comes from the computation  In professional audio, equipment may be calibrated to indicate a \"0\" on the VU meters some finite time after a signal has been applied at an amplitude of . Consumer equipment typically uses a  lower \"nominal\" signal level of . Therefore, many devices offer dual voltage operation (with different gain or \"trim\" settings) for interoperability reasons.  A switch or adjustment that covers at least the range between  and  is common in professional equipment.\n\n;dBmV: dB(mVRMS) – voltage relative to 1 millivolt across 75 Ω. Widely used in cable television networks, where the nominal strength of a single TV signal at the receiver terminals is about 0 dBmV. Cable TV uses 75 Ω coaxial cable, so 0 dBmV corresponds to −78.75 dBW (−48.75 dBm) or approx. 13 nW.\n\n;dBμV or dBuV: dB(μVRMS) – voltage relative to 1 microvolt.  Widely used in television and aerial amplifier specifications. 60 dBμV = 0 dBmV.\n\nAcoustics\n\nProbably the most common usage of \"decibels\" in reference to sound level is dB SPL, sound pressure level referenced to the nominal threshold of human hearing:  The measures of pressure (a field quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dB SIL and dB SWL) use the factor of 10.\n;dB SPL: dB SPL (sound pressure level) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 micropascals (μPa) = 2×10−5 Pa, approximately the quietest sound a human can hear.  For sound in water and other liquids, a reference pressure of 1 μPa is used.Morfey, C. L. (2001). Dictionary of Acoustics. Academic Press, San Diego. An RMS sound pressure of one pascal corresponds to a level of 94 dB SPL.\n;dB SIL: dB sound intensity level – relative to 10−12 W/m2, which is roughly the threshold of human hearing in air.\n;dB SWL: dB sound power level – relative to 10−12 W.\n;dBA, dBB, and dBC: These symbols are often used to denote the use of different weighting filters, used to approximate the human ear's response to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dBA or dB(A). According to ANSI standards,ANSI, [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/002/ansi.s1.4.1983.pdf S1.4-19823 Specification for Sound Level Meters], 2.3 Sound Level, p. 2-3. the preferred usage is to write LA = x dB.  Nevertheless, the units dBA and dB(A) are still commonly used as a shorthand for A-weighted measurements. Compare dBc, used in telecommunications.\n;dB HL: dB hearing level is used in audiograms as a measure of hearing loss. The reference level varies with frequency according to a minimum audibility curve as defined in ANSI and other standards, such that the resulting audiogram shows deviation from what is regarded as 'normal' hearing.\n;dB Q: sometimes used to denote weighted noise level, commonly using the ITU-R 468 noise weighting\n;dBpp: relative to the peak to peak sound pressure.Zimmer, Walter MX, Mark P.

In audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to a 600 ohm impedance, which corresponds to a voltage level of 0.775 volts or 775 millivolts.\n;dBFS: dB(full scale) – the amplitude of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale sinusoid or alternatively a full-scale square wave. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave will appear 3 dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0 dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = −3 dBFS(fullscale square wave).\n;dBVU: dB volume unitTharr, D.

    "aggregatedText" : "The decibel (symbol: dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of one value of a physical property to another, and may be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1 dB or -1 dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1 volt, then the suffix is \"V\" (i.e., \"20 dBV\"), and if the reference value is one milliwatt, then the suffix is \"m\" (i.e., \"20 dBm\"). However, sound pressure level is referenced to the \"threshold of hearing\" (generally given as 20 micropascals at 1 kHz), and the suffix is \"SPL\" (i.e., \"60 dB SPL\").\"[http://www.aes.org/par/d/#dB_SPL 0 dB-SPL],\" [http://www.aes.org/par/ Pro Audio Reference: Concepts, terminology, standards, etc.]. [http://www.aes.org/ Audio Engineering Society]. Retrieved 2017-09-23.\n\nThere are two different scales used when expressing a ratio in decibels depending on the nature of the quantities: field, power, and root-power. When expressing power quantities, the number of decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities.IEEE Standard 100 Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, New York, 2000; ; page 288 That is, a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level. When expressing field quantities, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The decibel scales differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in decibels.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. One decibel is one tenth (deci-) of one bel, named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most prominently in acoustics, electronics, and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the International System of Quantities, the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type level or level difference, which are defined as the logarithm of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally Miles of Standard Cable (MSC). 1 MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1 mile (approximately 1.6 km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000 radians per second (795.8 Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 ohms per loop mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054 microfarad per mile\" (approximately 19 gauge).\n\nIn 1924, Bell Telephone Laboratories received favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony in Europe and replaced the MSC with the Transmission Unit (TU). 1 TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power level.\nThe definition was conveniently chosen such that 1 TU approximated 1 MSC; specifically, 1 MSC was 1.056 TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU into the decibel, being one tenth of a newly defined unit for the base-10 logarithm of the power ratio. It was named the bel, in honor of the telecommunications pioneer Alexander Graham Bell.\nThe bel is seldom used, as the decibel was the proposed working unit., Robert J. Chapuis, Amos E. Joel, 2003\n\nThe naming and early definition of the decibel is described in the NBS Standard's Yearbook of 1931:\n\nIn April 2003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the International System of Units (SI), but decided against the proposal.[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CC/CCU/CCU16.pdf Consultative Committee for Units, Meeting minutes], Section 3  However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Organization for Standardization  (ISO).[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 \"Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units\"], IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0, International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.  The IEC permits the use of the decibel with field quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as NIST, which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios.  The term field quantity is deprecated by ISO 80000-1, which favors root-power.  In spite of their widespread use, suffixes (such as in dBA or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\nDefinition\n\nISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in ISO 80000-8. The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.\n\nThe ISO Standard 80000-3:2006 defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: . The bel (B) is  ln(10) nepers: . The neper is the change in the level of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of e, that is , thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, .  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of √10:1.\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10 (1.12202).\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with SI unit prefixes other than deci; it is preferred, for example, to use hundredths of a decibel rather than millibels.  Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written '0.05 dB', and not '5 mB'.Fedor Mitschke, Fiber Optics: Physics and Technology, Springer, 2010 .\n\nThe method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a power quantity or a field quantity; see Field, power, and root-power quantities for details.\n\nPower quantities\n\nWhen referring to measurements of power quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of P (measured power) to P0 (reference power) is represented by LP, that ratio expressed in decibels, which is calculated using the formula:\n\nL_P \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} \n 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power levels is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  P and P0 must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If  in the above equation, then LP = 0. If P is greater than P0 then LP is positive; if P is less than P0 then LP is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for P in terms of P0 and LP:\n\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\mathrm{dB}} P_0.\n\nField quantities and root-power quantities\n\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of F (measured field) and F0 (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and it is desirable for the two decibel formulations to give the same result in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n\nL_F \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} \n 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\mathrm{dB}} F_0.\n\nSimilarly, in electrical circuits, dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of voltage or current when the impedance is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation:\n\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V}{V_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n\nwhere V is the voltage being measured, V0 is a specified reference voltage, and GdB is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term root-power quantity is introduced by ISO Standard 80000-1:2009 as a substitute of field quantity.  The term field quantity is deprecated by that standard.\n\nConversions\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\nExamples\n\nAll of these examples yield dimensionless answers in dB because they are relative ratios expressed in decibels. The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a  reference point.\n* Calculating the ratio of  (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to  in decibels yields:\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{1000~\\mathrm{W}}{1~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) \n 30.\n\n* The ratio of  to  in decibels is\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{31.62~\\mathrm{V}}{1~\\mathrm{V}}\\right) \n 30.\n\n, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that GdB has the same value, 30, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\n* The ratio of  (one milliwatt) to  in decibels is obtained with the formula\n:\nG_\\mathrm{dB} 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{0.001~\\mathrm{W}}{10~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) \n -40.\n\n* The power ratio corresponding to a  change in level is given by\n:\nG 10^\\frac{3}{10} \\times 1 \n 1.99526... \\approx 2.\n\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of . A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or  is approximately a change of 3 dB. More precisely, the change is ±3.0103 dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3 dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of .  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6 dB\" rather than ±6.0206 dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional significant figures.  3.00 dB is a power ratio of 10, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly .  Similarly, an increase of 6.00 dB is the power ratio is , about 0.5% different from 4.\n\nProperties\n\nThe decibel has the following properties:\n* The logarithmic scale nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a similar manner to scientific notation. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See Bode plot and semi-log plot.  For example, 120 dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n* Level values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(A × B × C) = log(A) + log(B) + log(C). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1 dB is approximately 26% power gain, 3 dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10 dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10 dB, 8 dB, and 7 dB respectively, for a total gain of 25 dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1 dB, this is:\n*:: 25 dB = 10 dB + 10 dB + 3 dB + 1 dB + 1 dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1 W x 10 x 10 x 2 x 1.26 x 1.26  ≈ 317.5 W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1 W x 10 = 316.2 W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\nSupporting arguments\n\nAccording to Mitschke, \"The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\"\n\nThe human perception of the intensity of sound and light approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship (Weber–Fechner law), making the dB scale a useful measure.\n\nCriticism\n\nVarious published articles have criticized the unit decibel as having shortcomings that hinder its understanding and use:C. W. Horton,\n[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6438830 \"The bewildering decibel\"] Elec. Eng., 73, 550-555 (1954)\n\nC. S. Clay (1999), Underwater sound transmission and SI units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3047\nR. Hickling (1999), Noise Control and SI Units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3048 According to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of slide rules than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.\n\nRepresenting the equivalent of zero watts is not possible, causing problems in conversions. Hickling concludes \"Decibels are a useless affectation, which is impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline\".\n\nA common source of confusion in using the decibel occurs when deciding about the use of 10 × log or 20 × log.  In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10 × log should be used, as deci means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current × current × resistance,  × velocity × velocity × mass.  Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as voltage, current, or pressure), then 10 × log is the correct expression for the square, or 20 × log for the field variable itself.\n\nQuantities in decibels are not necessarily additive,Nicholas P. Cheremisinoff (1996) Noise Control in Industry: A Practical Guide, Elsevier, 203 pp, p. [ 7]Andrew Clennel Palmer (2008), Dimensional Analysis and Intelligent Experimentation, World Scientific, 154 pp, p.13  thus being \"of unacceptable form for use in dimensional analysis\".J. C. Gibbings, Dimensional Analysis, [ p.37], Springer, 2011 .\n\nFor the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:R. J. Peters, Acoustics and Noise Control, Routledge, November 12, 2013, 400 pages, p.13 \"if two machines each individually produce a [sound pressure] level of, say, 90 dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93 dB, but certainly not to 180 dB!\"  \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87 dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83 dBA. ... the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83 dBA background noise from the combined level of 87 dBA; i.e., 84.8 dBA.\" \"in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated.

Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of ... 70 dB and 90 dB: logarithmic average 87 dB; arithmetic average \n 80 dB.\"\n\nUses\n\nAcoustics\n\nThe decibel is commonly used in acoustics as a unit of sound pressure level. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure. Sound pressure is a field quantity, therefore the field version of the unit definition is used:\n\nL_p = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n\nwhere prms is the root mean square of the measured sound pressure in pascals and pref is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals in air and 1 micropascal in water.ISO 1683:2015\n\nThe human ear has a large dynamic range in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (1012). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 1012 is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120 dB re 20 μPa.\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4 kHz, are factored more heavily into some measurements using frequency weighting. (See also Stevens' power law.)\n\nElectronics\n\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (gains), in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a link budget.\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a suffix to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"dBm\".  Zero dBm is the level corresponding to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259 mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the dBu.  This is relative to the root mean square voltage which delivers 1 mW (0 dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or  ≈ 0.775 VRMS.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are identical.\n\nOptics\n\nIn an optical link, if a known amount of optical power, in dBm (referenced to 1 mW), is launched into a fiber, and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the blocking unit used to measure optical density is equivalent to −1 B.\n\nVideo and digital imaging\n\nIn connection with video and digital image sensors, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light levels, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented optical power is directly proportional to the voltage or level, not to its square, as in a CCD imager where response voltage is linear in intensity.\n\nThus, a camera signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range of 40 dB represents a power ratio of 100:1 between signal power and noise power, not 10,000:1.\n\nSometimes the 20 log ratio definition is applied to electron counts or photon counts directly, which are proportional to intensity without the need to consider whether the voltage response is linear.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics,  including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the stop, to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\nSuffixes and reference values\n\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard SI prefixes.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside SI units, the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, \"Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel\", Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition, NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF] The proper way, according to the IEC 60027-3, is either as Lx (re xref) or as Lx/xref, where x is the quantity symbol and xref is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., LE (re  1 μV/m) = LE/(1 μV/m) for the electric field strength E relative to 1 μV/m reference value.\n\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"λ\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses, dB(sm).\n\nVoltage\n\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n;dBV: dB(VRMS) – voltage relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.\n\n;dBu or dBv: RMS voltage relative to  Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.[http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB? Why not just use regular voltage and power measurements?] – rec.audio.pro Audio Professional FAQ  The \"v\" comes from \"volt\", while \"u\" comes from the volume unit used in the VU meter. dBu can be used as a measure of voltage, regardless of impedance, but is derived from a 600 Ω load dissipating 0 dBm (1 mW). The reference voltage comes from the computation  In professional audio, equipment may be calibrated to indicate a \"0\" on the VU meters some finite time after a signal has been applied at an amplitude of . Consumer equipment typically uses a  lower \"nominal\" signal level of . Therefore, many devices offer dual voltage operation (with different gain or \"trim\" settings) for interoperability reasons.  A switch or adjustment that covers at least the range between  and  is common in professional equipment.\n\n;dBmV: dB(mVRMS) – voltage relative to 1 millivolt across 75 Ω. Widely used in cable television networks, where the nominal strength of a single TV signal at the receiver terminals is about 0 dBmV. Cable TV uses 75 Ω coaxial cable, so 0 dBmV corresponds to −78.75 dBW (−48.75 dBm) or approx. 13 nW.\n\n;dBμV or dBuV: dB(μVRMS) – voltage relative to 1 microvolt.  Widely used in television and aerial amplifier specifications. 60 dBμV = 0 dBmV.\n\nAcoustics\n\nProbably the most common usage of \"decibels\" in reference to sound level is dB SPL, sound pressure level referenced to the nominal threshold of human hearing:  The measures of pressure (a field quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dB SIL and dB SWL) use the factor of 10.\n;dB SPL: dB SPL (sound pressure level) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 micropascals (μPa) = 2×10−5 Pa, approximately the quietest sound a human can hear.  For sound in water and other liquids, a reference pressure of 1 μPa is used.Morfey, C. L. (2001). Dictionary of Acoustics. Academic Press, San Diego. An RMS sound pressure of one pascal corresponds to a level of 94 dB SPL.\n;dB SIL: dB sound intensity level – relative to 10−12 W/m2, which is roughly the threshold of human hearing in air.\n;dB SWL: dB sound power level – relative to 10−12 W.\n;dBA, dBB, and dBC: These symbols are often used to denote the use of different weighting filters, used to approximate the human ear's response to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dBA or dB(A). According to ANSI standards,ANSI, [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/002/ansi.s1.4.1983.pdf S1.4-19823 Specification for Sound Level Meters], 2.3 Sound Level, p. 2-3. the preferred usage is to write LA = x dB.  Nevertheless, the units dBA and dB(A) are still commonly used as a shorthand for A-weighted measurements. Compare dBc, used in telecommunications.\n;dB HL: dB hearing level is used in audiograms as a measure of hearing loss. The reference level varies with frequency according to a minimum audibility curve as defined in ANSI and other standards, such that the resulting audiogram shows deviation from what is regarded as 'normal' hearing.\n;dB Q: sometimes used to denote weighted noise level, commonly using the ITU-R 468 noise weighting\n;dBpp: relative to the peak to peak sound pressure.Zimmer, Walter MX, Mark P.

In audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to a 600 ohm impedance, which corresponds to a voltage level of 0.775 volts or 775 millivolts.\n;dBFS: dB(full scale) – the amplitude of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale sinusoid or alternatively a full-scale square wave. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave will appear 3 dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0 dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = −3 dBFS(fullscale square wave).\n;dBVU: dB volume unitTharr, D.

Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, 13(10), 691-697.\n;dBTP: dB(true peak) - peak amplitude of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs.ITU-R BS.1770 In digital systems, 0 dBTP would equal the highest level (number) the processor is capable of representing.  Measured values are always negative or zero, since they are less than or equal to full-scale.\n;dBm0: Power in dBm measured at a zero transmission level point.\n\nRadar\n\n;dBZ: dB(Z) – decibel relative to Z = 1 mm6·m−3: energy of reflectivity (weather radar), related to the amount of transmitted power returned to the radar receiver. Values above 15–20 dBZ usually indicate falling precipitation.\n;dBsm: dB(m2) – decibel relative to one square meter: measure of the radar cross section (RCS) of a target. The power reflected by the target is proportional to its RCS. \"Stealth\" aircraft and insects have negative RCS measured in dBsm, large flat plates or non-stealthy aircraft have positive values.\n\nRadio power, energy, and field strength\n\n;dBc: relative to carrier—in telecommunications, this indicates the relative levels of noise or sideband power, compared with the carrier power.  Compare dBC, used in acoustics.\n;dBpp: relative to the maximum value of the peak power.\n;dBJ: energy relative to 1 joule. 1 joule 1 watt second \n 1 watt per hertz, so power spectral density can be expressed in dBJ.\n;dBm: dB(mW) – power relative to 1 milliwatt. In the radio field, dBm is usually referenced to a 50 ohm load, with the resultant voltage being 0.224 volts.\n;dBμV/m, dBuV/m, or dBμ: dB(μV/m) – electric field strength relative to 1 microvolt per meter. Often used to specify the signal strength from a television broadcast at a receiving site (the signal measured at the antenna output will be in dBμV).\n;dBf: dB(fW) – power relative to 1 femtowatt.\n;dBW: dB(W) – power relative to 1 watt.\n;dBk: dB(kW) – power relative to 1 kilowatt.\n;dBe: dB electrical.\n;dBo: dB optical. A change of 1 dBo in optical power can result in a change of up to 2 dBe in electrical signal power in system that is thermal noise limited.Chand, N., Magill, P. D., Swaminathan, S.

Rarely used, except in some marketing material. 0 dBq = −0.85 dBi\n;dBsm: dB(m2) – decibel relative to one square meter: measure of the antenna effective area.\n;dBm−1: dB(m−1) – decibel relative to reciprocal of meter: measure of the antenna factor.\n\nOther measurements\n\n;dB-Hz: dB(Hz) – bandwidth relative to one hertz. E.g., 20 dB-Hz corresponds to a bandwidth of 100 Hz. Commonly used in link budget calculations. Also used in carrier-to-noise-density ratio (not to be confused with carrier-to-noise ratio, in dB).\n;dBov or dBO: dB(overload) – the amplitude of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs.  Similar to dBFS, but also applicable to analog systems. According to ITU-T Rec.
