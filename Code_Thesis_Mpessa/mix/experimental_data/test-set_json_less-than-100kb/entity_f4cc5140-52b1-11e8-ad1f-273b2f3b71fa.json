Martial arts became something of a necessity and his father urged him to begin training. Boztepe recalled, \"Germany was not the healthiest place for a young Turk in those days of growing racism and neo-Nazi movements.\" He claimed to have been in over 300 street fights, many of them a result of this period, though he also claimed to have not started any of these fights.\n\nMartial arts career\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 14, Boztepe began studying martial arts, including judo, Shotokan karate, wrestling, Muay Thai, and traditional boxing.
