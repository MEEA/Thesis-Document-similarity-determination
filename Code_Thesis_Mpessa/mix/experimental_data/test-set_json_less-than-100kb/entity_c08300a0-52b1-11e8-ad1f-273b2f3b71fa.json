  "textBody" : "Amazonite (sometimes called \"Amazon stone\") is a green variety of microcline  feldspar.\n\nThe name is taken from  that of the Amazon River, from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green feldspar occurs in the Amazon area.\n\nAmazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of Miass in the Ilmensky Mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from Pike's Peak, Colorado, where it is found associated with smoky quartz, orthoclase, and albite in a coarse granite or pegmatite. Crystals of amazonite can also be found in Crystal Park, El Paso County, Colorado. Other locations in the United States which yield amazonite include the  Morefield Mine in Amelia, Virginia.[http://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DMR3/dmrpdfs/vamin/VAMIN_VOL38_NO02.pdf D.

Sweet, Mineral Collecting Sites in Virginia, Virginia Minerals, May 1992, V. 38, No. 2, pp. 10–11]  It is also found in pegmatite in Madagascar, Canada and in Brazil.\n\nBecause of its bright green color when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a cheap gemstone, although it is easily fractured, and loses its gloss due to its softness.\n\nFor many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar.\n\nGallery of Amazonite specimens\n\nFile:Microcline-Quartz-Albite-48224.jpg|Deep robins-egg blue color amazonite on smoky quartz\nFile:Amazonite, quartz 300-3-7927.JPG|Crystals of amazonite, from Pikes Peak, El Paso Co., Colorado, USA\nFile:Microcline-179612.jpg|Large Amazonite crystal from Konso special woreda, Ethiopia.
