  "textBody" : "Ad hominem (Latin for \"to the man\" or \"to the person\"), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.\n\nHowever, its original meaning was an argument \"calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason\".Fowler, H. W. (1926), A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (under Technical Terms)\n\nFallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a eugenic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.\n\nTypes \n\nTu quoque\n\nAd hominem tu quoque (literally: \"You also\") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a tu quoque response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is false because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a hypocrite, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.\n\nFor example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.\n\nCircumstantial\n\nCircumstantial ad hominem points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument false; this overlaps with the genetic fallacy (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).\n\nThe circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.\n\nExamples:\n\n# Mandy Rice-Davies's famous testimony during the Profumo Affair, \"He would [say that], wouldn't he?\", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a callgirl, would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair. \n#: However, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does not strengthen the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of argumentum ad hominem and appeal to emotions); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened. (For example, inferring guilt from a denialor, less starkly, excessive devaluation of a denialis a very common feature in conspiracy theories, witch-hunts, show trials, struggle sessions, and other coercive circumstances in which the person targeted is presumed guilty.)\n# Glassner suggests that Bennett is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions Bennett has taken on other issues. However wrong Bennett may have been on other issues, such as the funding of public television or illegitimacy, that does not mean that his criticisms of rap were mistaken.\n\nGuilt by association\n\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ad hominem fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C.\n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAn example of this fallacy could be \"My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?\"\n\nNon-fallacious reasoning \n\nWhen a statement is challenged by making an ad hominem attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was an argument or a statement of fact (testimony). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.\n\nCriticism as a fallacy \n\nDoug Walton,  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue, as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor has argued that ad hominem reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the apodictic reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.",
