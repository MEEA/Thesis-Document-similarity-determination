It has no etymological connection in French with Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle (attested as Egincourt 875), which is derived from another Germanic male name *Ingin-.Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, éditions Larousse 1968. p. 4.\nThe battle was named after a nearby castle  called Azincourt. The modern settlement has in turn been named after the battle in the 17th century.\n\nHistory\n\nAzincourt is famous as being near the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King Henry V of England defeated the forces led by Charles d'Albret on behalf of Charles VI of France, which has gone down in history as the Battle of Agincourt. According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle.The House of Commons: 1509 – 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T.

In 1513, Henry VIII crossed the English Channel, stopping by at Azincourt.\n\nThe battle, as was the tradition, was named after a nearby castle called Azincourt.
