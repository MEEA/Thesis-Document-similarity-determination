  "textBody" : "The Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, often referred to simply as Philippians, is the eleventh book in the New Testament. Paul and Timothy first visited Philippi in Greece during Paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD. Philippi was the location of the first Christian community established in Europe.\n\nBiblical scholars are in general agreement that the letter was indeed written by Paul of Tarsus. The estimated date of the letter is 62 AD, about 10 years after Paul's first visit to Philippi.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.\n\nHistorical background\n\nThe historical background of Philippians is traditionally gathered from two main primary New Testament sources: informative internal data from the letter itself, and related information garnered from the rest of the New Testament Canon, especially from the Acts of the Apostles and the other Pauline Epistles.Frederick F. Bruce, 1989, Philippians, NIBC, NT Series, edited by W. Ward Gasque (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson), 4. Other primary information is also derived from external historical sources related to the chronological connections between Paul's association with Philippi, its political and economical setting, and its social and religio-philosophical context.Wayne Jackson, 1987, The Book of Philippians: A Grammatical and Practical Study (Abilene, Tex.: Quality Publications), 13–17.\n\nAccording to the document itself, the Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their envoy (\"messenger [apostolon] and minister [leitourgon]\" Phil 2:25), with contributions as an expression of their \"partnership\" and \"concern\" to meet the needs of Paul (, , and ).\n\nDuring the execution of his responsibilities of travel to deliver their \"gift\" (), Epaphroditus contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness (esthenese, cf. ). At some point he recovers. It is at this time, whether premeditated or due to an extended stay with the apostle, various internal matters are revealed to Paul on the part of Epaphroditus (, , , , , and ).\n\nUpon Epaphroditus' return to health, Paul sends word to the Philippians through Epaphroditus of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in the face of death (1:18b–26), along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the Lord despite one's circumstances (2:14–18). Moreover, Paul sends counsel regarding spiritual adversaries among the Philippians (3:1–21), and conflicts within their fellowship (4:2–3). Lastly, he provides receipt of both Epaphroditus' heroism (2:25–30) and the arrival of \"the gift\" (4:10), along with his promise of a divine accounting (4:17–20).\n\nWithin the letter is also found an optimism where Paul's belief of his release is the basis upon which he promises to send Timothy to them for ministry (3:19–23), and an anticipation to also pay them a personal visit (2:24). With this communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey (2:28–29).\n\nThere has been ongoing debate regarding where Paul was when he wrote this letter (and therefore the date of the letter's composition). Internal evidence in the letter itself points clearly to it being composed while Paul was in custody (Philippians 1:7,13), but which period of imprisonment is highly debated . Some suggest the Roman imprisonment at the end of the Book of Acts (chapter 28:30,31). Others suggest the earlier Caesarean imprisonment (Acts 23–26). Still others suggest an earlier imprisonment again, and postulate an Ephesian imprisonment during Paul's lengthy stay in that city (Acts 19). Until recently no one seems to have advocated the second period of Roman imprisonment (after the end of the book of Acts, but attested to in the writings of early church fathers).Clement of Rome (late 1st century) makes a reference to the ministry of Paul after the end of Acts. Clement, To the Corinthians, 5. In J. B. Lightfoot (ed), The Apostolic Fathers (Michigan: Baker Book House, 1978) 15. The author of the Muratorian Canon (late 2nd century) says that Luke recorded mostly that which he himself witnessed and therefore that is why he did not include ‘the journey of Paul, when he went from the city – Rome – to Spain.’ The Muratoriun Canon. 2. The apocryphal Acts of Peter makes reference to the tradition that Paul reached Spain. Paul is described in prison in Rome, receiving a vision from God that he would go to Spain. Acts of Peter, Verscelli Acts 1 and 3. Eusebius (early 300’s) recorded that Paul did more ministry after his first jail time in Rome. Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, II, 22, 1–8, in Philip Schaff and Henry Wace (editors), A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church 2nd series. Vol.1. Eusebius: Church History, Life of Constantine the Great, and Oration in Praise of Constantine (Edinburgh: Eerdmans, 1997) 124–125. Jim Reiher considered and speculated on this theory in a 2012 article.Jim Reiher, “Could Philippians have been written from the Second Roman Imprisonment?” Evangelical Quarterly. Vol. LXXXIV. No. 3 July 2012. pp. 213–233. This article summarises the other theories, and offers examples of different scholars who adhere to different theories, but presents a different option for consideration The main reasons suggested for a later date, include:\n# The letter's highly developed Ecclesiology\n# An impending sense of death permeating the letter\n# The absence of any mention of Luke in a letter to Luke’s home church (when the narrative in Acts clearly suggests that Luke was with Paul in his first Roman imprisonment)\n# A harsher imprisonment than the open house arrest of his first Roman imprisonment\n# A similar unique expression that is shared only with 2 Timothy \n# A similar disappointment with co-workers shared only with 2 Timothy.\n\nThis second Roman imprisonment theory is still to be rigorously debated in the wider theological community.\n\nAuthorship \n\nThe letter begins in standard form for an ancient Hellenistic letter structure, with author – or senders – first, then recipients with a greeting (Phil. 1.1–2).Ronald Russell, 1982, \"Pauline Letter Structure in Philippians,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 25.3 (Sept.): 297–298.\n\nThe address and the greeting is clear:\n\"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.

They were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. Of all the churches, their contributions (which Paul gratefully acknowledges) are among the only ones he accepts.
