  "textBody" : "Fricatives are consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together. These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of; the back of the tongue against the soft palate, in the case of German (the final consonant of Bach); or the side of the tongue against the molars, in the case of Welsh (appearing twice in the name Llanelli). This turbulent airflow is called frication.  A particular subset of fricatives are the sibilants. When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition, the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth.  English,,, and are examples of sibilants.\n\nThe usage of two other terms is less standardized: \"Spirant\" can be a synonym of \"fricative\", or (as in e.g. Uralic linguistics) refer to non-sibilant fricatives only. \"Strident\" could mean just \"sibilant\", but some authors include also labiodental and uvular fricatives in the class.\n\nTypes\n\nSibilants\n\n* voiceless coronal sibilant, as in English sip\n* voiced coronal sibilant, as in English zip\n* voiceless dental sibilant\n* voiced dental sibilant\n* voiceless apical sibilant\n* voiced apical sibilant\n* voiceless postalveolar sibilant (laminal)\n* voiced postalveolar sibilant (laminal)\n* voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant (domed, partially palatalized), as in English ship\n* voiced palato-alveolar sibilant (domed, partially palatalized), as the s in English vision\n* voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant (laminal, palatalized)\n* voiced alveolo-palatal sibilant (laminal, palatalized)\n* voiceless retroflex sibilant (apical or subapical)\n* voiced retroflex sibilant (apical or subapical)\n\nAll sibilants are coronal, but may be dental, alveolar, postalveolar, or palatal (retroflex) within that range.

Prototypical retroflexes are subapical and palatal, but they are usually written with the same symbol as the apical postalveolars.

This is a typical feature of Australian Aboriginal languages, where the few fricatives that exist result from changes to plosives or approximants, but also occurs in some indigenous languages of New Guinea and South America that have especially small numbers of consonants.

Languages of South and East Asia, such as the Dravidian and Austronesian languages, typically do not have such voiced fricatives as and, which are familiar to many European speakers. These voiced fricatives are also relatively rare in indigenous languages of the Americas. Overall, voicing contrasts in fricatives are much rarer than in plosives, being found only in about a third of the world's languages as compared to 60 percent for plosive voicing contrasts.Maddieson, Ian. \"Voicing in Plosives and Fricatives\", in Martin Haspelmath et al.

Cambridge University Press, 1984. .\n\nThis phenomenon occurs because voiced fricatives have developed from lenition of plosives or fortition of approximants. This phenomenon of unpaired voiced fricatives is scattered throughout the world, but is confined to nonsibilant fricatives with the exception of a couple of languages that have but lack.
