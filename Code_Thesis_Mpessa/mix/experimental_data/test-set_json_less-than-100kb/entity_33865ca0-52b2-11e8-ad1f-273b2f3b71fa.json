  "textBody" : "Larousse Gastronomique is an encyclopedia of gastronomy. The majority of the book is about French cuisine, and contains recipes for French dishes and cooking techniques.

Gilbert was a collaborator in the creation of this book as well as Le Guide Culinaire with Escoffier, leading to some cross-over with the two books. It caused Escoffier to note when he was asked to write the preface that he could \"see with my own eyes,\" and \"Montagné cannot hide from me the fact that he has used Le Guide as a basis for his new book, and certainly used numerous recipes.\"James, 266–68\n\nThe third English edition (2001), which runs to approximately 1350 pages has been modernized and includes additional material on other cuisines.
