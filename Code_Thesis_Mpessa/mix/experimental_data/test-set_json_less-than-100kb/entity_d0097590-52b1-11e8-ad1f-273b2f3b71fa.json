  "textBody" : "Batman (often promoted as Batman: The Movie) is a 1966 American superhero film based on the Batman television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the DC Comics character Batman. Released by 20th Century Fox, the film starred Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The film hit theaters two months after the last episode of the first season of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of Lee Meriwether as the Catwoman, the character previously played by Julie Newmar in two episodes of the series' first season.\n\nPlot\n\nWhen Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the Batcopter. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellent, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City (The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler, and The Catwoman).\n\nThe United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. The Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist \"Miss Kitka\", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: The Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with heavy water, used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile.\n\nUltimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council. Giving chase in the batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually the Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.\n\nBatman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.\n\nWith the world watching, the Security Council is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this \"mixing of minds\" does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leave United World Headquarters by climbing out of the window and descending on their batropes.\n\nCast\n\n* Adam West as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Burt Ward as Dick Grayson / Robin\n* Lee Meriwether as The Catwoman ()\n* Cesar Romero as The Joker\n* Burgess Meredith as The Penguin\n* Frank Gorshin as The Riddler\n* Alan Napier as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Neil Hamilton as Commissioner James Gordon\n* Stafford Repp as Chief Miles O'Hara\n* Madge Blake as Aunt Harriet Cooper\n* Reginald Denny as Commodore Schmidlapp\n* Milton Frome as Vice Admiral Fangschleister\n* Gil Perkins as Bluebeard\n* Dick Crockett as Morgan\n* George Sawaya as Quetch\n* Van Williams (uncredited voice) as President Lyndon B.

Though Julie Newmar had at this point played Catwoman in two episodes of season one in the TV series, she had other commitments at that timeGarcia, Bob, \"Batman: Catwoman,\" Cinefantastique, Vol. 26, #6/Vol. 7, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 19 (interview with Julie Newmar). and was replaced by Lee Meriwether in the film. According to the Biography special Catwoman: Her Many Lives, aired on July 20, 2004, it was stated that Newmar was unable to reprise her role due to a reported back injury. Catwoman was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of season two of the series; Eartha Kitt would then play Catwoman in three episodes of season three.\n\nIn his autobiography, Adam West writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired. Batman was Denny's final film appearance. Jack LaLanne has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.\n\nProduction\n\nWilliam Dozier wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed Batman TV series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, 20th Century Fox, refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).Garcia, Bob, \"Batman: Making the Original Movie\", Cinefantastique, Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.\n\nThe film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer Lorenzo Semple, Jr. and directed by Leslie H. Martinson. Martinson had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: \"The Penguin Goes Straight\" and \"Not Yet, He Ain't\".\n\nTone\n\nEven though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. They felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader \"captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly\".[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)].

The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck. The penchant for giving devices a \"Bat-\" prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of Batman's campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.\n\nFurthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into Cold War issues paying heavy attention to Polaris Missiles, war surplus submarines and taking a poke at the Pentagon. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!, Chris Gould, 2011\n\nVehicles\n\nBesides the Batmobile, other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:\n* Batcycle with side car\n* Batboat, provided by Glastron\n* Batcopter\n\nOf the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the Batman film, only the Batcycle properly crossed over into the TV series as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the Batcopter and Batboat from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: \"Walk the Straight and Narrow\"), they primarily did so in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nNelson Riddle's original score to Batman the Movie was released in 2010 by La-La Land Records and Fox Music.
