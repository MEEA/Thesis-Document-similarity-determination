  "textBody" : "A chambered cairn is a burial monument, usually constructed during the Neolithic, consisting of a sizeable (usually stone) chamber around and over which a cairn of stones was constructed. Some chambered cairns are also passage-graves. They are found throughout Britain and Ireland, with the largest number in Scotland.\n\nTypically, the chamber is larger than a cist, and will contain a larger number of interments, which are either excarnated bones or inhumations (cremations). Most were situated near a settlement, and served as that community's \"graveyard\".\n\nScotland\n\nBackground\n\nDuring the early Neolithic (4000-3300 BC) architectural forms are highly regionalised with timber and earth monuments predominating in the east and stone-chambered cairns in the west. During the later Neolithic (3300-2500 BC) massive circular enclosures and the use of grooved ware and Unstan ware pottery emerge.Noble (2006) p. 15 Scotland has a particularly large number of chambered cairns; they are found in various different types described below. Along with the excavations of settlements such as Skara Brae, Links of Noltland, Barnhouse, Rinyo and Balfarg and the complex site at Ness of Brodgar these cairns provide important clues to the character of civilization in Scotland in the Neolithic.Barclay (2005) pp. 41, 46 However the increasing use of cropmarks to identify Neolithic sites in lowland areas has tended to diminish the relative prominence of these cairns.Barclay, Gordon \"The Neolithic\" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) p. 131\n\nIn the early phases bones of numerous bodies are often found together and it has been argued that this suggests that in death at least, the status of individuals was played down.Barclay (2005) p. 20 During the late Neolithic henge sites were constructedBarclay (2005) p. 29 and single burials began to become more commonplace;  by the Bronze Age it is possible that even where chambered cairns were still being built they had become the burial places of prominent individuals rather than of communities as a whole.Barclay (2005) pp. 52, 55Barclay, Gordon \"The Neolithic\" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) pp. 132-33\n\nClyde-Carlingford court cairns\n\nThe Clyde or Clyde-Carlingford type are principally found in northern and western Ireland and southwestern Scotland. They first were identified as a separate group in the Firth of Clyde region, hence the name. Over 100 have been identified in Scotland alone. Lacking a significant passage, they are a form of gallery grave. The burial chamber is normally located at one end of a rectangular or trapezoidal cairn, while a roofless, semi-circular forecourt at the entrance provided access from the outside (although the entrance itself was often blocked), and gives this type of chambered cairn its alternate name of court tomb or court cairn. These forecourts are typically fronted by large stones and it is thought the area in front of the cairn was used for public rituals of some kind. The chambers were created from large stones set on end, roofed with large flat stones and often sub-divided by slabs into small compartments. They are generally considered to be the earliest in Scotland.Noble (2006) pp. 104-05\n\nExamples include Cairn Holy I and Cairn Holy II near Newton Stewart,Noble (2006) pp. 111-12 a cairn at Port Charlotte, Islay, which dates to 3900-4000 BC,Noble (2006) p. 108[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/37313/details/islay+port+charlotte/ \"Islay, Port Charlotte\"].

Canmore. Retrieved 7 August 2012.\n\nOrkney-Cromarty\n\nThe Orkney-Cromarty group is by far the largest and most diverse. It has been subdivided into Yarrows, Camster and Cromarty subtypes but the differences are extremely subtle. The design is of dividing slabs at either side of a rectangular chamber, separating it into compartments or stalls.Ritchie, Graham \"The Early Peoples\" in Omand (2003) p. 29 The number of these compartments ranges from 4 in the earliest examples to over 24 in an extreme example on Orkney. The actual shape of the cairn varies from simple circular designs to elaborate 'forecourts' protruding from each end, creating what look like small amphitheatres. It is likely that these are the result of cultural influences from mainland Europe, as they are similar to designs found in France and Spain.\n\nExamples include Midhowe on Rousay and Unstan Chambered Cairn from the Orkney Mainland, both of which date from the mid 4th millennium BC and were probably in use over long periods of time. When the latter was excavated in 1884, grave goods were found that gave their name to Unstan ware pottery.[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/tombs/midhowe/index.html \"The Midhowe Stalled Cairn, Rousay\"].

They appear relatively late and only in Orkney and it is not clear why the use of cairns continued in the north when their construction had largely ceased elsewhere in Scotland. They consist of a central chamber from which lead small compartments, into which burials would be placed. The central chambers are tall and steep-sided and have corbelled roofing faced with high quality stone.Barclay (2005) pp. 40-41\n\nIn addition to Maeshowe itself, which was constructed c. 2700 BC, there are various other examples from the Orkney Mainland.

Excavations in 1861 indicated a rectangular central chamber surrounded by five smaller chambers. Because of the structure's unusual design, it was originally presumed to be an early form. However, later interpretations and further excavation work in 2002 suggested that they have more in common with the later Maeshowe type rather than the stalled Orkney-Cromarty cairns.[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/worldheritagesite/bookancairn.htm \"The Bookan Chambered Cairn, Sandwick\"].

The whole chamber is cross or trefoil-shaped and there are no smaller individual compartments. An example is to be found on the uninhabited island  of Vementry on the north side of the West Mainland, where it appears that the cairn may have originally been circular and its distinctive heel shape added as a secondary development, a process repeated elsewhere in Shetland.
