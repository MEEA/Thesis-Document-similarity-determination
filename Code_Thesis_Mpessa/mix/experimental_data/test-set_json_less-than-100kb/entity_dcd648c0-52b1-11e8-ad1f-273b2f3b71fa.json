  "textBody" : "The Colorado Rockies are an American professional baseball team based in Denver, Colorado. The Rockies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. The team's home venue is Coors Field, located in the Lower Downtown area of Denver. The Rockies won their only National League championship in 2007, after having won 14 of their final 15 games in order to secure a Wild Card position. In the World Series they were swept by the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox in four games.\n\nHistory\n\nDenver had long been a hotbed of Denver Bears/Zephyrs Minor League Baseball and many in the area desired a Major League team. Following the Pittsburgh drug trials, an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the Pittsburgh Pirates and relocate them. However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (along with the Florida (now Miami) Marlins), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and Michael I. Monus was granted a franchise; they took the name \"Rockies\" due to Denver's proximity to the Rocky Mountains, which is reflected in their logo. Monus and Antonucci were forced to drop out in 1992 after Monus' reputation was ruined by an accounting scandal. Trucking magnate Jerry McMorris stepped in at the 11th hour to save the franchise, allowing the team to begin play in 1993.  The Rockies shared Mile High Stadium (which had originally been built for the Bears) with the National Football League (NFL)'s Denver Broncos for their first two seasons while Coors Field was constructed. It was completed for the 1995 Major League Baseball season.\n\nIn 1993, they started play in the Western division of the National League. Since that date, the Rockies have reached the Major League Baseball postseason four times, each time as the National League wild card team. Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. In 2007, the Rockies advanced to the World Series, only to be swept by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe Rockies have played their home games at Coors Field since 1995. Their newest Spring training home, Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in March 2011 and is shared with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nSeason record\n\nUniform\n\nAt the start of the 2012 season, the Rockies introduced \"Purple Mondays\" in which the team wears its purple uniform every Monday game day.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famers\n\nNo inducted members of the Baseball Hall of Fame have played for or managed the Rockies.\n\nColorado Sports Hall of Fame\n\nIndividual awards\n\nNL MVP\n\n*1997 – Larry Walker\n\nNLCS MVP\n\n*2007 – Matt Holliday\n\nNL Rookie of the Year\n\n*2002 – Jason Jennings\n\nSilver Slugger Award\n\n*Dante Bichette (1995)\n*Vinny Castilla (1995, 1997–98)\n*Andrés Galarraga (1996)\n*Eric Young (1996)\n*Ellis Burks (1996)\n*Larry Walker (1997, 1999)\n*Mike Hampton (2001–02)\n*Todd Helton (2000–03)\n*Matt Holliday (2006–08)\n*Carlos González (2010, 2015)\n*Troy Tulowitzki (2010–11)\n*Michael Cuddyer (2013)\n*Nolan Arenado (2015–17)\n*Charlie Blackmon (2016–17)\n\nHank Aaron Award\n\n*2000 – Todd Helton\n\nGold Glove Award\n\n*Larry Walker (1997–99, 2001–02)\n*Neifi Pérez (2000)\n*Todd Helton (2001–02, 2004)\n*Carlos González (2010, 2012–13)\n*Troy Tulowitzki (2010–11)\n*Nolan Arenado (2013–17)\n*DJ LeMahieu (2014, 2017)\n\nManager of the Year Award\n\n*1995 – Don Baylor\n*2009 – Jim Tracy\n\nNL Batting Champion  \n\n* Andrés Galarraga (1993)\n* Larry Walker (1998, 1999, 2001)\n* Todd Helton (2000)\n* Matt Holliday (2007)\n* Carlos González (2010)\n* Michael Cuddyer (2013)\n* Justin Morneau (2014)\n* DJ LeMahieu (2016)\n* Charlie Blackmon (2017)\n\nDHL Hometown Heroes (2006)\n\n*Larry Walker – voted by MLB fans as the most outstanding player in the history of the franchise, based on on-field performance, leadership quality and character value\n\nTeam award\n\n* – Warren Giles Trophy (National League champion)\n*2007 – Baseball America Organization of the Year\n\nTeam records (single-game, single-season, career)\n\nChampionships\n\n| colspan\"3\" style\n\"text-align:center;\"| National League Champions\n|-\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Preceded by:St. Louis Cardinals\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:center;\"| 2007\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Succeeded by:Philadelphia Phillies\n|-\n| colspan\"3\" style\n\"text-align:center;\"| National League Wild Card Winners\n|-\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Preceded by:None (First)\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:center;\"| 1995\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Succeeded by:Los Angeles Dodgers\n|-\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Preceded by:Los Angeles Dodgers\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:center;\"| 2007\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Succeeded by:Milwaukee Brewers\n|-\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Preceded by:Milwaukee Brewers\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:center;\"| 2009\n| style=\"width:30%; text-align:center;\"| Succeeded by:Atlanta Braves\n|-\n\nRetired numbers\n\nTodd Helton is the sole Colorado player to have his number (17) retired, which was done on Sunday, August 17, 2014.\n\nJackie Robinson's number, 42, was retired throughout all of baseball in 1997.\n\nKeli McGregor had worked with the Rockies since their inception in 1993, rising from senior director of operations to team president in 2002, until his death on April 20, 2010.
