A private company Seedco has released 5 MSV cultivars.\n\nRefuges \n\nUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a refuge) to provide a location to harbor vulnerable pests. Typically, 20% of corn in a grower's fields must be refuge; refuge must be at least 0.5 miles from Bt corn for lepidopteran pests, and refuge for corn rootworm must at least be adjacent to a Bt field.\n\nThe theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA. A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.\n\nUnmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.\n\nSeed bags containing both Bt and refuge seed have been approved by the EPA in the United States. These seed mixtures were marketed as \"Refuge in a Bag\" (RIB) to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional work needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. The EPA approved a lower percentage of refuge seed in these seed mixtures ranging from 5 to 10%. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for corn rootworm, but may increase the risk of resistance for lepidopteran pests, such as European corn borer. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.\n\nResistance \n\nResistant strains of the European corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management.Staff, University of Minnesota Extension. [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/cropsystems/dc7055.html#ch11 Section: Can European corn borer develop resistance to Bt corn? in the Bt Corn & European Corn Borer]\n\nIn November 2009, Monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to first-generation Bt cotton in parts of Gujarat, India – that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Bollworm resistance to first generation Bt cotton has been identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States. In 2012, a Florida field trial demonstrated that army worms were resistant to pesticide-containing GM corn produced by Dupont-Dow; armyworm resistance was first discovered in Puerto Rico in 2006, prompting Dow and DuPont to voluntarily stop selling the product on the island.Jack Kaskey for Bloomberg News Nov 16, 2012 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-16/dupont-dow-corn-defeated-by-armyworms-in-florida-study.html DuPont-Dow Corn Defeated by Armyworms in Florida: Study]\n\nRegulation \n\nRegulation of GM crops varies between countries, with some of the most-marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses.Wesseler, J. and N. Kalaitzandonakes (2011): Present and Future EU GMO policy. In Arie Oskam, Gerrit Meesters and Huib Silvis (eds.), EU Policy for Agriculture, Food and Rural Areas. Second Edition, pp. 23-323 – 23-332. Wageningen: Wageningen Academic PublishersBeckmann, V., C. Soregaroli, J. Wesseler (2011): Coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-modified (non GM) crops: Are the two main property rights regimes equivalent with respect to the coexistence value? In \"Genetically modified food and global welfare\" edited by Colin Carter, GianCarlo Moschini and Ian Sheldon, pp 201-224. Volume 10 in Frontiers of Economics and Globalization Series. Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing\n\nControversy \n\nThere is a scientific consensusBut see also:And contrast:and that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.Some medical organizations, including the British Medical Association, advocate further caution based upon the precautionary principle: Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.\n\nThe scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies.\n\nGM crops provide a number of ecological benefits, but there are also concerns for their overuse, stalled research outside of the Bt seed industry, proper management and issues with Bt resistance arising from their misuse.Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. April 13, 2010 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/business/energy-environment/14crop.html?pagewantedall&_r\n0 Study Says Overuse Threatens Gains From Modified Crops]\n\nCritics have objected to GM crops on ecological, economic and health grounds. The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law, mostly patents. The first generation of GM crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015. Monsanto has claimed it will not pursue farmers who retain seeds of off-patent varieties. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, protests and to restrictive legislation in most countries.Wesseler, J. (ed.) (2005): Environmental Costs and Benefits of Transgenic Crops. Dordrecht, NL: Springer Press\n\nEffects on nontarget insects \n\nCritics claim that Bt proteins could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects as well as the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported. While cyt proteins are toxic towards the insect order Diptera (flies), certain cry proteins selectively target lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), while other cyt selectively target Coleoptera. As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the cry protein, and therefore Bt. Regulatory agencies assess the potential for the transgenic plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release.\n\nA 1999 study found that in a lab environment, pollen from Bt maize dusted onto milkweed could harm the monarch butterfly.Losey JE et al. (1999) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term10353241 Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae.] Nature 399: 214 Several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory, resulting in a risk assessment that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real-world conditions was negligible. A 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that \"the commercial large-scale cultivation of current Bt–maize hybrids did not pose a significant risk to the monarch population\". A 2007 review found that \"nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides. However, in comparison with insecticide-free control fields, certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in Bt fields.\"\n\nGene flow \n\nGene flow is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another. Concerns focus on the interaction between GM and other maize varieties in Mexico, and of gene flow into refuges.\n\nIn 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for genetically modified maize,GMO Compass. 5 June 2009 [http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/447.mexico_controlled_cultivation_genetically_modified_maize.html Mexico: controlled cultivation of genetically modified maize] but because Mexico is the center of diversity for maize, gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world's maize strains.Mike Shanahan for Science and Development Network, 10 November 2004.

The data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact. Nature later stated, \"the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper\". A 2005 large-scale study failed to find any evidence of contamination in Oaxaca. However, other authors also found evidence of cross-breeding between natural maize and transgenic maize.\n\nA 2004 study found Bt protein in kernels of refuge corn.\n\nIn 2017, a large-scale study found \"pervasive presence of transgenes and glyphosate in maize-derived food in Mexico\"https://www.uccs.mx/images/library/file/Agricultura_y_alimentacion/alisa/2017_gmo/Pervasive_presence_of_transgenes_in_maize_food_2017.pdf\n\nFood \n\nThe French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vendômois et al. study and concluded that it \"..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.\" However, the French government applies the precautionary principle with respect to GMOs.\n\nA review by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and others of the same study concluded that the results were due to chance alone.[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/gmo100127-m.pdf EFSA Minutes of the 55th Plenary Meeting of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Mofified Organisms Held on 27-28 January 2010 IN Parma, Italy, Annex 1, Vendemois et al. 2009] European Food Safety Authority report, Retrieved 27 July 2012\n\nA 2011 Canadian study looked at the presence of CryAb1 protein (BT toxin) in non-pregnant women, pregnant women and fetal blood.

A private company Seedco has released 5 MSV cultivars.\n\nRefuges \n\nUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a refuge) to provide a location to harbor vulnerable pests. Typically, 20% of corn in a grower's fields must be refuge; refuge must be at least 0.5 miles from Bt corn for lepidopteran pests, and refuge for corn rootworm must at least be adjacent to a Bt field.\n\nThe theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA. A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.\n\nUnmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.\n\nSeed bags containing both Bt and refuge seed have been approved by the EPA in the United States. These seed mixtures were marketed as \"Refuge in a Bag\" (RIB) to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional work needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. The EPA approved a lower percentage of refuge seed in these seed mixtures ranging from 5 to 10%. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for corn rootworm, but may increase the risk of resistance for lepidopteran pests, such as European corn borer. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.\n\nResistance \n\nResistant strains of the European corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management.Staff, University of Minnesota Extension. [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/cropsystems/dc7055.html#ch11 Section: Can European corn borer develop resistance to Bt corn? in the Bt Corn & European Corn Borer]\n\nIn November 2009, Monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to first-generation Bt cotton in parts of Gujarat, India – that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Bollworm resistance to first generation Bt cotton has been identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States. In 2012, a Florida field trial demonstrated that army worms were resistant to pesticide-containing GM corn produced by Dupont-Dow; armyworm resistance was first discovered in Puerto Rico in 2006, prompting Dow and DuPont to voluntarily stop selling the product on the island.Jack Kaskey for Bloomberg News Nov 16, 2012 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-16/dupont-dow-corn-defeated-by-armyworms-in-florida-study.html DuPont-Dow Corn Defeated by Armyworms in Florida: Study]\n\nRegulation \n\nRegulation of GM crops varies between countries, with some of the most-marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses.Wesseler, J. and N. Kalaitzandonakes (2011): Present and Future EU GMO policy. In Arie Oskam, Gerrit Meesters and Huib Silvis (eds.), EU Policy for Agriculture, Food and Rural Areas. Second Edition, pp. 23-323 – 23-332. Wageningen: Wageningen Academic PublishersBeckmann, V., C.

Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing\n\nControversy \n\nThere is a scientific consensusBut see also:And contrast:and that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.Some medical organizations, including the British Medical Association, advocate further caution based upon the precautionary principle: Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.\n\nThe scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies.\n\nGM crops provide a number of ecological benefits, but there are also concerns for their overuse, stalled research outside of the Bt seed industry, proper management and issues with Bt resistance arising from their misuse.Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. April 13, 2010 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/business/energy-environment/14crop.html?pagewantedall&_r\n0 Study Says Overuse Threatens Gains From Modified Crops]\n\nCritics have objected to GM crops on ecological, economic and health grounds. The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law, mostly patents. The first generation of GM crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015. Monsanto has claimed it will not pursue farmers who retain seeds of off-patent varieties. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, protests and to restrictive legislation in most countries.Wesseler, J. (ed.) (2005): Environmental Costs and Benefits of Transgenic Crops. Dordrecht, NL: Springer Press\n\nEffects on nontarget insects \n\nCritics claim that Bt proteins could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects as well as the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported. While cyt proteins are toxic towards the insect order Diptera (flies), certain cry proteins selectively target lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), while other cyt selectively target Coleoptera. As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the cry protein, and therefore Bt. Regulatory agencies assess the potential for the transgenic plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release.\n\nA 1999 study found that in a lab environment, pollen from Bt maize dusted onto milkweed could harm the monarch butterfly.Losey JE et al. (1999) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term10353241 Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae.] Nature 399: 214 Several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory, resulting in a risk assessment that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real-world conditions was negligible. A 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that \"the commercial large-scale cultivation of current Bt–maize hybrids did not pose a significant risk to the monarch population\". A 2007 review found that \"nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides. However, in comparison with insecticide-free control fields, certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in Bt fields.\"\n\nGene flow \n\nGene flow is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another. Concerns focus on the interaction between GM and other maize varieties in Mexico, and of gene flow into refuges.\n\nIn 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for genetically modified maize,GMO Compass. 5 June 2009 [http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/447.mexico_controlled_cultivation_genetically_modified_maize.html Mexico: controlled cultivation of genetically modified maize] but because Mexico is the center of diversity for maize, gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world's maize strains.Mike Shanahan for Science and Development Network, 10 November 2004.

The data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact. Nature later stated, \"the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper\". A 2005 large-scale study failed to find any evidence of contamination in Oaxaca. However, other authors also found evidence of cross-breeding between natural maize and transgenic maize.\n\nA 2004 study found Bt protein in kernels of refuge corn.\n\nIn 2017, a large-scale study found \"pervasive presence of transgenes and glyphosate in maize-derived food in Mexico\"https://www.uccs.mx/images/library/file/Agricultura_y_alimentacion/alisa/2017_gmo/Pervasive_presence_of_transgenes_in_maize_food_2017.pdf\n\nFood \n\nThe French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vendômois et al. study and concluded that it \"..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.\" However, the French government applies the precautionary principle with respect to GMOs.\n\nA review by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and others of the same study concluded that the results were due to chance alone.[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/gmo100127-m.pdf EFSA Minutes of the 55th Plenary Meeting of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Mofified Organisms Held on 27-28 January 2010 IN Parma, Italy, Annex 1, Vendemois et al. 2009] European Food Safety Authority report, Retrieved 27 July 2012\n\nA 2011 Canadian study looked at the presence of CryAb1 protein (BT toxin) in non-pregnant women, pregnant women and fetal blood. All groups had detectable levels of the protein, including 93% of pregnant women and 80% of fetuses at concentrations of 0.19 ± 0.30 and 0.04 ± 0.04 mean ± SD ng/ml, respectively. The paper did not discuss safety implications or find any health problems. The paper was found to be unconvincing by multiple authors and organizations.[http://ddata.over-blog.com/xxxyyy/1/39/38/37/commentaires-papier-Aris-Leblanc-par-AdeWeck.pdf Alain de Weck: Une protéine pesticide OGM (Cry1ab) dans le sang de femmes gravides et de leur fœtus? Un travail bâclé et un scénario catastrophe très probablement inexistant] In a swine model, Cry1Ab-specific antibodies were not detected in pregnant sows or their offspring and no negative effects from feeding Bt maize to pregnant sows were observed.\n\nIn January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority released all data submitted by Monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance.\n\nStarlink corn recalls \n\nStarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University, Page last updated March 11, 2004 [http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/transgeniccrops/hotstarlink.html StarLink Corn] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.Michael R.

This corn became the subject of the widely publicized Starlink corn recall, which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.King D, Gordon A. [http://www.foe.org/act/getacobellpr.html Contaminant found in Taco Bell taco shells. Food safety coalition demands recall] (press release), vol 2001. Washington, DC: Friends of the Earth, 2000. 3 November 2001. The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.

[http://www.usda.gov/documents/LLP%20Incidents%202.docx LLP Incidents] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.\n\nA subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while \"the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this.\"[http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/SAP/meetings/2001/july/julyfinal.pdf FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel Report No. 2001-09, July 2001]\n\nThe US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.\n\nIn 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.\n\nCorporate espionage \n\nOn December 19, 2013 six Chinese citizens were indicted in Iowa on charges of plotting to steal genetically modified seeds worth tens of millions of dollars from Monsanto and DuPont. Mo Hailong, director of international business at the Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co., part of the Beijing-based DBN Group, was accused of stealing trade secrets after he was found digging in an Iowa cornfield.
