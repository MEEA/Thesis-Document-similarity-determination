He sometimes goes into hospital or takes a break or has a change of scenery to recharge his batteries.\" In January 2010 Oddie spoke to the media, revealing that he had in fact had two separate stays in different hospitals, only being discharged \"in time for Christmas\". He said that he was dealing with depression and bipolar disorder, describing the period as \"probably the worst 12 months of my life\". Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.\n\nHis illness meant that Oddie did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 series of Springwatch, although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter. He subsequently claimed he was dismissed from Springwatch and that this had caused the depressive illness.\n\nOddie presented the BBC Radio 4 Appeal programme on 10 August 2014 on behalf of the charity Bipolar UK.

On 11 March 2009 it was reported that he had been admitted to Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone, to deal with his depression. His then agent David Foster said: \"Bill gets these bouts every two or three years where he gets down for about two weeks and recovers. He sometimes goes into hospital or takes a break or has a change of scenery to recharge his batteries.\" In January 2010 Oddie spoke to the media, revealing that he had in fact had two separate stays in different hospitals, only being discharged \"in time for Christmas\". He said that he was dealing with depression and bipolar disorder, describing the period as \"probably the worst 12 months of my life\". Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.\n\nHis illness meant that Oddie did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 series of Springwatch, although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter. He subsequently claimed he was dismissed from Springwatch and that this had caused the depressive illness.\n\nOddie presented the BBC Radio 4 Appeal programme on 10 August 2014 on behalf of the charity Bipolar UK.
