  "textBody" : "Lois McMaster Bujold ( ; born November 2, 1949) is an American speculative fiction writer. She is one of the most acclaimed writers in her field, having won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, matching Robert A. Heinlein's record, not counting his Retro Hugo. Her novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" won both the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. In the fantasy genre, The Curse of Chalion won the Mythopoeic Award for Adult Literature and was nominated for the 2002 World Fantasy Award for best novel, and both her fourth Hugo Award and second Nebula Award were for Paladin of Souls. In 2011 she was awarded the Skylark Award. In 2013 she was awarded the Forry Award. In 2017 she won a Hugo Award for Best Series, for the Vorkosigan Saga.\n\nThe bulk of Bujold's works comprises three separate book series: the Vorkosigan Saga, the Chalion Series, and the Sharing Knife series.\n\nBiography\n\nBujold is the daughter of Robert Charles McMastercf. a [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id1384&page\n266 Memorial Tribute] in his honor and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the Vorkosigan Saga, to his influence. He was editor of the monumental Nondestructive Testing Handbook generally referred to as McMaster on Materials.\n\nBujold writes that her experience growing up with a world-famous father is reflected in the same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up in the shadow of a \"Great Man\".  Having observed this tendency in both genders, she wonders why it is always called \"great man's son syndrome\", and never \"great man's daughter's syndrome.\" Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of Falling Free.Bujold, Lois McMaster.  Forward to Miles, Mutants, Microbes Omnibus edition, paragraphs 11 & 13\n\nShe became a member of science fiction fandom, joined the Central Ohio Science Fiction Society, and co-published StarDate, a science fiction fanzine in which a story of hers appeared under the byline Lois McMaster.\n\nBujold currently lives in Medicine Lake, Minnesota. She is divorced and has two children; her daughter Anne Bujold is a Portland, Oregon metal artist, welder, and vice president of the Northwest Blacksmith Association.\n\nScience fiction\n\nLois Bujold wrote three books (Shards of Honor, The Warrior's Apprentice and Ethan of Athos) before The Warrior's Apprentice was accepted after four rejections. The Warrior's Apprentice was the first book purchased, though not the first Vorkosigan book written, nor would it be the first one to be published.  On the strength of The Warrior's Apprentice, Baen Books agreed to a three-book deal to include the two bracketing novels. Thus began her career in writing in science fiction. By 2010, Baen Books claimed to have sold 2 million copies of Bujold's books.\n\nBujold is best known for her Vorkosigan saga, a series of novels featuring Miles Vorkosigan, a physically impaired interstellar spy and mercenary admiral from the planet Barrayar, set approximately 1000 years in the future. The series also includes prequels starring Miles' parents, along with companion novels centered on secondary characters. Earlier titles are generally firmly in the space opera tradition with no shortage of battles, conspiracies, and wild twists, while in more recent volumes, Miles becomes more of a detective. In A Civil Campaign, Bujold explores yet another genre: a high-society romance with a plot that pays tribute to Regency romance novelist Georgette Heyer (as acknowledged in the dedication). It centers on a catastrophic dinner party, with misunderstandings and dialogue justifying the subtitle \"A Comedy of Biology and Manners\".\n\nThe author has stated that the series structure is modeled after the Horatio Hornblower books, documenting the life of a single person. In themes and echoes, they also reflect Dorothy L. Sayers' mystery character Lord Peter Wimsey.  Bujold has also said that part of the challenge of writing a series is that many readers will encounter the stories in \"utterly random order\", so she must provide sufficient background in each of them without being excessively repetitious. Most recent printings of her Vorkosigan tales do include an appendix at the end of each book, summarizing the internal chronology of the series.\n\nBujold has discussed her own views on the optimum reading order for the Vorkosigan series in her blog.\n\nFantasy\n\nBujold also wanted to break into the fantasy genre, but met with early setbacks. Her first foray into fantasy was The Spirit Ring. She wrote the book \"on spec\", shopped it around, and found low offers, sending her back to Baen Books, where Jim Baen bought it for a fair price in exchange for the promise of more Vorkosigan books. Bujold called this experience very educational, combined with the mediocre sales of and lack of critical acclaim for that book.\n\nShe would not attempt to break into the fantasy market again for almost another decade, with The Curse of Chalion. This book was also written on spec and offered up to a book auction.  This time, she met with considerable critical and commercial success by tapping into a crossover market of fantasy and romance genre fans.  The fantasy world of Chalion was first conceived as a result of a University of Minnesota course she was taking about medieval Spain in her spare time.\n\nThe next fantasy world she created was the tetralogy set in the universe of The Sharing Knife, borrowing inspiration for its landscapes and for the dialect of the \"farmers\" from ones she grew up with in central Ohio.  She writes that her first readers who helped proofread it said she got it exactly right and they could recognize Ohio features in the descriptions and dialects.\n\nReception\n\nReviews\n\nSylvia Kelso, in the New York Review of Science Fiction, wrote in 1998: \n\nAwards\n\nHugo Awards\n\nWins\n* \"The Mountains of Mourning\" (1990)\n* The Vor Game (1991)\n* Barrayar (1992)\n* Mirror Dance (1995)\n* Paladin of Souls (2004)\n* Vorkosigan Saga (2017) Special Award for Best Series\n\nNominations\n* Falling Free (1989)\n* Memory (1997)\n* A Civil Campaign (2000)\n* The Curse of Chalion (2002)\n* \"Winterfair Gifts\" (2005)\n* Cryoburn (2011)\n* Captain Vorpatril's Alliance (2013)\n* \"Penric's Demon\" (2016)\n* \"Penric and the Shaman\" (2017)\n\nNebula Awards\n\nWins\n* Falling Free (1989)\n* \"The Mountains of Mourning\" (1990)\n* Paladin of Souls (2005)\n\nNominations\n* \"Weatherman\" (1991)\n* Barrayar (1992)\n* Memory (1998)\n* A Civil Campaign (2001)\n* Diplomatic Immunity (2004)\n\nLocus Awards\n\nBest Science Fiction Novel\n* Barrayar (1992)\n* Mirror Dance (1995)\n\nBest Fantasy Novel\n* Paladin of Souls (2004)\n\nJohn W.
