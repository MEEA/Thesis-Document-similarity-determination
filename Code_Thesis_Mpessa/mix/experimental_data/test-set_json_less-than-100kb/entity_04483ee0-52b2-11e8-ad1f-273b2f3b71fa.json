  "textBody" : "Greg Egan (born 20 August 1961) is an Australian science fiction writer.\n\nLife\n\nEgan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Western Australia.\n\nHe published his first work in 1983.  He specialises in hard science fiction stories with mathematical and quantum ontology themes, including the nature of consciousness. Other themes include genetics, simulated reality, posthumanism, mind uploading, sexuality, artificial intelligence, and the concept of rational naturalism being superior to religion. He is known for his tendency to deal with complex technical material, like inventive new physics and epistemology, in an unapologetically thorough manner. He is a Hugo Award winner (with eight other works shortlisted for the Hugos) and has also won the John W Campbell Memorial Award for Best Novel. His early stories feature strong elements of supernatural horror.\n\nEgan's short stories have been published in a variety of genre magazines, including regular appearances in Interzone and Asimov's Science Fiction.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs of 2015, Egan lives in Perth. He has been active on the issue of asylum seekers' mandatory detention in Australia.
