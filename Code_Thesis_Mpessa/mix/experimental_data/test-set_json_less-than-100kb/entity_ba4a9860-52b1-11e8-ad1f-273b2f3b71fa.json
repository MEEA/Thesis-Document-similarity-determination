  "textBody" : "Ahmed III (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثالث, Aḥmed-i sālis) (30/31 December 16731 July 1736) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648–87). His mother was Emetullah Rabia Gülnuş Sultan, originally named Evmania Voria, who was an ethnic Greek. He was born at Hacıoğlu Pazarcık, in Dobruja. He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother Mustafa II (1695–1703). Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha and the Sultan's daughter, Fatma Sultan (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the Tulip Era.\n\nBiography \n\nAhmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of Russia's menacing attitude. He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to Charles XII of Sweden (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of Peter I of Russia (1672–1725) in the Battle of Poltava of 1709. In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under Baltacı Mehmet Pasha won a major victory at the Battle of Prut. In the aftermath, Russia returned Azov back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nForced against his will into war with Russia, Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his grand vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711. The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached Istanbul that the Safavids were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.\n\nSultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian Patrona Halil, was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.\n\nAhmed voluntarily led his nephew Mahmud I (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the Kafes previously occupied by Mahmud and died at Topkapı Palace after six years of confinement.\n\nAhmed III's rule \n\nThe reign of Ahmed III lasted for twenty-seven years and was not unsuccessful. The recovery of Azov and the Morea, and the conquest of part of Persia, managed to counterbalance the Balkan territory ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18. In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture Corfu from the Republic of Venice but that expedition eventually failed,\n\nAhmed III left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated patron of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Istanbul, operated by Ibrahim Muteferrika (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).\n\nIt was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principalities was introduced: previously, the Porte had appointed Hospodars, usually native Moldavian and Wallachian boyars, to administer those provinces; after the Russian campaign of 1711, during which Peter the Great found an ally in Moldavia Prince Dimitrie Cantemir, the Porte began overtly deputizing Phanariote Greeks in that region, and extended the system to Wallachia after Prince Stefan Cantacuzino established links with Eugene of Savoy. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of Dhimmi nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.\n\nRelations with the Mughal Empire\n\nJahandar Shah\n\nIn the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah, a grandson of Aurangzeb sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan Ahmad III and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.\n\nFarrukhsiyar\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar a grandson of Aurangzeb, is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.\n\nFamily\n\n;Consorts\n* Emetullah Kadın (died 1739, buried in Eyüp Sultan Mosque);\n* Rukiye Kadın;\n* Mihrişah Kadın (died 1732, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Şermi Kadın (died 1732, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Ümmügülsüm Kadın (died 1768, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Hatice Kadın (buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Fatma Kadın (1732, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Emine Kadın (1757, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Hanife Kadın (1750, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul);\n* Musli Kadın;\n\n;Sons\n* Şehzade Mehmed (25 November 1705died in infancy);\n* Şehzade İsa (23 February 170625 May 1706);\n* Şehzade Ali (18 June 170612 September 1706);\n* Şehzade Selim (6 September 17074 May 1708);\n* Şehzade Murad (4 February 17081 April 1708);\n* Şehzade Abdülmelik (12 December 17097 March 1711);\n* Şehzade Süleyman (25 August 171011 December 1732), son of Mihrişah Kadın;\n* Şehzade Selim  (1715February 1718);\n* Şehzade Mehmed (1 January 1717murdered 22 December 1756);\n* Mustafa III (28 January 171721 January 1774), son of Mihrişah Kadın;\n* Şehzade Bayezid (4 October 171825 January 1771); \n* Şehzade Abdullah (18 December 171919 December 1719);\n* Şehzade Numan (22 February 172329 December 1764);\n* Abdul Hamid I (20 March 17257 April 1789), son of Şermi Kadın;\n* Şehzade Seyfeddin (3 February 17281732);\n\n;Daughters \n* Fatma Sultan (22 October 17043 January 1733), daughter of Emetullah Kadın. \n* Hatice Sultan (21 January 17071708);\n* Rukiye Sultan (3 May 170729 August 1707);\n* Zeynep Sultan (17085 October 1708);\n* Ümmügülsüm Sultan (1708November 1732);\n* Zeyneb Sultan (5 January 17101 August 1710);\n* Hatice Sultan (27 September 17101738), daughter of Rukiye Kadın;\n* Atike Sultan (17121737);\n* Ayşe Sultan (17133 October 1776), daughter of Emine Kadın;\n* Saliha Sultan (20 April 171511 October 1778); \n* Zeynep Sultan (171525 March 1774);\n* Rabia Sultan (19 November 1719died in infancy)\n* Emetullah Sultan (23 December 17195 February 1720);\n* Ümmüseleme Sultan (died 1732);\n* Emine Sultan (died 1732);\n* Naile Sultan (15 February 172510 December 1726);\n* Nazife Sultan (May 1525died in infancy);\n* Esma Sultan (14 March 172613 August 1788), daughter of Hanife Kadın;\n* Sabiha Sultan (26 November 17263 December 1726);\n* Rebia Sultan (4 August 17274 April 1728);\n* Zübeyde Sultan (29 March 17284 June 1756), daughter of Musli Kadın.\n\nIn fiction\n\nIn Voltaire's Candide, the eponymous main character meets the deposed Ahmed III on a ship from Venice to Constantinople.
