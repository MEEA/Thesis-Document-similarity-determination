He died at the age of 53 while aboard United Airlines Flight 175, which crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11 attacks.\n\nEarly life\n\nGarnet Edward \"Ace\" Bailey was born June 13, 1948 in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan. He was not related to Irvine \"Ace\" Bailey, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1926 to 1933.\n\nCareer\n\nBailey played junior hockey with the Edmonton Oil Kings from 1964 to 1967, during which time the Oil Kings won the Memorial Cup in 1966.  He joined the Boston Bruins in 1968 and was a member of their Stanley Cup championship teams in 1970 and 1972. He later played for the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues and the Washington Capitals. In 1978-79, Bailey returned to Edmonton to play with the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association, where he took rookie Wayne Gretzky under his wing. He was head coach of the Wichita Wind, the Oilers' Central Hockey League affiliate, in the 1980–81 season. Bailey then worked as a scout with the Oilers from 1981 to 1994, during which time the team won five Stanley Cups (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990); his name was engraved on three of them (1985, 1987 and 1990).\n\nIn an NHL career spanning 10 seasons and 568 games, Bailey scored 107 goals and 171 assists with 633 penalty minutes.

In his sole WHA season, he scored 5 goals and 4 assists with 22 penalty minutes in 38 games.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was the Kings' director of pro scouting.[http://www.nhl.com/ice/blogpost.htm?id\n11596# \"Kings' Sept. 11 victims get day with Cup\"].
