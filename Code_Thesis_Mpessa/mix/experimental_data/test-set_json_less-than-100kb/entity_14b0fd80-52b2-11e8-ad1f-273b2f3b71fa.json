  "textBody" : "Hypnotherapy is type of complementary and alternative medicine in which the mind is used in an attempt to help with a variety problems, such as breaking bad habits or coping with stress.\n\nIt is used for a wide variety of applications, and studies into its efficacy are often of poor quality which makes it difficult to determine efficacy. Several recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the literature on various conditions have concluded that the efficacy of hypnotherapy is \"not verified\", that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence for efficacy.\n\nDefinition \n\nThe Federal Dictionary of Occupational Titles describes the job of the hypnotherapist:\n\"Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior patterns: Consults with client to determine nature of problem. Prepares client to enter hypnotic state by explaining how hypnosis works and what client will experience. Tests subject to determine degree of physical and emotional suggestibility. Induces hypnotic state in client, using individualized methods and techniques of hypnosis based on interpretation of test results and analysis of client's problem. May train client in self-hypnosis conditioning.\nGOE: 10.02.02 STRENGTH: S GED: R4 M3 L4 SVP: 7 DLU: 77\"\n\nTraditional hypnotherapy\n\nThe form of hypnotherapy practiced by most Victorian hypnotists, including James Braid and Hippolyte Bernheim, mainly employed direct suggestion of symptom removal, with some use of therapeutic relaxation and occasionally aversion to alcohol, drugs, etc.\n\nEricksonian hypnotherapy\n\nIn the 1950s, Milton H. Erickson developed a radically different approach to hypnotism, which has subsequently become known as \"Ericksonian hypnotherapy\" or \"Neo-Ericksonian hypnotherapy.\"  Erickson made use of an informal conversational approach with many clients and complex language patterns, and therapeutic strategies.  This divergence from tradition led some of his colleagues, including Andre Weitzenhoffer, to dispute whether Erickson was right to label his approach \"hypnosis\" at all.\n\nThe founders of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), a methodology similar in some regards to hypnotism, claimed that they had modelled the work of Erickson extensively and assimilated it into their approach. Weitzenhoffer disputed whether NLP bears any genuine resemblance to Erickson's work.\n\nSolution focused hypnotherapy\n\nIn the 2000s, hypnotherapists began to combine aspects of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) with Ericksonian hypnotherapy to produce therapy that was goal focused (what the client wanted to achieve) rather than the more traditional problem focused approach (spending time discussing the issues that brought the client to seek help). A solution-focused hypnotherapy session may include techniques from NLP.http://afsfh.com/solution-focused-brief-therapy/\n\nCognitive/behavioral hypnotherapy\n\nCognitive behavioural hypnotherapy (CBH) is an integrated psychological therapy employing clinical hypnosis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The use of CBT in conjunction with hypnotherapy may result in greater treatment effectiveness. A meta-analysis of eight different researches revealed \"a 70% greater improvement\" for patients undergoing an integrated treatment to those using CBT only.\n\nIn 1974, Theodore X. Barber and his colleagues published a review of the research which argued, following the earlier social psychology of Theodore R. Sarbin, that hypnotism was better understood not as a \"special state\" but as the result of normal psychological variables, such as active imagination, expectation, appropriate attitudes, and motivation.  Barber introduced the term \"cognitive-behavioral\" to describe the nonstate theory of hypnotism, and discussed its application to behavior therapy.\n\nThe growing application of cognitive and behavioral psychological theories and concepts to the explanation of hypnosis paved the way for a closer integration of hypnotherapy with various cognitive and behavioral therapies.  \n\nMany cognitive and behavioral therapies were themselves originally influenced by older hypnotherapy techniques, e.g., the systematic desensitisation of Joseph Wolpe, the cardinal technique of early behavior therapy, was originally called \"hypnotic desensitisation\" and derived from the Medical Hypnosis (1948) of Lewis Wolberg.\n\nCurative hypnotherapy\n\nDavid Lesser  (1928 - 2001) was the originator of what we today understand by the term Curative Hypnotherapy.  It was he who first saw the possibility of finding the causes of people’s symptoms by using a combination of hypnosis, IMR and a method of specific questioning that he began to explore.  \nRather than try to override the subconscious information as Janet had done, he realised the necessity- and developed the process- to correct the wrong information.  Lesser’s understanding of the logicality and simplicity of the subconscious led to the creation of the methodical treatment used today and it is his innovative work and understanding that underpins the therapy and is why the term ‘Lesserian’ was coined and trademarked.\nAs the understanding of the workings of the subconscious continues to evolve, the application of the therapy continues to change.  The three most influential changes have been in Specific Questioning (1992) to gain more accurate subconscious information; a subconscious cause/effect mapping system (SRBC)(1996) to streamline the process of curative hypnotherapy treatment;  and the ‘LBR Criteria’ (2003) to be able to differentiate easier between causal and trigger events and helping to target more accurately the erroneous data which requires reinterpretation.\n\nUses\n\nChildbirth\n\nHypnotherapy is often applied in the birthing process and the post-natal period, but there is insufficient evidence to determine if it alleviates pain during childbirth and no evidence that it is effective against post-natal depression.\n\nBulimia\n\nLiterature shows that a wide variety of hypnotic interventions have been investigated for the treatment bulimia nervosa, with inconclusive effect. Similar studies have shown that groups suffering from bulimia nervosa, undergoing hypnotherapy, were more exceptional to no treatment, placebos, or other alternative treatments.\n\nOther uses\n\nAmong its many other applications in other medical domains, hypnotism was used therapeutically, by some alienists in the Victorian era, to treat the condition then known as hysteria.\n\nModern hypnotherapy is widely accepted for the treatment of certain habit disorders, to control irrational fears, as well as in the treatment of conditions such as insomnia and addiction. Hypnosis has also been used to enhance recovery from non-psychological conditions such as after surgical procedures, in breast cancer care and even with gastro-intestinal problems, including IBS.\n\nEfficacy\n\nA 2003 meta-analysis on the efficacy of hypnotherapy concluded that \"the efficacy of hypnosis is not verified for a considerable part of the spectrum of psychotherapeutic practice.\n\nIn 2005, a meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration found no evidence that hypnotherapy was more successful than other treatments or no treatment in achieving cessation of smoking for at least six months.Abbot NC, Stead LF, White AR, Barnes J. Hypnotherapy for smoking cessation\" Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD001008. \n\nIn 2007, a meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration found that the therapeutic effect of hypnotherapy was \"superior to that of a waiting list control or usual medical management, for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms, in the short term in patients who fail standard medical therapy\", with no harmful side-effects. However the authors noted that the quality of data available was inadequate to draw any firm conclusions.Webb AN, Kukuruzovic R, Catto-Smith AG, Sawyer SM. Hypnotherapy for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome\" Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD005110. \n\nTwo Cochrane reviews in 2012 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support its efficacy in managing the pain of childbirth or post-natal depression.\n\nIn 2016, a literature review published in La Presse Medicale found that there is not sufficient evidence to \"support the efficacy of hypnosis in chronic anxiety disorders\".\n\nOccupational accreditation\n\nUnited States definition of hypnotherapist\n\nThe U.S. (Department of Labor) Directory of Occupational Titles (D.O.T. 079.157.010) supplies the following definition:\n\"Hypnotherapist – Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior pattern through hypnosis.

Yeates, the Australian Hypnotherapists Associationhttp://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au (founded in 1949), the oldest hypnotism-oriented professional organization in Australia, instituted a peer-group accreditation system for full-time Australian professional hypnotherapists, the first of its kind in the world, which \"accredit[ed] specific individuals on the basis of their actual demonstrated knowledge and clinical performance; instead of approving particular 'courses' or approving particular 'teaching institutions'\" (Yeates, 1996, p.iv; 1999, p.xiv).The accreditation criteria and the structure of the accreditation system were based on those described in Yeates, Lindsay B., A Set of Competency and Proficiency Standards for Australian Professional Clinical Hypnotherapists: A Descriptive Guide to the Australian Hypnotherapists' Association Accreditation System, Australian Hypnotherapists' Association, (Sydney), 1996.
