  "textBody" : "The Fresnel equations (or Fresnel conditions), deduced by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, describe the behaviour of light when moving between media of differing refractive indices. The reflection of light that the equations predict is known as Fresnel reflection.\n\nOverview\n\nWhen light moves from a medium of a given refractive index, n1, into a second medium with refractive index, n2, both reflection and refraction of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations describe what fraction of the light is reflected and what fraction is refracted (i.e., transmitted). They also describe the phase shift of the reflected light.\n\nThe equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous. The incident light is assumed to be a plane wave, and effects of edges are neglected.\n\nS and p polarizations\n\nThe behavior depends on the polarization of the incident ray, which can be separated into 2 cases:\n;s-polarized (perpendicular) or TE: The incident light is polarized with its electric field perpendicular to the plane containing the incident, reflected, and refracted rays. This plane is called the plane of incidence; it is the plane of the diagram below. The light is said to be s-polarized, from the German, senkrecht, meaning perpendicular.\n;p-polarized (parallel) or TM: The incident light is polarized with its electric field parallel to the plane of incidence. Such light is described as p-polarized, from parallel.\n\nPower or intensity equations\n\nIn the diagram on the right, an incident light ray, IO, strikes the interface between two media of refractive indices n1 and n2 at point, O. Part of the ray is reflected as ray OR, and part refracted as ray OT. The angles that the incident, reflected and refracted rays make to the normal of the interface are given as θi, θr and θt, respectively.\n\nThe relationship between these angles is given by the law of reflection:\n\\theta_\\mathrm{i} = \\theta_\\mathrm{r},\n\nand Snell's law:\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{i} = n_2 \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{t}.\n\nThe fraction of the incident power that is reflected from the interface is given by the reflectance or reflectivity, R, and the fraction that is refracted is given by the transmittance or transmissivity, T, (unrelated to the transmission through a medium). \n\nThe reflectance for s-polarized light is\n\n  R_\\mathrm{s} = \\left|\\frac{Z_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} - Z_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}{Z_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} + Z_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}\\right|^2\n               = \\left|\\frac\n                         {\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\epsilon_2}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\epsilon_1}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}\n                         {\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\epsilon_2}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\epsilon_1}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}\n                 \\right|^2,\n\nwhile the reflectance for p-polarized light is\n\n  R_\\mathrm{p} = \\left|\\frac{Z_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} - Z_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}{Z_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} + Z_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\\right|^2\n               = \\left|\\frac\n                         {\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\epsilon_2}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\epsilon_1}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\n                         {\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\epsilon_2}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\epsilon_1}} \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\n                 \\right|^2,\n\nwhere Z1 and Z2 are the wave impedances of media 1 and 2, respectively, μ1 and μ2 are the magnetic permeabilities of the two materials, and ε1 and ε2 are the electric permittivities of the two materials (at the frequency of the light wave). \n\nFor non-magnetic media (i.e. materials for which , where μ0 is the permeability of free space), we have\nZ_1 \\frac{Z_0}{n_1},\\ Z_2 \n \\frac{Z_0}{n_2}.\n\nThen, the reflectance for s-polarized light becomes\n\n  R_\\mathrm{s} = \\left|\\frac{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} - n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t}}\\right|^2\n               = \\left|\\frac\n                         {n_1 \\cos \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}} - n_2 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)^2}}\n                         {n_1 \\cos \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}} + n_2 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)^2}}\n                 \\right|^2\\!,\n\nwhile the reflectance for p-polarized light becomes\n\n  R_\\mathrm{p} = \\left|\\frac{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} - n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{t} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\\right|^2\n               = \\left|\\frac\n                         {n_1 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{i}\\right)^2} - n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\n                         {n_1 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{i}\\right)^2} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{i}}\n                 \\right|^2\\!.\n\nThe second form of each equation is derived from the first by eliminating θt using Snell's law and trigonometric identities.\n\nAs a consequence of the conservation of energy, the transmittances are given by\nT_\\mathrm{s} = 1 - R_\\mathrm{s}\n\nand\nT_\\mathrm{p} = 1 - R_\\mathrm{p}\n\nThese relationships hold only for power or intensity, not for complex amplitude transmission and reflection coefficients as defined below.\n\nIf the incident light is unpolarised (containing an equal mix of s and p polarisations), the reflectance is\nR = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(R_\\mathrm{s} + R_\\mathrm{p}\\right).\n\nFor common glass, with n2 around 1.5, the reflectance at θi = 0 is about 4%. Note that reflection by a window is from the front side as well as the back side, and that some of the light bounces back and forth a number of times between the two sides. The combined reflectance for this case is ), when interference can be neglected (see below).\n\nThe discussion given here assumes that the permeability, μ, is equal to the vacuum permeability, μ0, in both media, embodying the assumption that the material is non-magnetic. This is approximately true for most dielectric materials, but not for some other types of material. The completely general Fresnel equations are more complicated. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/book/10.1081/E-EOE\n\nFor low-precision applications where polarization may be ignored, such as computer graphics, Schlick's approximation may be used.\n\nSpecial cases\n\nNormal incidence\n\nFor the case of normal incidence,  \\theta_\\mathrm{i} \\theta_\\mathrm{t} \n 0, and there is no distinction between s and p polarization.  Thus, the reflectance simplifies to\n\nR = \\left|\\frac{n_1  - n_2 }{n_1 + n_2 }\\right|^2\n.\n\nBrewster's angle and total internal reflection\n\nAt one particular angle for a given  and , the value of  goes to zero and a p-polarised incident ray is purely refracted. This angle is known as Brewster's angle, and is around 56° for a glass medium in air or vacuum.  This statement is only true when the refractive indices of both materials are real numbers, which is the case for materials such as air and glass.  For materials that absorb light, such as metals and semiconductors,  is complex, and  does not generally go to zero.\n\nWhen moving from a denser medium into a less dense one (i.e., ), above an incidence angle known as the critical angle, all light is reflected and . This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection.  The critical angle occurs when the angle of incidence  results in an angle of transmission , and is approximately 41° for glass in air.\n\nMagnetic materials\n\nFor magnetic materials there exists the special case where the real refractive indices of the two media are equal, , but the magnetic permeabilities are unequal. In this case the reflected ray is independent of the incident polarization and of the angle of incidence, and the magnitude of the reflection is constant except at grazing incidence.\n\nAmplitude or field equations\n\nEquations for coefficients corresponding to ratios of the electric field complex-valued amplitudes of the waves (not necessarily real-valued magnitudes) are also called Fresnel equations. These take several different forms, depending on the choice of formalism and sign convention used. The amplitude coefficients are usually represented by lower case r and t.\n\nConventions used here\n\nIn this treatment, the coefficient  is the ratio of the reflected wave's complex electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. The coefficient  is the ratio of the transmitted wave's electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. The light is split into s and p polarizations as defined above. (In the figures to the right, s polarization is denoted \"\\scriptstyle \\bot\" and p is denoted \"\\scriptstyle \\parallel\".)\n\nFor s polarization, a positive  or  means that the electric fields of the incoming and reflected or transmitted wave are parallel, while negative means anti-parallel. For p polarization, a positive  or  means that the magnetic fields of the waves are parallel, while negative means anti-parallel.Lecture notes by Bo Sernelius, [http://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYY67/ main site], see especially [http://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYY67/Lect12.pdf Lecture 12]. It is also assumed that the magnetic permeability, , of both media is equal to the permeability of free space .\n\n(Some authors use the opposite sign convention for , so that  is positive when the incoming and reflected magnetic fields are anti-parallel, and negative when they are parallel. This latter convention has the convenient advantage that the s and p sign conventions are the same at normal incidence. However, either convention, when used consistently, gives the right answers.)\n\nFormulas\n\nUsing the arbitrary sign conventions above,\n\n\\begin{align}\n  r_\\text{s} &\\frac{  n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i} - n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}} \n t_\\text{s} - 1, \\\\[3pt]\n  t_\\text{s} &\\frac{2 n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}}                           {n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}} \n r_\\text{s} + 1, \\\\[3pt]\n  r_\\text{p} &= \\frac{  n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i} - n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}}, \\\\[3pt]\n  t_\\text{p} &= \\frac{2 n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}}                           {n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t} + n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}}.\n\\end{align}\n\nNotice that . Instead .\n\nBecause the reflected and incident waves propagate in the same medium and make the same angle with the normal to the surface, the amplitude reflection coefficient is related to the reflectance  by\nR = |r|^2.\n\nThe transmittance  is generally not equal to , since the light travels with different direction and speed in the two media. The transmittance is related to  by:\nT = \\frac{n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\text{t}}{n_1 \\cos \\theta_\\text{i}} |t|^2.\n\nThe factor of  occurs from the ratio of intensities (closely related to irradiance). The factor of  represents the change in area  of the pencil of rays, needed since , the ratio of powers, is equal to the ratio of (intensity × area). In terms of the ratio of refractive indices, \n\\rho = \\frac{n_2}{n_1},\n\nand of the magnification  of the beam cross section occurring at the interface,\nT = \\rho m |t|^2.\n\nIn the case of total internal reflection,  and  are complex numbers representing the evanescent wave. This accounts for non-zero values of  and  seen in the graph 'Amplitude ratios: glass to air'.\n\nMultiple surfaces\n\nWhen light makes multiple reflections between two or more parallel surfaces, the multiple beams of light generally interfere with one another, resulting in net transmission and reflection amplitudes that depend on the light's wavelength. The interference, however, is seen only when the surfaces are at distances comparable to or smaller than the light's coherence length, which for ordinary white light is few micrometers; it can be much larger for light from a laser.\n\nAn example of interference between reflections is the iridescent colours seen in a soap bubble or in thin oil films on water. Applications include Fabry–Pérot interferometers, antireflection coatings, and optical filters.
