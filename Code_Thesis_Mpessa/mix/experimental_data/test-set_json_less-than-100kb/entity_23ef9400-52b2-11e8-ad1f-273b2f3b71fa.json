  "textBody" : "Jonathan Turner Meades (born 21 January 1947) is an English writer and film-maker, primarily on the subjects of place, culture, architecture and food. His work has spanned journalism, fiction, memoir and over 50 highly idiosyncratic television films, mostly for the BBC.\n\nHe has described himself as a \"cardinal of atheism\" and is both an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Patron of Humanists UK.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMeades was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the only child of John William Meades, a biscuit company rep, and Margery Agnes Meades (née Hogg), a schoolteacher. As a small boy, he often accompanied his father on sales trips and was left unattended to wander around various southern English towns while the elder Meades conducted his business. It was on these trips that he discovered a fascination for place and the built environment which would develop into a life-long passion. He also developed an early love of France due to frequent family holidays there, made possible by his Francophile mother's father, who worked for the company which ran the Saint-Malo ferry.\n\nHe was educated at Salisbury Cathedral School until the age of 13 and then as a boarder at King's College, Taunton, which he described as \"a dim, backward, muscular Christian boot camp\". He later \"walked out\" of the school and was sent instead to a crammer in London, where he lodged with the painter Vivien White, daughter of Augustus John.Meades, Jonathan (2014). An Encyclopaedia of Myself, p. 297, 331-333. Fourth Estate, London. .\n\nAfter spending some time in France and unsure of what to do next, he decided to become an actor after a chance meeting with Charles Collingwood and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1966 to 1969.Meades, Jonathan (2014). An Encyclopaedia of Myself, p. 341. Fourth Estate, London. . His contemporaries there included Robert Lindsay, David Bradley, Stephanie Beacham, Michael Kitchen and Richard Beckinsale. Although the experience ultimately deterred him from joining the profession, it was pivotal to his later television career. During his time at RADA he became friends with the painter Duggie Fields, whose flatmate was the former Pink Floyd singer, songwriter and guitarist Syd Barrett. He was also friendly with Aubrey \"Po\" Powell, co-founder of the graphic design company Hipgnosis.\n\nWriting\n\nMeades began writing for the now-defunct literary magazine Books & Bookmen in 1971, setting him on a career as a journalist and critic. In 1973 he reviewed a V&A exhibition on Victorian architecture for the magazine, igniting a passion for the style and prompting him to explore more of London than he had to date. Using the unlimited travel afforded by Red Rover bus passes, he rode on random buses for exactly 20 minutes and then got off, no matter where he was. He left Books and Bookmen in 1975 and wrote for the sex education magazine Curious and for Time Out  before becoming The Observers TV critic in 1977. This led to the publication of his first book, This Is Their Life, an A to Z of TV star biographies with an introduction by Mike Yarwood.Meades, Jonathan (1979). This Is Their Life. Salamander, London. . He moved to Architects' Journal in 1979, during which time he worked on another book, The Illustrated Atlas of the World's Great Buildings, with Philip Bagenal.Bagenal, Philip & Meades, Jonathan (1980). The Illustrated Atlas of the World's Great Buildings. Salamander, London. . In 1981 he became Editor of Richard Branson's short-lived listings magazine Event, then from 1982 was Features Editor at Tatler. He joined The Times in 1986 and was its restaurant critic until 2001, winning Best Food Journalist at the 1999 Glenfiddich Awards. He also contributed features and reviews to numerous other publications over the years; in the 2010s these included The Spectator, The Guardian, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph, amongst others.\n\nIn the early 1980s Meades wrote several short stories about \"rural lowlife\" for Harpers & Queen, collected in 1984 as Filthy English. Andrew Billen of the London Evening Standard later described them as \"bucolic horror stories\". More stories, mixed with journalism, appeared in the 1989 anthology Peter Knows What Dick Likes.\n\nHe contributed to the screenplay of the 1992 French-Italian adventure film L'Atlantide, directed by Bob Swaim, and also wrote three unproduced screenplays in the 1980s and 90s: Millie's Problem (1985), The Side I Dressed On (1987) and The Brute's Price (1996).\n\nHis first novel, Pompey, published in 1993, was widely praised and favourably compared to Sterne, Scarfe, Steadman, Dickens and Joyce, amongst other \"great stylists\". On its 2013 reissue, Matthew Adams wrote in The Independent, \"Where his first collection of stories, Filthy English, achieved the distinction of covering in aggressively vivid prose the disciplines of murder, addiction, incest and bestial pornography, Pompey exhibits an even greater concentration of his aptitude for squalor [...] by the end of the opening two pages, which must rank among the most startling affirmations of omniscience in 20th-century literature, the reader has met with an arresting injunction: \"After using this book please wash your hands.\"\"\n\nA second novel, The Fowler Family Business, followed in 2002. A tale of suburban sexual deceit, it was described by the London Evening Standard as \"hilarious and very black\". An anthology of his Times restaurant reviews, Incest and Morris Dancing: A Gastronomic Revolution, was published in the same year.\n\nIn 2012, an anthology of essays and TV scripts on the built environment, Museum Without Walls, was published by the crowd-funded imprint Unbound.\n\nMeades' memoir of his childhood in the 1950s and early 1960s, An Encyclopaedia of Myself, was published in May 2014. It was long-listed for that year's Samuel Johnson Prize and won Best Memoir in the Spear's Book Awards 2014. Roger Lewis of the Financial Times said of the work that \"If this book is thought of less as a memoir than as a symphonic poem about post-war England and Englishness - well, then it is a masterpiece.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Independent, he revealed that he was working on a third novel.\n\nIn 2015, the publisher and record label Test Centre released a spoken word vinyl album by Meades entitled Pedigree Mongrel, consisting of readings from his books Pompey, Museum Without Walls and An Encyclopaedia of Myself combined with soundscapes created by Mordant Music. The sleeve of the album featured photography by Meades, including an abstract self-portrait on the front cover.\n\nA book of \"borrowed\" recipes, The Plagiarist in the Kitchen, was published by Unbound in 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, Meades was invited to speak at the annual dinner of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.  In his speech he declared that \"the arts have usurped art\" and denounced the seizure of power by \"a managerial caste which exercises patronage, commissions rather than creates, edits rather than makes, inflicts its off-the-peg taste, does deals and builds empires\", excepting from his criticism, however, the Royal Academy itself, which is, he said, \"founded by artists and which is to this day run by artists in the interests of artists.\"  An edited version of the text was published in the TLS as In the Loop.\n\nBibliography\n\n*This Is Their Life (Salamander, 1979)  (biographies of TV personalities)\n*The Illustrated Atlas of the World's Great Buildings (Salamander, 1980)  (with Philip Bagenal)\n*Filthy English (Jonathan Cape, 1984)  (short stories)\n*English Extremists: The Architecture of Campbell Zogolovitch Wilkinson Gough (Fourth Estate, 1988)  (with Deyan Sudjic and Peter Cook)\n*Peter Knows What Dick Likes (Paladin, 1989)  (essays, reviews & short stories)\n*Pompey (Vintage, 1993)  (novel)\n\n*\"The Times\" Restaurant Guide 2002 (Cassell) \n*Incest and Morris Dancing: A Gastronomic Revolution (Cassell, 2002)  (food journalism)\n*The Fowler Family Business (Fourth Estate, 2002)  (novel)\n*Museum Without Walls (Unbound, 2012)  (essays & TV scripts on the built environment)\n*Pidgin Snaps: A Boxette of 100 Postcards (Unbound, 2013)  (photographs)\n*An Encyclopaedia of Myself (Fourth Estate, 2014)  (memoir)\n*The Plagiarist in the Kitchen (Unbound, 2017)  (recipes)\n\nTelevision\n\nMeades' first foray into television was in 1985: a short film on the art and architecture of Barcelona for the BBC Two arts magazine programme Saturday Review. His first major project was presenting the 1987 six-part Channel 4 documentary series The Victorian House. The writing credit for this went to the producer, John Marshall, and it was not a happy experience for Meades. He would be credited as the sole author of all his subsequent television work.\n\nHis next series was the five-part Abroad in Britain, broadcast on BBC Two in 1990. Influenced somewhat by Ian Nairn, these innovative, irreverent, \"slightly bonkers\" films explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment such as informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with bohemians, Utopianism and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being \"devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home.\" They cemented his unique on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and comic or surreal interludes, mostly performed by Meades himself. Preferring to be thought of as a performer rather than as a presenter, he described his style as \"heavy entertainment\"; \"staged essays\" which seek to combine \"lecture hall\" and \"music hall\", Geoffrey Hill and Benny Hill. The series spawned four sequels: Further Abroad (1994), Even Further Abroad (1997), Abroad Again in Britain (2005) and  Abroad Again (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films.\n\nOver a period of 22 years, he wrote and presented a trilogy of films on the architectural legacy of 20th century European dictators: Jerry Building (Nazi Germany, 1994), Joe Building (Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, 2006) and Ben Building (Benito Mussolini's Italy, 2016).\n\nHis 2001 film tvSSFBM EHKL: suREAL FILM sought to expound on surrealism in a manner befitting the subject, whilst also reflecting, inter alia, on the fact that he had recently lost a considerable amount of weight. As with many of Meades' films from around this time, the actor Christopher Biggins featured in a variety of comic roles.\n\nA three-part series on food culture, Meades Eats, aired in 2003, again featuring Biggins. The episodes dealt with fast food, the notion of a gastronomic revolution in the UK and with the ever-increasing influence of immigrant cuisines.\n\nThe 2008 two-part film Magnetic North celebrated the culture of Northern Europe, examining why the North suffers in the British popular imagination in comparison with the South. Meades travelled from the slag heaps of northern France to Belgian cities, the red-light district of Hamburg, Gdańsk, the Baltic States and finally Helsinki, musing on the architecture, food and art of the places he visited. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, James Walton praised the programme as \"Sparkling, thought-provoking, constantly challenging the accepted view, Meades seemed at times inspired, at others deranged. The only thing he never was, thank heaven, was obvious.\"\n\nA 9-DVD box set collecting all of his BBC work to date was planned for release in April 2008, but was then reduced to a 3-disc anthology due to the expense of licensing the music used in the programmes. Much of the carefully chosen popular music used in the original edits was replaced by library music, and the more music-dependent films such as Surreal Film, Victoria Died in 1901 and Heart Bypass were not included.\n\nIn 2009, Meades toured Scotland in a three-part BBC Four series entitled Off Kilter. He visited Aberdeen, the \"Isle of Rust\" (Lewis and Harris) and a number of less-renowned Scottish footballing towns, guided by his \"Scotnav\".\n\nIn 2012, BBC Four screened Jonathan Meades on France, a series in which he explored what he called his \"second country\". The first episode, Fragments of an Arbitrary Encyclopaedia, focused on the Lorraine region, using a miscellany of words beginning with the letter V. The second episode, A Biased Anthology of Parisian Peripheries, focused on Frenchness and its major traits. The series concluded with Just a Few Debts France Owes to America.\n\nThe 2013 film The Joy of Essex examined that county's little-known history of utopian communities.\n\nA two-part series on Brutalist architecture, Bunkers, Brutalism, Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry, aired in 2014.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with The Guardian, Meades described how his production budgets had declined over the years: \"We used to be a convoy, now we are a smart car\". In a 2008 interview with The Independent, he indicated that the blame for this lay mostly with former BBC Two controller Jane Root.\n\nHis current television projects are Jonathan Meades on Jargon, due in 2018, and a film on the buildings of Franco's Spain.\n\nFilmography\n\n*Saturday Review (30 mins, 1985-1987, BBC Two)\n*#Segment on the art and architecture of Barcelona\n*#Segment on the art and architecture of Amsterdam\n*The Victorian House (6 x 26 mins, 1987, Channel 4)\n*#Where Do Houses Come From?\n*#How It Was Done\n*#Steps Beyond the Door\n*#The Home Within\n*#The Way It Is\n*#Time and Change\n*Building Sights: Marsh Court (10 mins, 1988, BBC Two)\n*Abroad in Britain (5 x 30 mins, 1990, BBC Two)\n*#Severn Heaven (plotland shacks)\n*#Right is Wrong (the Utopian avoidance of right angles)\n*# House Ahoy!

Published by Unbound as a \"boxette\" of 100 postcards, it featured mostly abstract digital work. It was followed in April 2016 by an exhibition entitled \"Ape Forgets Medication: Treyfs and Artknacks\" at the Londonewcastle Project in Shoreditch, London. A second exhibition, \"After Medication: Random Treyfs and Artknacks\" was held in October 2017 at 108 Fine Art, Harrogate.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMeades has been married three times and has four grown-up daughters. After 40 years of living in London, he moved to France with his third wife in 2006, initially to the countryside near Bordeaux and then to Marseille, where they live in Le Corbusier's Cité Radieuse apartment block.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with the BBC's Mark Lawson, he estimated that he had put on 5 pounds per year during his 15 years as The Times restaurant critic (1986-2001), which worked out at around one ounce per meal. By the end of his tenure he had been pronounced morbidly obese and managed to lose a third of his body weight over the next year using a strict diet of only protein and citrus. \n\nIn the autumn of 2016 he was rushed to hospital and underwent five hours of cardiac surgery. Earlier in the year he had suffered from pleurisy and an embolism.",

Meades travelled from the slag heaps of northern France to Belgian cities, the red-light district of Hamburg, Gdańsk, the Baltic States and finally Helsinki, musing on the architecture, food and art of the places he visited. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, James Walton praised the programme as \"Sparkling, thought-provoking, constantly challenging the accepted view, Meades seemed at times inspired, at others deranged. The only thing he never was, thank heaven, was obvious.\"\n\nA 9-DVD box set collecting all of his BBC work to date was planned for release in April 2008, but was then reduced to a 3-disc anthology due to the expense of licensing the music used in the programmes. Much of the carefully chosen popular music used in the original edits was replaced by library music, and the more music-dependent films such as Surreal Film, Victoria Died in 1901 and Heart Bypass were not included.\n\nIn 2009, Meades toured Scotland in a three-part BBC Four series entitled Off Kilter. He visited Aberdeen, the \"Isle of Rust\" (Lewis and Harris) and a number of less-renowned Scottish footballing towns, guided by his \"Scotnav\".\n\nIn 2012, BBC Four screened Jonathan Meades on France, a series in which he explored what he called his \"second country\". The first episode, Fragments of an Arbitrary Encyclopaedia, focused on the Lorraine region, using a miscellany of words beginning with the letter V. The second episode, A Biased Anthology of Parisian Peripheries, focused on Frenchness and its major traits. The series concluded with Just a Few Debts France Owes to America.\n\nThe 2013 film The Joy of Essex examined that county's little-known history of utopian communities.\n\nA two-part series on Brutalist architecture, Bunkers, Brutalism, Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry, aired in 2014.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with The Guardian, Meades described how his production budgets had declined over the years: \"We used to be a convoy, now we are a smart car\". In a 2008 interview with The Independent, he indicated that the blame for this lay mostly with former BBC Two controller Jane Root.\n\nHis current television projects are Jonathan Meades on Jargon, due in 2018, and a film on the buildings of Franco's Spain.\n\nFilmography\n\n*Saturday Review (30 mins, 1985-1987, BBC Two)\n*#Segment on the art and architecture of Barcelona\n*#Segment on the art and architecture of Amsterdam\n*The Victorian House (6 x 26 mins, 1987, Channel 4)\n*#Where Do Houses Come From?\n*#How It Was Done\n*#Steps Beyond the Door\n*#The Home Within\n*#The Way It Is\n*#Time and Change\n*Building Sights: Marsh Court (10 mins, 1988, BBC Two)\n*Abroad in Britain (5 x 30 mins, 1990, BBC Two)\n*#Severn Heaven (plotland shacks)\n*#Right is Wrong (the Utopian avoidance of right angles)\n*# House Ahoy!

Published by Unbound as a \"boxette\" of 100 postcards, it featured mostly abstract digital work. It was followed in April 2016 by an exhibition entitled \"Ape Forgets Medication: Treyfs and Artknacks\" at the Londonewcastle Project in Shoreditch, London. A second exhibition, \"After Medication: Random Treyfs and Artknacks\" was held in October 2017 at 108 Fine Art, Harrogate.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMeades has been married three times and has four grown-up daughters. After 40 years of living in London, he moved to France with his third wife in 2006, initially to the countryside near Bordeaux and then to Marseille, where they live in Le Corbusier's Cité Radieuse apartment block.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with the BBC's Mark Lawson, he estimated that he had put on 5 pounds per year during his 15 years as The Times restaurant critic (1986-2001), which worked out at around one ounce per meal. By the end of his tenure he had been pronounced morbidly obese and managed to lose a third of his body weight over the next year using a strict diet of only protein and citrus. \n\nIn the autumn of 2016 he was rushed to hospital and underwent five hours of cardiac surgery. Earlier in the year he had suffered from pleurisy and an embolism. Jonathan Meades. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=16135."
