  "textBody" : "In chemistry, concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration. The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration. \n\nQualitative description\n\nOften in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as \"dilute\" for solutions of relatively low concentration and \"concentrated\" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of solvent (for example, water). By contrast, to dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are fully miscible there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be saturated. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when supersaturation may occur. Instead, phase separation will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a suspension. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.\n\nConcentrations are often called levels, reflecting the mental schema of levels on the vertical axis of a graph, which can be high or low (for example, \"high serum levels of bilirubin\" are concentrations of bilirubin in the blood serum that are greater than normal).\n\nQuantitative notation\n\nThere are four quantities that describe concentration:\n\nMass concentration\n\nThe mass concentration \\rho_i is defined as the mass of a constituent m_i divided by the volume of the mixture V:\n\n\\rho_i = \\frac {m_i}{V}.\n\nThe SI unit is kg/m3 (equal to g/L).\n\nMolar concentration\n\nThe molar concentration c_i is defined as the amount of a constituent n_i (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture V:\n\nc_i = \\frac {n_i}{V}.\n\nThe SI unit is mol/m3. However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm3) is used.\n\nNumber concentration\n\nThe number concentration C_i is defined as the number of entities of a constituent N_i in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture V:\n\nC_i = \\frac{N_i}{V}.\n\nThe SI unit is 1/m3.\n\nVolume concentration\n\nThe volume concentration \\phi_i (do not confuse with volume fraction) is defined as the volume of a constituent V_i divided by the volume of the mixture V:\n\n\\phi_i = \\frac {V_i}{V}.\n\nBeing dimensionless, it is expressed as a number, e.g., 0.18 or 18%; its unit is 1.\n\nRelated quantities\n\nSeveral other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. Note that these should not be called concentrations.\n\nNormality\n\nNormality is defined as the molar concentration c_i divided by an equivalence factor f_\\mathrm{eq}. Since the definition of the equivalence factor depends on context (which reaction is being studied), IUPAC and NIST discourage the use of normality.\n\nMolality\n\n(Not to be confused with Molarity)\n\nThe molality of a solution b_i is defined as the amount of a constituent n_i (in moles) divided by the mass of the solvent m_\\mathrm{solvent} (not the mass of the solution):\n\nb_i = \\frac{n_i}{m_\\mathrm{solvent}}.\n\nThe SI unit for molality is mol/kg.\n\nMole fraction\n\nThe mole fraction x_i is defined as the amount of a constituent n_i (in moles) divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture n_\\mathrm{tot}:\n\nx_i = \\frac {n_i}{n_\\mathrm{tot}}.\n\nThe SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole fractions.\n\nMole ratio\n\nThe mole ratio r_i is defined as the amount of a constituent n_i divided by the total amount of all other constituents in a mixture:\n\nr_i = \\frac{n_i}{n_\\mathrm{tot}-n_i}.\n\nIf n_i is much smaller than n_\\mathrm{tot}, the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction.\n\nThe SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole ratios.\n\nMass fraction\n\nThe mass fraction w_i is the fraction of one substance with mass m_i to the mass of the total mixture m_\\mathrm{tot}, defined as:\n\nw_i = \\frac {m_i}{m_\\mathrm{tot}}.\n\nThe SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass fractions.\n\nMass ratio\n\nThe mass ratio \\zeta_i is defined as the mass of a constituent m_i divided by the total mass of all other constituents in a mixture:\n\n\\zeta_i = \\frac{m_i}{m_\\mathrm{tot}-m_i}.\n\nIf m_i is much smaller than m_\\mathrm{tot}, the mass ratio is almost identical to the mass fraction.\n\nThe SI unit is kg/kg.
