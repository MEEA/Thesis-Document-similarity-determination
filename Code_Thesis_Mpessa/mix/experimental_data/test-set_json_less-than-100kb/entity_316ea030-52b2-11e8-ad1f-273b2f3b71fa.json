  "textBody" : "Loa (also spelled lwa) are the spirits of Haitian Vodou and Louisiana Voodoo.Anthony B. Pinn. \"The African American Religious Experience in America\" Greenwood Press, 2005, pg 229. They are also referred to as \"mystères\" and \"the invisibles\" and are intermediaries between Bondye (French: Bon Dieu, meaning \"good God\")—the Supreme Creator, who is distant from the world—and humanity. Unlike saints or angels, however, they are not simply prayed to, they are served. They are each distinct beings with their own personal likes and dislikes, distinct sacred rhythms, songs, dances, ritual symbols, and special modes of service. Contrary to popular belief, the loa are not deities in and of themselves; they are intermediaries for, and dependent on, a distant Bondye.Anthony B. Pinn. \"The African American Religious Experience in America\" Greenwood Press, 2005, pg 219.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word loa (or lwa) comes from the French \"les lois\"; the laws in English.\n\nSyncretism\n\nThe enslaved Fon and Ewe in Haiti and Louisiana syncretized the loa with the Roman Catholic Saints—vodoun altars will frequently display images of Catholic saints. For example, Papa Legba is syncretized with St. Peter or St. Lazarus.\nSyncretism also works the other way in Haitian Vodou and many Catholic saints have become loa in their own right, most notably Philomena, St. Michael the Archangel, St. Jude, and John the Baptist.\n\nRituals\n\nIn a ritual the loa are called down by the houngan (priest), mambo (priestess), or bokor (sorcerers) to take part in the service, receive offerings, and grant requests. The loa arrive in the peristyle (ritual space) by mounting (possessing) a horse (ritualist) in Creole referred as \"Chwal\"—who is said to be \"ridden\". This can be quite a violent occurrence as the participant can flail about or convulse before falling to the ground, but some loa, such as Ayizan, will mount their \"horses\" very quietly.\n\nCertain loa display very distinctive behaviour by which they can be recognized, specific phrases, and specific actions. As soon as a loa is recognized, the symbols appropriate to them will be given to them. For example, Erzulie Freda will be given a glass of pink champagne, she is sprinkled with her perfumes, fine gifts of food will be presented to her or she even puts on her jewelry; Legba will be given his cane, straw hat, and pipe; Baron Samedi will often fall flat on the floor and the vodousants around him will dress him and prepare him as they do in a morgue with cotton in his nose.\n\nOnce the loa have arrived, fed, been served, and possibly given help or advice, they leave the peristyle. Certain loa can become obstinate, for example the Ghede are notorious for wanting just one more smoke, or one more drink, but it is the job of the houngan or mambo to keep the spirits in line while ensuring they are adequately provided for.\n\nNanchons\n\nThere are many families or \"nanchons\" (from \"nations\") of loa: Rada (also Radha), Petro (also Pethro, Petwo), Nago, Kongo, and Ghede (also Guede, or Gede), among others.\n\nRada loa\n\nThe Rada loa are generally older, as many of these spirits come from Africa and the kingdom of Dahomey. The Rada Loa are mainly water spirits and many of the Rada loa are served with a water. The Rada are \"Cool\" in the sense they are less aggressive than the Petwo. They include Legba, Loko, Ayizan, Dhamballah Wedo and Ayida-Weddo, Erzulie Freda, La Sirène, and Agwé. Many of these spirits are served with white (as opposed to the specific colours of individual loa).\n\nPetro loa\n\nThe Petro loa are generally the more fiery, occasionally aggressive and warlike loa, and are associated with Haiti and the New World. They include Ezili Dantor, Marinette, and Met Kalfu (Maitre Carrefour, \"Master Crossroads\"). Their traditional colour is red.\n\nKongo loa\n\nOriginating from the Congo region, these loa include the many Simbi loa. It also includes Marinette, a fierce and much feared female loa.\n\nNago loa\n\nOriginating from Yorubaland, this nation includes many of the Ogoun loa.\n\nGhede loa\n\nThe Ghede are the spirits of the dead. They are traditionally led by the Barons (La Croix, Samedi, Cimitière, Kriminel), and Maman Brigitte. The Ghede as a family are loud, rude (although rarely to the point of real insult), sexual, and usually a lot of fun. As those who have lived already, they have nothing to fear, and frequently will display how far past consequence and feeling they are when they come through in a service—eating glass, raw chillis, and anointing their sensitive areas with chilli rum, for example. Their traditional colours are black and purple.\n\nVarious loas",
