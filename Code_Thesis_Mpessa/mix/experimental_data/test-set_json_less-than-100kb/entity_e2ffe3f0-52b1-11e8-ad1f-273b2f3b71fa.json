  "textBody" : "In number theory, a Carmichael number is a composite number n which satisfies the modular arithmetic congruence relation:\nb^{n-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{n}\nfor all integers b which are relatively prime to n.\n\nThey are named for Robert Carmichael.\nThe Carmichael numbers are the subset K1 of the Knödel numbers.\n\nEquivalently, a Carmichael number is a composite number n for which\nb^n\\equiv b\\pmod{n}\nfor all integers b.\n\nOverview\n\nFermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer b, the number b p − b is an integer multiple of p.  Carmichael numbers are composite numbers which have this property.  Carmichael numbers are also called Fermat pseudoprimes or absolute Fermat pseudoprimes. A Carmichael number will pass a Fermat primality test to every base b relatively prime to the number, even though it is not actually prime.\nThis makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem less effective than strong probable prime tests such as the Baillie-PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test.\n\nHowever, no Carmichael number is either an Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime or a strong pseudoprime to every base relatively prime to it\n Lehmer proved that no Carmichael number is an Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime to every base relatively prime to it. He used the term strong pseudoprime, but the terminology has changed since then. Strong pseudoprimes are a subset of Euler-Jacobi pseudoprimes. Therefore, no Carmichael number is a strong pseudoprime to every base relatively prime to it.\nso, in theory, either an Euler or a strong probable prime test could prove that a Carmichael number is, in fact, composite.\n\nAs numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become increasingly rare. For example, there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 1021 (approximately one in 50 trillion (5·1013) numbers).\n\nKorselt's criterion\n\nAn alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by Korselt's criterion.\n\nTheorem (A. Korselt 1899): A positive composite integer n is a Carmichael number if and only if n is square-free, and for all prime divisors p of n, it is true that p - 1 \\mid n - 1.\n\nIt follows from this theorem that all Carmichael numbers are odd, since any even composite number that is square-free (and hence has only one prime factor of two) will have at least one odd prime factor, and thus p - 1  \\mid n - 1 results in an even dividing an odd, a contradiction. (The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that -1 is a Fermat witness for any even composite number.)\nFrom the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are cyclic.[http://www.numericana.com/data/crump.htm Carmichael Multiples of Odd Cyclic Numbers] \"Any divisor of a Carmichael number must be an odd cyclic number\"Proof sketch: If n is square-free but not cyclic, p_i \\mid p_j - 1 for two prime factors p_i and p_j of n. But if n satisfies Korselt then p_j - 1  \\mid n - 1, so by transitivity of the \"divides\" relation p_i  \\mid n - 1. But p_i is also a factor of n, a contradiction. Additionally, it follows that there are no Carmichael numbers with exactly two prime factors.\n\nDiscovery\n\nKorselt was the first who observed the basic properties of Carmichael numbers, but he did not give any examples. In 1910, Carmichael found the first and smallest such number, 561, which explains the name \"Carmichael number\".\n\nThat 561 is a Carmichael number can be seen with Korselt's criterion. Indeed, 561 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17 is square-free and 2 \\mid 560, 10 \\mid 560 and 16 \\mid 560.\n\nThe next six Carmichael numbers are :\n1105 = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\qquad (4 \\mid 1104;\\quad 12 \\mid 1104;\\quad 16 \\mid 1104)\n1729 = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\qquad (6 \\mid 1728;\\quad 12 \\mid 1728;\\quad 18 \\mid 1728)\n2465 = 5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 29 \\qquad (4 \\mid 2464;\\quad 16 \\mid 2464;\\quad 28 \\mid 2464)\n2821 = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 31 \\qquad (6 \\mid 2820;\\quad 12 \\mid 2820;\\quad 30 \\mid 2820)\n6601 = 7 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 41 \\qquad (6 \\mid 6600;\\quad 22 \\mid 6600;\\quad 40 \\mid 6600)\n8911 = 7 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 67 \\qquad (6 \\mid 8910;\\quad 18 \\mid 8910;\\quad 66 \\mid 8910).\n\nThese first seven Carmichael numbers, from 561 to 8911, were all found by the Czech mathematician Václav Šimerka in 1885 (thus preceding not just Carmichael but also Korselt, although Šimerka did not find anything like Korselt's criterion). His work, however, remained unnoticed.\n\nJ. Chernick proved a theorem in 1939 which can be used to construct a subset of Carmichael numbers. The number (6k + 1)(12k + 1)(18k + 1) is a Carmichael number if its three factors are all prime. Whether this formula produces an infinite quantity of Carmichael numbers is an open question (though it is implied by Dickson's conjecture).\n\nPaul Erdős heuristically argued there should be infinitely many Carmichael numbers. In 1994 it was shown by W. R. (Red) Alford, Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance that there really do exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers. Specifically, they showed that for sufficiently large n, there are at least n^{2/7} Carmichael numbers between 1 and n.\n\nLöh and Niebuhr in 1992 found some very large Carmichael numbers, including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits.\n\nProperties\n\nFactorizations \n\nCarmichael numbers have at least three positive prime factors. For some fixed R, there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers with exactly R factors; in fact, there are infinitely many such R.\n\nThe first Carmichael numbers with k = 3, 4, 5, \\ldots prime factors are :\n\nThe first Carmichael numbers with 4 prime factors are :\n\nThe second Carmichael number (1105) can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number. The third Carmichael number (1729) is the Hardy-Ramanujan Number: the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes (of positive numbers) in two different ways.\n\nDistribution\n\nLet C(X) denote the number of Carmichael numbers less than or equal to X. The distribution of Carmichael numbers by powers of 10 :\n\nIn 1953, Knödel proved the upper bound:\nC(X) \n\nfor some constant k_1.\n\nIn 1956, Erdős improved the bound to\n\nC(X) \n\nfor some constant k_2. He further gave a heuristic argument suggesting that this upper bound should be close to the true growth rate of C(X). The table below gives approximate minimal values for the constant k in the Erdős bound for X=10^n as n grows:\n\nIn the other direction, Alford, Granville and Pomerance proved in 1994 that for sufficiently large X,\nC(X) > X^\\frac{2}{7}.\n\nIn 2005, this bound was further improved by Harman to\nC(X) > X^{0.332}\n\nwho subsequently improved the exponent to 0.7039 \\cdot 0.4736 = 0.33336704 > 1/3 .\n\nRegarding the asymptotic distribution of Carmichael numbers, there have been several conjectures. In 1956, Erdős conjectured that there were X^{1-o(1)} Carmichael numbers for X sufficiently large. In 1981, Pomerance sharpened Erdős' heuristic arguments to conjecture that there are\n\nX^{1-{\\frac{\\{1+o(1)\\}\\log\\log\\log X}{\\log\\log X}}}\n\nCarmichael numbers up to X. However, inside current computational ranges (such as the counts of Carmichael numbers performed by Pinch up to 1021), these conjectures are not yet borne out by the data.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nThe notion of Carmichael number generalizes to a Carmichael ideal in any number field K.
