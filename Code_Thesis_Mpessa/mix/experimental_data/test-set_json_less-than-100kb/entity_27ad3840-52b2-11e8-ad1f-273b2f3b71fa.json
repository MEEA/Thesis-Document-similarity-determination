  "textBody" : "The Demographics of Kyrgyzstan is about the demographic features of the population of Kyrgyzstan, including population growth, population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. The name Kyrgyz, both for the people and the country, means \"forty girls\" or \"forty tribes\", a reference to the epic hero Manas who unified forty tribes against the Oirats, as symbolized by the 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nDemographic trends\n\nKyrgyzstan's population increased from 2.1 million to 4.8 million between the censuses of 1959 and 1999. Official estimates set the population at 5.2 million in 2007. Of those, 34.4% are under the age of 15 and 6.2% are over the age of 65. The country is rural: only about one-third of Kyrgyzstan's population live in urban areas. The average population density is 69 people per square mile (29 people per km²).\n\nThe nation's largest ethnic group are the Kyrgyz, a Turkic people, which comprise 70.9% of the population (2009 census). Other ethnic groups include Russians (9.0%) concentrated in the north and Uzbeks (14.5%) living in the south. Small but noticeable minorities include Dungans (1.9%), Uyghurs (1.1%), Tajiks (1.1%), Kazakhs (0.7%) and Ukrainians (0.5%), and other smaller ethnic minorities (1.7%). Of the formerly sizable Volga German community, exiled here by Joseph Stalin from their earlier homes in the Volga German Republic, most have returned to Germany, and only a few small groups remain. A small percentage of the population are also Koreans, who are the descendants of the Koreans deported in 1937 from the Soviet Far East to Central Asia.\n\nKyrgyzstan has undergone a pronounced change in its ethnic composition since independence. The percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz increased from around 50% in 1979 to nearly 70% in 2007, while the percentage of European ethnic groups (Russians, Ukrainians and Germans) dropped from 35% to about 10%.\n\nThe Kyrgyz have historically been semi-nomadic herders, living in round tents called yurts and tending sheep, horses and yaks. This nomadic tradition continues to function seasonally (see transhumance) as herding families return to the high mountain pasture (or jailoo) in the summer. The retention of this nomadic heritage and the freedoms that it implies continue to affect the political atmosphere in the country.\n\nVital statistics\n\nBirths and deaths\n\nStatistics are taken from the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Demographic Annual of the Kyrgyz Republic, and Demoskop Weekly.\n\nLive born children:\n\n1st half of 2016: 77 488\n\n1st half of 2017: 77 109\n\nDead:\n\n1st half of 2016: 16 751\n\n1st half of 2017: 18 033\n\nNatural increase:\n\n1st half of 2016: 60 737\n\n1st half of 2017: 59 076\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.65 children born/woman (2009 est.)\n\nThe differences in the number of children by nationality are significant: Uzbeks (3.0 children), Tajiks (3.0 children), Turks (2.9), Kyrgyz (2.9), Dungans (2.8) Russians (1.7), Koreans (1.7), Germans (1.8), Ukrainians (2.1), Tatars (2.1), Kazakhs (2.3) and Ugyhurs (2.5). The TFR for Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, and Koreans in Kyrgyzstan are considerably higher than in their home countries, possibly due to the much lower cost of living.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nAccording to the 1999 census,[http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/census.pdf Population census for Kyrgyzstan, 1999]  the ethnic composition of the population was as follows: Kyrgyz 72.6%, Uzbeks 14.4%, Russians 6.4%, Dungans 1.1%, Uyghurs 0,9%, other 3.6%, including Koreans 0.4% and Germans 0.4% (among them Low German-speaking Mennonites). Most Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Germans, and Koreans lived in northeast, especially around the city of Karakol. Most of the Dungans and Ugyhurs are found along the Chinese border. Most of the Tajiks and Uzbeks live in the south. The emigration of non-Turkic people to Russia, Ukraine, and Germany is now negligible, in part because most of them left prior to 1999. For example, the number of Germans has fallen by over 90% between the 1989 and 2009 censuses.\n\nThe table shows the ethnic composition of Kyrgyzstan's population according to all population censuses between 1926 and 2009. There has been a sharp decline in the European ethnic groups (Russians, Ukrainians, Germans) and also Tatars since independence (as captured in the 1989, 1999 and 2009 censuses).\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nData from CIA World Factbook unless otherwise indicated.\n\nEthnic groups\n\n*Kyrgyz 70.9%\n* Uzbek 14.3%\n* Russian 7.7%\n* Dungan 1.1%\n* Other 5.9% (includes Uyghur, Tajik, Turk, Kazakh, Tatar,  Ukrainian, Korean, German) (2009 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\n*Kyrgyz (official) 71.4%\n*Uzbek 14.4%\n* Russian (official) 9%\n*Other 5.2% (2009 est.)\n\nReligions\n\n*Islam 75%\n*Russian Orthodox 20%\n*Other 5%.\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth:\n1.05 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years:\n1.04 male(s)/female\n15–64 years:\n0.96 male(s)/female\n65 years and over:\n0.64 male(s)/female\ntotal population:\n0.96 male(s)/fe\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\nTotal 31.26 deaths/1,000 live births\nMale 36.19 deaths/1,000 live births\nFemale 26.06 deaths/1,000 live births (2009 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population:\n69.43 years\nmale:\n65.43 years...\nfemale:\n73.64 years (2009 est.)\n\nNationality\n\nnoun:\nKyrgyzstani(s)\nadjective:\nKyrgyzstani\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition:\nage 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population:\n98.7%\nmale:\n99.3%\nfemale:\n98.1% (1999 census)",
