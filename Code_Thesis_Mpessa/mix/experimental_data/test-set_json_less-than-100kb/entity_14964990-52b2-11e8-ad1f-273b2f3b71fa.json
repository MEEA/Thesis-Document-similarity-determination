  "textBody" : "Hoosier Hysteria is the state of excitement surrounding basketball in Indiana, or more specifically the Indiana high school basketball tournament. In part, the excitement stemmed from the inclusion of all tournament entrants into the same tournament, where a small town's David might knock off a large city's Goliath. The most famous example occurred in 1954, when Milan (enrollment 161) defeated Muncie Central (enrollment over 1,600) to win the State title. The plot of the now famous movie, Hoosiers, was based on the story of the 1954 Milan team and seems to typify the hysteria related to basketball in the state of Indiana.\n\nIndiana's passion for basketball was observed and written about by basketball's inventor, James Naismith. In 1925, Naismith visited an Indiana basketball state finals game along with 15,000 screaming fans and later wrote, that while it was invented in Massachusetts, \"basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport.\" Hoosiers have a traditional love for basketball similar to that of Texans or Ohioans for football, Pennsylvanians for wrestling, and Minnesotans for ice hockey.\n\nHigh school basketball \n\nHomegrown talent\n\nIndiana high schools boast a tradition of producing top caliber basketball players.  Through the 2009-2010 NBA season, 152 Hoosier athletes have played professional basketball in the world's top league.  Considering the size of the state (population 6.4 million), this makes Indiana high schools by far the most successful at developing NBA players per capita.  Today there are 22 Hoosiers in the NBA - more than one for every 150,000 male residents. The state's unparalleled ability to produce NBA talent, both statewide and specifically in smaller towns, is featured in this [http://deadspin.com/infographics-where-do-pro-basketball-players-come-from-513261549 Deadspin article]. In 2017, Indiana natives won the NBA and D-league Dunk Contests, NBA and D-league 3-pont contests, and won runner-up in the NBA Skills Challenge.\n\nOne-class tradition\n\nHistorically, each of the several hundred small towns of Indiana had its own small school system. Before consolidation of many of these rural school districts in the last half of the twentieth century, Indiana high schools had fewer students than those of most other states; basketball was a natural game for these schools since it only required five starters and a few reserves. Even one or two great basketball players could make a high school team a powerhouse, and nearly every Indiana town dreamt of such glory.\n\nThe Franklin Wonder Five was the first team to win the state championship in three consecutive years, from 1920-1922.  This accomplishment would not be matched for over six decades.  The team was led by Fuzzy Vandivier.\n\nAfter Milan's Miracle in the 1950s, no school with an enrollment of less than 500 won another boys' State title under the all-comers format. As school consolidation became more common and as more rural residents migrated to cities making large high schools grow even larger, smaller high schools had only a mismatch to look forward to come tournament time, as success concentrated in Indiana's large urban and suburban schools. Starting with the 1997-1998 season, Indiana established a controversial four-class system for its basketball championship, although many other sports remain single-class. The state's move to this new system has, to some extent, diminished the phenomenon and public opinion is widely split on the merits of \"class basketball.\"\n\nAside from the \"Milan Miracle,\" the story of Crispus Attucks High School ranks as one of the greatest in Indiana high school basketball tradition. In 1955, the year after Attucks had lost in the semistate final (state quarterfinals) to Milan's championship team, Attucks gained fame by winning the Indiana state championship, becoming the first all-black school in the nation to win a state title open to all schools regardless of race. Crispus Attucks repeated as champions in 1956, becoming the first Indiana high school team to complete a season undefeated. The Attucks teams of 1954 through 1956 were led by Oscar Robertson. Both stories, Milan and Crispus Attucks, are memorialized for their accomplishments and tradition at the Indiana State Museum as well as at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in New Castle, Indiana.\n\nA highlight of the single-class tournament was the 1990 State Championship game, in which the paid attendance was over 40,000 fans.  This phenomenal turnout of fans who witnessed Damon Bailey's Bedford-North Lawrence Stars win the State Championship stands as the largest crowd ever to witness a high school basketball game.\n\nAfter the 1997 season (when Bloomington North won the final single-class State Championship), the IHSAA controversially did away with the single-class system, ending the run of single-class champions in Indiana.  There are many in Indiana who lament this loss, and who know that Hoosier Hysteria has been dramatically and significantly lessened thereby. Hoosier Hysteria has not completely diminished however. For example, in 2003, DeKalb High School (1200 students) nearly defeated Pike High School (3000) students).  Also, the Indiana tournament is still the most attended in the nation, with final four games for the two larger divisions regularly selling out Bankers Life Fieldhouse (formerly Conseco Fieldhouse).\n\nHigh school gymnasiums\n\nPerhaps one of the more telling signs of the passion and commitment to basketball at the high school level is the number and size of large basketball gymnasiums in the state. With considerable cost and effort, Indiana boasts nine of the ten largest high school gyms in the country, and a purported eighteen of the top twenty. Seventeen venues in Indiana today boast a capacity of over 6,000, the largest being the New Castle Fieldhouse, seating 9,325.\n\nCollege basketball\n\nHoosier Hysteria may have its roots firmly planted in the high school game, but the college tradition brings its own depth to Indiana's passion. In NCAA Division I basketball, Indiana's colleges and universities have a storied past. Big Ten rivals Purdue University and Indiana University are the most notable, with national and conference championships to boast. Smaller schools such as the University of Notre Dame, Indiana State University, Ball State University, Butler University, the University of Evansville, IUPUI, IPFW, and Valparaiso University add to the mix. Vincennes University boasts an outstanding national tradition in the junior college ranks.  And in Division II St. Joseph's, University of Indianapolis and University of Southern Indiana have added their own successes to the legend of Indiana basketball. Wabash College won the Men's Division III NCAA Championship in 1982 and their 1905 24-0 team was considered World Champions; DePauw University and Manchester College were Div III National Finalists. It is safe to say that the terms \"Final Four\" and \"March Madness\" have grown out of the tradition of Hoosier Hysteria.\n\nBall State Cardinals\n\nThe Ball State Cardinals have won several conference championships and earned a number of NCAA Tournament berths over the years, including:\n*Seven Mid-American Conference Season Championships\n*Seven Mid-American Conference (MAC) Tournament Championships (and subsequent NCAA Tournament appearances)\n*Bonzi Wells, a Muncie, Indiana native, was a four-year letterwinner at Ball State, finishing his career as the Mid-American Conference's all-time leading scorer, and leading the NCAA in steals.\n*Ball State's highest finish in the NCAA Tournament came in 1990, when they defeated Gary Payton's Oregon State Beavers and Coach Denny Crum's Louisville Cardinals before falling to eventual champion UNLV by 2, 69-67.\n\nButler Bulldogs\n\n* Home of the legendary Hinkle Fieldhouse, the largest basketball arena in the world from 1928-1950 (including professional arenas).  Hinkle hosted the Indiana High School Athletic Association Championships for many years (including Milan's 1954 championship), Butler University also is notable for its men's and women's basketball teams. The Bulldogs advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament in the 2003 and 2007 seasons.\n* In 2006, the Bulldogs won the 2006 Preseason NIT, beating most notably Indiana and Notre Dame to reach the semifinals in New York City. Behind a strong performance from guard A.J. Graves, the Bulldogs defeated Tennessee and Gonzaga at Madison Square Garden.\n* In 2010, Butler reached their first Final Four as a #5 seed, beating #12 seeded UTEP in the first round behind a flurry of 3-pointers, edging out a very good #13 seed Murray State (who upset #4 seed Vanderbilt in the first round), and then in the Sweet 16, Butler upset #1 seed Syracuse, and in a thrilling Elite Eight game Butler upset #2 seed Kansas State. The Bulldogs made it to the Finals of the NCAA Tournament after defeating #5 seed Michigan State from the Midwest division. The Bulldogs played against #1 seeded Duke from the South in the finals but lost in a close game, with a potential game-winning shot by Gordon Hayward from just inside half-court rimming out.\n* In 2011, Butler returned to the NCAA title game for a second straight year. However, Butler lost 53-41 to Connecticut, shooting a historically low 18.8 percent from the field — the worst in any NCAA title game and the worst in any NCAA tourney game since Harvard against Ohio State in 1946.\n\nEvansville Purple Aces\n\n*The Evansville Purple Aces have won five national championships in the NCAA College Division (now known as Division II): 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965 (29-0 record), and 1971. This ranks second all-time.\n*After joining the NCAA's Division I in 1977, Evansville was a charter member of the Midwest Collegiate Conference, now known as the Horizon League. The Aces won or shared the MCC regular season title in 1982, 1987, 1989, 1992, and 1993. They also won the conference tournament title in 1982, 1992, and 1993.\n*The Aces are now a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, and won the 1999 regular season title.\n*Legendary Aces coach Arad McCutchan was the first NCAA College Division coach selected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n\nIndiana's collegiate basketball squad, the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team has several championships to their credit:\n\n*Five NCAA National Championships (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987), placing them in a tie for fourth most all-time\n*One NIT Championship (1979) over rival Purdue; and one Runner-up finish (1985) to a UCLA team featuring future member of the Indiana Pacers, Reggie Miller\n*Twenty-two Big Ten Championships (including four-in-a-row, from 1973 to 1976), currently one behind rival Purdue for the most all-time\n*Also, Indiana completed the most recent undefeated season in Division I men's college basketball, going 32-0 in the 1975-76 season under Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight.\n\nThe Hoosiers' five NCAA Championships are the fourth in history, tied with Duke, and trailing UCLA (11) Kentucky (8) and North Carolina (6). Their eight trips to the Final Four ranks seventh on the all-time list. The Hoosiers have made 32 appearances in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament (fifth-most in NCAA history). In those 32 appearances, Indiana has posted 52 victories, the sixth-most in NCAA history.\n\nIndiana State Sycamores\n\n*Led by the legendary French Lick standout Larry Bird, Indiana State was the runner-up in the 1979 NCAA Tournament. They lost to Magic Johnson's Michigan State Spartans.  Their final record was 33-1.\n*Indiana State, led by All-American Jerry Newsom, was the 1968 NCAA College Division Runner-up.  They lost to perennial power Kentucky Wesleyan. Their final record was 23-8.\n*Indiana State won the 1950 NAIA Championship.\n**Eight players from the 1950 team played for Head Coach John Longfellow as the United States' Gold Medal Basketball team at the inaugural 1951 Pan-American Games.\n*Indiana State was the runner-up in the 1946 and 1948 NAIA championship games.  The 1948 team was coached by the legendary John Wooden; it is the only Championship game loss in Coach Wooden's career.\n**In 1947, Wooden's basketball team won the conference title and received an invitation to the NAIA National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation citing the NAIA's policy banning African American players. A member on the Indiana State Sycamores' team was Clarence Walker, an African-American athlete from East Chicago, Indiana. In 1948 the NAIA changed this policy and Wooden guided his team to the NAIA final, losing to Louisville. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in ANY post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.\n**Indiana State finished third in 1953 NAIA tourney and fourth in the 1949 NAIA tourney\n* In 1936, Indiana State was the runner-up in the U.S. Olympics Trials for basketball.\n* Two MVC Regular Season Championships and three MVC Tournament Championships.\n* Four Indiana Collegiate Conference (ICC) Regular Season Championships.\n* Four Indiana Intercollegiate Conference (IIC) Regular Season Championships\n\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish\n\n* The Notre Dame Men's Basketball team was crowned National Champions of the 1926-1927 basketball season as well as the 1935-1936 basketball season by the Helms Athletic Foundation.\n* The Notre Dame Men have a history of upsetting number 1 ranked teams as they have beaten 12 teams ranked #1 in the polls. The most notable of these upsets was the 1974 upset of UCLA, who had won their previous 88 contests. \n* The Notre Dame Men's Basketball team currently has the 9th most wins in College Basketball History. \n* Led by Coach Digger Phelps, the Irish made a trip to the 1978 Final Four where they lost to the Duke Blue Devils.\n* The Irish have appeared in the Elite 8 on 5 different occasions.

Three of those players were named to the team in 3 different years. (Only 18 players have been named as consensus All-Americans three times.)\n* Notre Dame all-time leading scorer Austin Carr currently holds the record for the most points in an NCAA tournament game, scoring 61 against Ohio in 1971. \n* The Irish women won the National Championship in 2001.\n* The Irish women were also National Champion runner-ups in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, as they went to five consecutive Final Fours from 2011 through 2015.\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nWith their only men's national championship coming in the days before the NCAA Tournament, the Purdue Boilermakers have a basketball history:\n*National championship in 1932, led by three-time All-American player and Indiana native John Wooden.

The city will host the men's Final Four next in 2021. Previous events were held in the Market Square Arena or the RCA Dome, but given the new stadium built for the Indianapolis Colts, Lucas Oil Stadium began hosting Final Four events in 2010. When the NCAA Headquarters relocated to Indianapolis, it was stated that Indianapolis would then host the men's Final Four once every five years.
