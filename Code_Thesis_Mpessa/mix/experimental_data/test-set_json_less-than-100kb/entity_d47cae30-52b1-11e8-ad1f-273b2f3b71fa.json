  "textBody" : "Chervil (; Anthriscus cerefolium), sometimes called French parsley or garden chervil (to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil), is a delicate annual herb related to parsley. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture fines herbes.\n\nBiology\n\nA member of the Apiaceae, chervil is native to the Caucasus but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.\n\nThe plants grow to 40 -, with tripinnate leaves that may be curly. The small white flowers form small umbels,  across. The fruit is about 1 cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak.\n\nUses and impact\n\nCulinary arts\n\nChervil is used, particularly in France, to season poultry, seafood, young spring vegetables (such as carrots), soups, and sauces. More delicate than parsley, it has a faint taste of liquorice or aniseed.\n\nChervil is one of the four traditional French fines herbes, along with tarragon, chives, and parsley, which are essential to French cooking.Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking vol. I p 18. Unlike the more pungent, robust herbs, thyme, rosemary, etc., which can take prolonged cooking, the fines herbes are added at the last minute, to salads, omelettes, and soups.\n\nHorticulture\n\nAccording to some, slugs are attracted to chervil and the plant is sometimes used to bait them.[https://books.google.com/books?idGcWQQKJX1xEC&pg\nPA375&dqThe+Organic+Gardener%27s+Handbook+of+Natural+Pest+and+Disease&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwig4J2EppDRAhVS1iYKHSryCw4Q6AEIKDAC#vonepage&q&f\nfalse Fern Marshall Bradley, Barbara W.

It was claimed to be useful as a digestive aid, for lowering high blood pressure, and, infused with vinegar, for curing hiccups.

Other plants in the family Apiaceae can have similar effects.\n\nCultivation\n\nTransplanting chervil can be difficult, due to the long taproot. It prefers a cool and moist location; otherwise, it rapidly goes to seed (also known as bolting). It is usually grown as a cool-season crop, like lettuce, and should be planted in early spring and late fall or in a winter greenhouse. Regular harvesting of leaves also helps to prevent bolting. If plants bolt despite precautions, the plant can be periodically re-sown throughout the growing season, thus producing fresh plants as older plants bolt and go out of production.\n\nChervil grows to a height of 12 to, and a width of 6 to.",
