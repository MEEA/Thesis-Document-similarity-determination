In 1957, Chrysler, Curtiss-Wright, and Piasecki were assigned contracts for building and delivery of prototypes. They all delivered their prototypes; however, Piasecki's VZ-8 was the most successful of the three. While it would normally operate close to the ground, it was capable of flying to several thousand feet, proving to be stable in flight.

However, to date, no vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle has ever demonstrated such capabilities. To produce such an aircraft would require a propulsion system that is quiet, to avoid noise complaints, and has non-exposed rotors so it could be flown safely in urban environments. Additionally, for such aircraft to become airborne, they would require very powerful engines which would create huge and concentrated downdrafts, a bad idea in an urban environment. Many types of aircraft technologies and form factors have been suggested, such as ducted-fan and tiltrotor vehicles, but most previous designs have suffered from problems; ducted-fan aircraft tend to easily lose stability and have difficulty traveling greater than 30–40 knots, while tiltrotors, such as the V-22 Osprey, are generally noisy.\n\nEconomics\n\nDue to the requirement of propulsion that is both small and powerful, the cost of producing a flying car would be very high and estimated by some as much as 10 million dollars. In addition, the flying car's energy efficiency would be much lower compared to conventional cars and other aircraft; optimal fuel efficiency for airplanes is at high speeds and high altitudes,Barney L. Capehart (2007). Encyclopedia of Energy Engineering and Technology, Volume 1. CRC Press. , . while flying cars would be used for shorter distances, at higher frequency, lower speeds and lower altitude. For both environmental and economic reasons, flying cars would be an enormous use of resources.\n\nSafety\n\nAlthough statistically, commercial flying is much safer than driving, unlike commercial planes personal flying cars might not have as many safety checks and their pilots would not be as well trained. Humans already have problems with the aspect of driving in two dimensions (forward and backwards, side to side), adding in the up and down aspect would make \"driving\" or flying as it would be, much more difficult; however, this problem might be solved via the sole use of self-flying and self-driving cars. In mid-air collisions and mechanical failures, the aircraft could fall from the sky or go through an emergency landing, resulting in deaths and property damage. In addition, poor weather conditions, such as low air density, lightning storms and heavy rain, snow or fog could be challenging and affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.\n\nPopular culture\n\nWhere's my flying car?\n\nThe flying car was and remains a common feature of conceptions of the future, including imagined near futures such as those of the 21st century. Complaints of the non-existence of flying cars have become nearly idiomatic as expressions of disappointment in the failure of the present to measure up to the glory of past predictions.\n\nIn 1999 the U.S. journalist Gail Collins noted:\n\nAs a result, flying cars have been referred to jokingly with the question \"Where's my flying car?\", emblematic of the supposed failure of modern technology to match futuristic visions that were promoted in earlier decades.\n\nAired on 8 January 1998, Seinfelds 167th episode, \"The Dealership\", featured George and Jerry complaining about the non-existence of the flying cars. Jerry says, \"It's like we're living in the '50s here.\"\n\nA 2001 IBM television commercial featured Avery Brooks complaining, \"It is the year 2000, but where are the flying cars? I was promised flying cars. I don’t see any flying cars. Why? Why? Why?\"\n\nComedian Lewis Black had a similar routine early in the decade, in which he says, \"This new millennium sucks! It's exactly the same as the old millennium! You know why? No flying cars!\"\n\nThe Flying Car was a comedy short film written by Kevin Smith in 2002 for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It featured Dante Hicks and Randal Graves stuck in traffic, discussing the lengths to which a man might go to obtain such a vehicle.\n\nIn 2008, Onion News Networks 245th episode, titled \"Mean Automakers Dash Nation's Hope for Flying Cars\", featured The Onion's anchor Brandon Armstrong humorously arguing about the feasibility and existence of flying cars with representatives from General Motors, Toyota and Ford.\n\nFiction\n\nThe flying car has been depicted in many works of fantasy and science fiction.\n\nLive action films \n\n* Fantômas se déchaîne (1965) - Fantômas escapes in style, using his Citroën DS with retractable wings that converts into an airplane\n*Star Wars (1977–present)\n*:Flying cars appear in Star Wars where they are called airspeeders, such as those that can be seen on the planet of Coruscant in all three Star Wars prequel movies, from 1999's Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace onward. They are also featured in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, where an early chase sequence involves flying cars. In 2005's Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, Bail Organa rides a retro-futuristic vehicle that apart from its flying ability resembles a 1950-style car.\n*Blade Runner (1982)\n*:\"Spinner\" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in Blade Runner, set in futuristic-cyberpunk Los Angeles of 2019. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using jet propulsion much like Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.Sammon, pp. 79–80 The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an \"aerodyne\"—a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: \"conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity\" Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield. A Spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.\n*Back to the Future and Back to the Future Part II (1985/1989)\n*:In Back to the Future Part II and the ending of Back to the Future, Doc Brown invites Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer in his modified flying DeLorean time machine, and time travels to the year 2015 where flying hovercars are a common sight.\n*The Fifth Element (1997)\n*:\n*:In The Fifth Element, set in 2263 New York City, flying cars are used as main mean of transportation. The production design for the film was developed by French comics creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières. Mézières wrote the book The Circles of Power, which features a character named S'Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air traffic of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Besson read the book and was inspired to change the Dallas character to a taxicab driver who flies through a futuristic New York City.\n* Chitty Chitty Bang Bang: Professor Caractacus Potts salvages a broken classic race car and converts it into a flying car with wings sporting external propellers.\n* The Absent Minded Professor: Professor Ned Brainard (Fred MacMurray) makes a Model T fly using flubber.

Later on in the episode \"The Wheels of fate\" a flying red car named Lighting Cruiser is a vehicle that Divatox tried to capture but T.J. captured the car. The Lighting Cruiser has auto driving and can go from wheel mode to flight mode by turning 4 wheels up allowing it to fly and it can fly like a jet. It would be used by T.J. along with Storm Blaster car which was used by Justin Stewart.\n* Buck Rogers (serial) In the 1939 black and white live action TV series, after Buck Rogers and Buddy Wade wake up from their deep sleep, they discover a future with flying cars.\n* Marvel's Agents of Shield Characters belonging to the secret spy agency routinely use flying cars designed to look like normal vehicles.\n\nAnimation\n\n*The Animatrix (2003)\n*:In the best-sellingMcCarthy, Helen. 500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide. — Harper Design, 2009. — P. 40. — 528 p. —  animated film The Animatrix (part of The Matrix saga), specifically in the episode called The Second Renaissance, appears a supposed TV commercial announcing a flying car called Versatran, this episode details the backstory of the Matrix universe, and the original war between man and machines which led to the creation of the Matrix; among its content shows the elaboration of the Versatran propulsion engines, and how those engines will latter be used in Hovercraft battleships like the Nebuchadnezzar (the ship Morpheus and Trinity use to rescue Neo).\n* The animated television series The Jetsons, premiered in 1962, reflected the idea that flying cars would become a significant means of transportation in the future.

To produce such an aircraft would require a propulsion system that is quiet, to avoid noise complaints, and has non-exposed rotors so it could be flown safely in urban environments. Additionally, for such aircraft to become airborne, they would require very powerful engines which would create huge and concentrated downdrafts, a bad idea in an urban environment. Many types of aircraft technologies and form factors have been suggested, such as ducted-fan and tiltrotor vehicles, but most previous designs have suffered from problems; ducted-fan aircraft tend to easily lose stability and have difficulty traveling greater than 30–40 knots, while tiltrotors, such as the V-22 Osprey, are generally noisy.\n\nEconomics\n\nDue to the requirement of propulsion that is both small and powerful, the cost of producing a flying car would be very high and estimated by some as much as 10 million dollars. In addition, the flying car's energy efficiency would be much lower compared to conventional cars and other aircraft; optimal fuel efficiency for airplanes is at high speeds and high altitudes,Barney L. Capehart (2007). Encyclopedia of Energy Engineering and Technology, Volume 1. CRC Press. , . while flying cars would be used for shorter distances, at higher frequency, lower speeds and lower altitude. For both environmental and economic reasons, flying cars would be an enormous use of resources.\n\nSafety\n\nAlthough statistically, commercial flying is much safer than driving, unlike commercial planes personal flying cars might not have as many safety checks and their pilots would not be as well trained. Humans already have problems with the aspect of driving in two dimensions (forward and backwards, side to side), adding in the up and down aspect would make \"driving\" or flying as it would be, much more difficult; however, this problem might be solved via the sole use of self-flying and self-driving cars. In mid-air collisions and mechanical failures, the aircraft could fall from the sky or go through an emergency landing, resulting in deaths and property damage. In addition, poor weather conditions, such as low air density, lightning storms and heavy rain, snow or fog could be challenging and affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.\n\nPopular culture\n\nWhere's my flying car?\n\nThe flying car was and remains a common feature of conceptions of the future, including imagined near futures such as those of the 21st century. Complaints of the non-existence of flying cars have become nearly idiomatic as expressions of disappointment in the failure of the present to measure up to the glory of past predictions.\n\nIn 1999 the U.S. journalist Gail Collins noted:\n\nAs a result, flying cars have been referred to jokingly with the question \"Where's my flying car?\", emblematic of the supposed failure of modern technology to match futuristic visions that were promoted in earlier decades.\n\nAired on 8 January 1998, Seinfelds 167th episode, \"The Dealership\", featured George and Jerry complaining about the non-existence of the flying cars. Jerry says, \"It's like we're living in the '50s here.\"\n\nA 2001 IBM television commercial featured Avery Brooks complaining, \"It is the year 2000, but where are the flying cars? I was promised flying cars. I don’t see any flying cars. Why? Why? Why?\"\n\nComedian Lewis Black had a similar routine early in the decade, in which he says, \"This new millennium sucks! It's exactly the same as the old millennium! You know why? No flying cars!\"\n\nThe Flying Car was a comedy short film written by Kevin Smith in 2002 for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It featured Dante Hicks and Randal Graves stuck in traffic, discussing the lengths to which a man might go to obtain such a vehicle.\n\nIn 2008, Onion News Networks 245th episode, titled \"Mean Automakers Dash Nation's Hope for Flying Cars\", featured The Onion's anchor Brandon Armstrong humorously arguing about the feasibility and existence of flying cars with representatives from General Motors, Toyota and Ford.\n\nFiction\n\nThe flying car has been depicted in many works of fantasy and science fiction.\n\nLive action films \n\n* Fantômas se déchaîne (1965) - Fantômas escapes in style, using his Citroën DS with retractable wings that converts into an airplane\n*Star Wars (1977–present)\n*:Flying cars appear in Star Wars where they are called airspeeders, such as those that can be seen on the planet of Coruscant in all three Star Wars prequel movies, from 1999's Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace onward. They are also featured in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, where an early chase sequence involves flying cars. In 2005's Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, Bail Organa rides a retro-futuristic vehicle that apart from its flying ability resembles a 1950-style car.\n*Blade Runner (1982)\n*:\"Spinner\" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in Blade Runner, set in futuristic-cyberpunk Los Angeles of 2019. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using jet propulsion much like Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.Sammon, pp. 79–80 The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an \"aerodyne\"—a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: \"conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity\" Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield. A Spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.\n*Back to the Future and Back to the Future Part II (1985/1989)\n*:In Back to the Future Part II and the ending of Back to the Future, Doc Brown invites Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer in his modified flying DeLorean time machine, and time travels to the year 2015 where flying hovercars are a common sight.\n*The Fifth Element (1997)\n*:\n*:In The Fifth Element, set in 2263 New York City, flying cars are used as main mean of transportation.
