  "textBody" : "Aragonese (; aragonés in Aragonese) is a Romance language spoken in several dialects by 10,000 to 30,000 people in the Pyrenees valleys of Aragon, Spain, primarily in the comarcas of Somontano de Barbastro, Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza/Ribagorça. It is the only modern language which survived from medieval Navarro-Aragonese in a form distinctly different from Spanish.\n\nInformally known as fabla (\"talk\" or \"speech\"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its local dialects such as cheso (from Valle de Hecho) or patués (from the Benasque Valley).\n\nHistory\n\nAragonese, which developed in portions of the Ebro basin, can be traced back to the High Middle Ages. It spread throughout the Pyrenees to areas where languages similar to Basque were previously spoken. The Kingdom of Aragon (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the Moors farther south in the Reconquista and spreading the Aragonese language.\n\nThe union of the Catalan counties and the Kingdom of Aragon which formed the 12th-century Crown of Aragon did not merge the languages of the two territories; Catalan continued to be spoken in the east and Navarro-Aragonese in the west, with boundaries blurred by dialectal continuity. The Aragonese Reconquista in the south ended with the cession of Murcia by James I of Aragon to the Kingdom of Castile as dowry for an Aragonese princess.\n\nThe best-known proponent of the Aragonese language was Johan Ferrandez d'Heredia, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in Aragonese and translated several works from Greek into Aragonese (the first in medieval Europe).\n\nThe spread of Castilian (Spanish), the Castilian origin of the Trastámara dynasty, and the similarity between Castilian and Aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian Ferdinand I of Aragon, also known as Ferdinand of Antequeraa.\n\nIn recent times, Aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 Spanish transition to democracy heralded literary works and studies of the language.\n\nModern Aragonese\n\nAragonese is the native language of the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the comarcas of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which Aragonese is spoken are Huesca, Graus, Monzón, Barbastro, Bielsa, Chistén, Fonz, Echo, Estadilla, Benasque, Campo, Sabiñánigo, Jaca, Plan, Ansó, Ayerbe, Broto, and El Grado.\n\nIt is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of Zaragoza, Huesca, Ejea de los Caballeros, or Teruel. According to recent polls, there are about 25,500 speakers(2011) [https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/60448] Report about Census of population 2011 of Aragonese Sociolinguistics Seminar and University of Zaragoza  including speakers living outside the native area. \n\nIn 2009, the Languages Act of Aragon recognized the \"native language, original and historic\" of Aragon. The language received several linguistic rights, including its use in public administration.[http://www.boa.aragon.es/cgi-bin/BOAE/BRSCGI?CMDVERDOC&BASE\nBOLE&PIECEBOLE&DOCR\n3&SECFIRMA&RNG\n200&SEPARADOR&&PUBL\n20091230  Languages Act of Aragon] Official Bulletin of Aragon\n\nDialects\n\n*Western dialect: Ansó, Valle de Hecho, Chasa, Berdún, Chaca\n*Central dialect: Panticosa, Biescas, Torla, Broto, Bielsa, Yebra, Aínsa-Sobrarbe\n*Eastern dialect: Benás, Plan, Bisagorri, Campo, Perarrúa, Graus, Estadilla\n*Southern dialect: Agüero, Ayerbe, Rasal, Bolea, Lierta, Uesca, Almudévar, Nozito, Labata, Alguezra, Angüés, Pertusa, Balbastro, Nabal\n\nPhonology \n\nTraits\n\nAragonese has many historical traits in common with Catalan.

It has a more uniform system of assigning letters to phonemes, with less regard for etymology; words traditionally written with  and  are uniformly written with  in the Uesca system.

The language in these texts has a mixture of Aragonese and Castilian traits, and they are among the last known written examples of the Aragonese formerly spoken in central and southern Aragon.[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/26/50/097vespertino.pdf Aragonese in Aljamiado literature]\n\nGrammar\n\nAragonese grammar is similar to that of other Iberian Romance languages, such as Spanish and Catalan.\n\nArticles \n\nThe definite article in Aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes, with definite articles in Old Aragonese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. The most-widespread articles in Aragonese are similar to those in Galician and Portuguese, since they lack the initial l:\n\nThe second (auxiliary) article, after a vowel, is used with an r (pronounced [ɾ]).\n\nLexicology\n\nNeighboring Romance languages have influenced Aragonese. Catalan and Occitan influenced Medieval Aragonese, and the Catalan influence continued under the Crown of Aragon in the Ribagorçan dialect. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the Pyrenees. French has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and English has introduced a number of new words into the language.\n\nGender\n\nWords that were part of the Latin second declension—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:\n\n* FILIU(M) > fillo (son)\n* SCIURU + OLU(M) > esquiruelo (squirrel)\n\nWords that were part of the Latin first declension are usually feminine:\n* FILIA(M) > filla (daughter).\n\nSome Latin neuter plural nouns joined the first declension as singular feminine nouns: \n* FOLIA > fuella (leaf).\n\nWords ending in -or are feminine:\n* a honor, a calor, a color, and (in Medieval Aragonese) la amor\n\nThe names of fruit trees usually end in -era (a suffix derived from Latin -ARIA) and are usually feminine:\n* a perera, a manzanera, a nuquera, a castanyera, a tellera / o tilero, a olivera, a ciresera, l'almendrera\n\nThe genders of river names vary:\n\n* Many ending in -a are feminine: a Cinca/a Cinga, a Cinqueta, a Garona, L'Arba, a Noguera, a Isuela, La Uecha, La Uerva, etc. The latter was known as río de la Uerba during the 16th century.\n* Many from the second and the third declension are masculine: L'Ebro, O Galligo, O Flumen, L'Alcanadre.\n\nPronouns\n\nUnlike most other Ibero-Romance varieties, Aragonese has partitive and locative clitic pronouns derived from the Latin inde and ibi: en/ne and bi/i/ie.\n\nSuch pronouns are present in most major non-Iberian Romance languages (Catalan en and hi, Occitan ne and i, French en and y, and Italian ne and ci/vi).\n\nEn/ne is used for:\n* Partitive objects: No n'he visto como aquello (\"I haven't seen anything like that\", literally 'Not (of it) I have seen like that').\n* Partitive subjects: En fa tanto de mal (\"It hurts so much\", literally '(of it) it causes so much of pain')\n* Ablatives, places from which movements originate: Se'n va ra memoria (\"Memory goes away\", literally '(away from [the mind]) memory goes')\n\nBi/i/ie is used for:\n* Locatives, where something takes place: N'ibi heba uno (\"There was one of them\"), literally '(Of them) there was one')\n* Allatives, places that movements go towards or end: Vés-be ('Go there (imperative)')\n\nLiterature\n\nAragonese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history Liber Regum,[https://books.google.com/books?ei\n60n0TuPMFtG5hAf4ysDHAQ&hles&id\nAJYbAAAAIAAJ&dqliteratura+en+aragon%C3%A9s&q\nLibre+dels+tres+reys+d%27orient#search_anchor I Curso sobre lengua y literatura en Aragón: (Edad Media)] Razón feita d'amor, Libre dels tres reys d'orient, and Vida de Santa María Egipcíaca date from this period,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nLwDJOAAACAAJ&dqLa+vida+de+Santa+Maria+egipciaca&hl\nes&saX&ei\nYEr0ToPVN8uXhQeX2sWfAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA La vida de Santa Maria Egipciaca: a fourteenth-century translation into Old Castilian from Latin of a work by Paul the Deacon] there is also an Aragonese version of the Chronicle of Morea, differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called  Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea.\n\nEarly modern period\n\nSince 1500, Spanish was the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.[https://books.google.com/books?idfSVKAAAAYAAJ&q\nhermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&dqhermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&hl\nes&saX&ei\nCEv0TrveDYyzhAfL4szDAQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg Alazet: revista de filología, Número 5]\nAragonese became a popular village language.[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/26/50/097vespertino.pdf El aragonés de la  literatura aljamiado-morisca] During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear. In a 1650 Huesca literary contest, Aragonese poems were submitted by Matías Pradas, Isabel de Rodas and \"Fileno, montañés\".\n\nContemporary literature\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries have seen a renaissance of Aragonese literature in several dialects. In 1844, Braulio Foz' novel Vida de Pedro Saputo was published in the Almudévar (southern) dialect. The 20th century featured Domingo Miral's costumbrist comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa's poetry, both in Hecho (western) Aragonese; Cleto Torrodellas' poetry and Tonón de Baldomera's popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero's costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela' novel A Lueca, historia d'una moceta d'o Semontano, also in the southern dialect.\n\nAragonese in Modern Education \n\nThe 1997 Aragonese Law of languages stipulated that Aragonese (and Catalan) speakers had a right to the teaching of and in their own language.Following this, Aragonese lessons started in schools in the academic year 1997/98.It was originally taught as an extra-curricular, non-evaluable voluntary subject in four schools.However, whilst legally schools can choose to use Aragonese as the language of instruction, as of the academic year 2013/14, there are no recorded instances of this option being taken in primary or secondary education.In fact, the only current scenario in which Aragonese is used as the language of instruction is in the university course of Aragonese Philology, which is optional, taught over the summer and still only given in Aragonese in some of the lectures.\n\nPre-School Education \n\nIn pre-school education, students, whose parents wish to be taught Aragonese, receive between thirty minutes to one hour of Aragonese lessons a week.In the 2014/15 academic year there were 262 students recorded in pre-school Aragonese lessons. \n\nPrimary School Education \n\nThe subject of Aragonese now has a fully developed curriculum in primary education in Aragon.Despite this there are only seven Aragonese teachers in the region across both pre-primary and primary education and none hold permanent positions, whilst only 320 primary education students received Aragonese lessons in the academic year 2013/14.",

The 20th century featured Domingo Miral's costumbrist comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa's poetry, both in Hecho (western) Aragonese; Cleto Torrodellas' poetry and Tonón de Baldomera's popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero's costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela' novel A Lueca, historia d'una moceta d'o Semontano, also in the southern dialect.\n\nAragonese in Modern Education \n\nThe 1997 Aragonese Law of languages stipulated that Aragonese (and Catalan) speakers had a right to the teaching of and in their own language.Following this, Aragonese lessons started in schools in the academic year 1997/98.It was originally taught as an extra-curricular, non-evaluable voluntary subject in four schools.However, whilst legally schools can choose to use Aragonese as the language of instruction, as of the academic year 2013/14, there are no recorded instances of this option being taken in primary or secondary education.In fact, the only current scenario in which Aragonese is used as the language of instruction is in the university course of Aragonese Philology, which is optional, taught over the summer and still only given in Aragonese in some of the lectures.\n\nPre-School Education \n\nIn pre-school education, students, whose parents wish to be taught Aragonese, receive between thirty minutes to one hour of Aragonese lessons a week.In the 2014/15 academic year there were 262 students recorded in pre-school Aragonese lessons. \n\nPrimary School Education \n\nThe subject of Aragonese now has a fully developed curriculum in primary education in Aragon.Despite this there are only seven Aragonese teachers in the region across both pre-primary and primary education and none hold permanent positions, whilst only 320 primary education students received Aragonese lessons in the academic year 2013/14.
