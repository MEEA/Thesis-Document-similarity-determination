The four largest groups - Mongo, Luba, Kongo (all Bantu), and the Mangbetu-Azande make up about 45% of the population. The country has also 60,000 White Congolese most of Belgian ancestry who remained after independence.\n\nBantu peoples (80%):\nLuba (18%), Mongo (17%), Kongo (12%)\nOthers: Ambala, Ambuun, Angba, Babindi, Baboma, Baholo, Balunda, Bangala, Bango, Batsamba, Bazombe, Bemba, Bembe, Bira, Bowa, Dikidiki, Dzing, Fuliru, Havu, Hema, Hima, Hunde, Hutu, Iboko, Kanioka, Kaonde, Kuba, Kumu, Kwango, Lengola, Lokele, Lupu, Lwalwa, Mbala, Mbole, Mbuza (Budja), Nande, Ngoli, Bangoli, Ngombe, Nkumu, Nyanga, Pende, Popoi, Poto, Sango, Shi, Songo, Sukus, Tabwa, Tchokwé, Téké, Tembo, Tetela, Topoke, Tutsi, Ungana, Vira, Wakuti, Yaka, Yakoma, Yanzi, Yeke, Yela etc.\n\nCentral Sudanic/Ubangian :\nNgbandi, Ngbaka, Manvu, Mbunja, Moru-Mangbetu, Zande, Logo, Lugbara\n\nNilotic peoples :\nAlur, Kakwa, Bari, Logo\n\nPygmy peoples :\nMbuti, Twa, Baka, Babinga\nMore than 600,000 pygmies (around 1% of the total population) are believed to live in the DR Congo's huge forests, where they survive by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe four major languages in the DRC are French (official), Lingala (a lingua franca trade language), Kingwana (a dialect of Swahili), Kikongo, and Tshiluba. There are over 200 ethnic languages.\n\nFrench is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it. In the town of Beni, for instance, there is a Bilingual University that offer courses in both French and English. President Kabila himself is fluent in both English and French, as was his father.\n\nReligions\n\nRoman Catholic 50%, Protestant 20%, Kimbanguist 10%, Islam 10%, Other (includes Syncretic Sects and Indigenous beliefs) 10% (CIA The World Factbook)\n\nRoman Catholic 43.9%, Protestant 24.8%, Other Christian 23.7%, Muslim 1.6%, Non-religious 0.6%, Hindu 0.1% other syncretic sects and indigenous beliefs 5.3% (Joshua project)[http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=CG Joshua Project - Congo, Democratic Republic of - Religions]\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nPopulation\n\n77,433,744\nNote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and gender than would otherwise be expected (July 2014 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\nTotal: 18.4 years\nMale: 18.1 years\nFemale: 18.6 years (2016 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.42% (2016)\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.54 migrant(s)/1,000 population\nnote: fighting between the Congolese Government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese rebels spawned a regional war in DRC in August 1998, which left 2.33 million Congolese internally displaced and caused 412,000 Congolese refugees to flee to surrounding countries (2011 est.)\n\nGiven the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data however evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.\n\nAdditionally, the country’s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.\n\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, the number of immigrants in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.\n\nFigures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including South Africa and various points en route to Europe.\n\nIn addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to UNHCR, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.\n\nGender ratio\n\nAt birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\nUnder 15 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n15–64 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.69 male(s)/female\nTotal population: 0.99 male(s)/female (2011 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 56.93 years\nmale: 55.39 years\nfemale: 58.51 years (2015 est.)[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html CIA \"The World Factbook\": DR Congo 2015.] Retrieved January 13, 2016.\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 4.2% (2003 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 1.3 million (2003 est.)\nDeaths: 100,000 (2003 est.)\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\nDegree of risk: very high\nFood or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever\nVectorborne diseases: malaria, plague, and African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) are high risks in some locations\nWater contact disease: schistosomiasis (2005)\n\nNationality\n\nNoun: Congolese (singular and plural)\nAdjective: Congolese or Congo\n\nLiteracy\n\nDefinition: age 15 and over can read and write French, Lingala, Kingwana, or Tshiluba\nTotal population: 65.5%\nMale: 76.2%\nFemale: 55.1% (2003 est.)\n\nCongolese diaspora \n\nThe table below shows DRC born people who have emigrated abroad in selected Western countries (although it excludes their descendants).[https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/democratic-republic-congo-migration-history-marked-crises-and-restrictions Flahaux M.-L. and Schoumaker B.
