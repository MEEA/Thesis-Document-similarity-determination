  "textBody" : "Fruitarianism is a diet that consists entirely or primarily of fruits in the botanical sense, and possibly nuts and seeds, without animal products. Fruitarianism is a subset of dietary veganism.\n\nFruitarianism may be adopted for different reasons, including ethical, religious, environmental, cultural, economic, and health reasons. There are many varieties of the diet. Some people whose diet consists of 75% or more fruit consider themselves fruitarians.\n\nDefinitions\n\nSome fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant: that is, foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant.Rod Preece, Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought, UBC Press, 2008, \"Since plants have life, it is necessary, if one is not to starve, to live from the fruit of the plant in such a manner that the host plant itself does not die.\"Catherine G. Ratzin Jackson, Nutrition for the recreational athlete, p. 95, CRC Press, 1995, , . \"The fruitarian diet usually consists of consuming those parts of the plant that are cast off or dropped from the plant and that do not involve the destruction of the plant itself.\"Patricia Samour, Handbook Of Pediatric Nutrition, Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2003, p. 143. \"A fruitarian diet consists of only fruits. Any plant food that is botanically a fruit or can be obtained without killing or harming the plant is considered a fruit.\" These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds. According to author Adam Gollner, some fruitarians eat only fallen fruit.Adam Leith Gollne, 'The Fruit Hunters, \"Some factions eat only fallen fruit. Others refuse to eat any seeds because they contain future plants.\" Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so, and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds as they contain future plants, or nuts and seeds,Dr Johnny Lovewisdom, The Ascensional Science of Spiritualizing Fruitarian Dietetics, Ecuador: International University of the Natural Vitalogical Sciences, 1999, Introduction: \"Nature is betrayed when man ingests the seeds of plants, depriving them of their means of propagating their own species\"; chapter: Sugar & Starch-Friends Or Foes? \"grains, nuts and other seeds are wrong as food sources\" or any foods besides juicy fruits.\"Ascensional Science teaches the damaging effects of chlorophyll leafage, earthly roots and lower passion producing seeds. We are healed by levitational forces in fruit sugars and acids.\" Introduction to Ascensional Science of Spiritualizing Fruitarian Dietetics, Johnny Lovewisdom, International University of the Natural Vitalogical Sciences, 1999 Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten. Others eat seeds and some cooked foods.[http://www.acorn.net/fruitarian/what.html \"What is a Fruitarian?\"]  Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as beans, peas, or other legumes. Other fruitarians' diets include raw fruits, dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil,Marie V. Krause, Food, nutrition, and diet therapy: a textbook of nutritional care, p. 343, Saunders, 1984, Original from the University of Michigan, Digitized August 19, 2008, , . \"The fruitarian diet consists of only raw or dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil.\" or fruits, nuts, beans and chocolate.John McCabe, Handbook of Sunfood Living: Resource Guide for Global Health, North Atlantic Books, 2008, \"other fruitarians also consume cucumbers, olives, tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, melon, avocados, berries, grapes, figs, dates, carob, chocolate, goji berries, nuts and even coconuts.\"\n\nMotivation\n\nSome fruitarians wish, like Jains, to avoid killing anything, including plants, and refer to ahimsa fruitarianism.\"ahim-sa\" - \"the Hindu and Buddhist doctrine of refraining from harming any living being\", Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ahinsa For some fruitarians, the motivation comes from a fixation on a utopian past, their hope being to return to a past that predates an agrarian society to when humans were simply gatherers. Another common motivation is the desire to eliminate perceived toxicity from within the body. For others, the appeal of a fruitarian diet comes from the challenge that the restrictive nature of this diet provides.\n\nNutritional concerns\n\nAccording to nutritionists, adults must be careful not to follow a fruit-only diet for too long.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1542293.stm \"Baby death parents spared jail\"]. BBC News, September 14, 2001. Accessed March 31, 2011. A fruitarian diet is wholly unsuitable for children (including teens), and several children have died due to having fruitarian diets imposed on them.\n\nNutritional deficiencies\n\nFruitarianism is even more restrictive than veganism or raw veganism.Audrey H. Ensminger, Foods & Nutrition Encyclopedia, CRC Press, 1993, \"Severely restrictive vegetarian diets, such as fruitarian and Zen macrobiotic diets, increase the risk of malnutrition and deficiency diseases.\" Maintaining this diet over a long period can result in dangerous deficiencies, a risk that many fruitarians try to ward off through nutritional testing and vitamin injections. The Health Promotion Program at Columbia University reports that a fruitarian diet can cause deficiencies in calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, most B vitamins (especially B12), and essential fatty acids.\n\nAlthough fruits provide a source of carbohydrates, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians need to be careful that they consume enough protein each day. When the body does not take in enough protein, it misses out on amino acids, which are essential to making body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues. Consuming high levels of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels. These high levels of sugar means that fruitarians are at high risk for tooth decay. Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating. A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.\nAdditionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation.Alice!, Health Promotion Program at Columbia University, Health Services at Columbia, August 23, 2002. [http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/fruitarian-teens-are-they-stunting-their-growth \"Go Ask Alice!: Fruitarian teens\"]. Accessed May 20, 2008. The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering orthorexia nervosa.\n\nVitamin B12\n\nVitamin B12, a bacterial product, cannot be obtained from fruits. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health \"natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to foods that come from animals.\" Like raw vegans who do not consume B12-fortified foods (certain plant milks and breakfast cereals, for example), fruitarians may need to include a B12 supplement in their diet or risk vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nGrowth and development issues\n\nIn children, growth and development may be at risk. Some nutritionists state that children should not follow a fruitarian diet. Nutritional problems include severe proteinâ€“energy malnutrition, anemia and deficiencies including proteins, iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, raw fibre and a wide range of vitamins and minerals.Holden, Chris, et al, Royal College of Nursing. Nutrition and Child Health, p. 59.

The little left of it was wiped out in the Spring of 1904 by a storm.
