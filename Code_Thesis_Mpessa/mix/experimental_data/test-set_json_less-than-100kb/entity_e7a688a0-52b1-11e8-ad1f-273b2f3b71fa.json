  "textBody" : "The dative case (abbreviated , or sometimes  when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used in some languages to indicate, among other uses, the noun to which something is given, as in \"Maria Jacobo potum dedit\", Latin for \"Maria gave Jacob a drink\". In these examples, the dative marks what would be considered the indirect object of a verb in English.\n\nSometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In Scottish Gaelic and Irish, the term dative case is used in traditional grammars to refer to the prepositional case-marking of nouns following simple prepositions and the definite article. In Georgian, the dative case also marks the subject of the sentence with some verbs and some tenses. This is called the dative construction.\n\nThe dative was common among early Indo-European languages and has survived to the present in the Balto-Slavic branch and the Germanic branch, among others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the Uralic family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In Ancient Greek, the dative has the functions of the Proto-Indo-European locative and instrumental as well as those of the original dative.\n\nUnder the influence of English, which uses the preposition \"to\" for (among other uses) both indirect objects (give to) and directions of movement (go to), the term \"dative\" has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called lative.\n\nEtymology\n\n\"Dative\" comes from Latin cāsus datīvus (\"case for giving\"), a translation of Greek δοτικὴ πτῶσις, dotikē ptôsis (\"inflection for giving\"), from its use with the verb didónai \"to give\". Dionysius Thrax in his Art of Grammar also refers to it as epistaltikḗ \"for sending (a letter)\",Dionysius Thrax. [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html τέχνη γραμματική] (Art of Grammar), section ιβ´ (10b): περὶ ὀνόματος (On the noun). Bibliotheca Augustana. from the verb epistéllō \"send to\", a word from the same root as epistle.\n\nEnglish\n\nThe Old English language, which continued in use until after the Norman Conquest of 1066, had a dative case; however, the English case system gradually fell into disuse during the Middle English period, when the accusative and dative of pronouns merged into a single oblique case that was also used with all prepositions. This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the \"accusative\" and \"dative\" labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term \"objective\" for oblique.\n\nSet expressions\n\nThe dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word \"methinks\", with the meaning \"it seems to me\". It survives in this fixed form from Old English (having undergone, however, phonetic changes with the rest of the language), in which it was constructed as \"[it]\" + \"me\" (the dative case of the personal pronoun) + \"thinks\" (i.e., \"seems\",  or Cui prodest? \"Whose interest does this serve?\" (literally \"To whom does this do good?\")\n*Dativus auctoris, meaning; 'in the eyes of', e.g., 'vir bonus mihi videtur' 'he seems to me to be a good man'.\n*The dative expresses agency with the gerundive when the gerundive is used to convey obligation or necessity, e.g., 'haec nobis agenda sunt,' 'these things must be done by us.'\n\nGreek\n\nAncient\n\nIn addition to its main function as the dativus, the dative case has other functions in Classical Greek:Morwood, James.  Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek. Oxford University Press, 2002.  () (The chart below uses the Latin names for the types of dative; the Greek name for the dative is δωτική πτώση, like its Latin equivalent, derived from the verb \"to give\"; in Ancient Greek, δίδωμι.)\n*Dativus finalis: The dativus finalis, or the 'dative of purpose', is when the dative is used to denote the purpose of a certain action. For example:\n**\"\"\n***\"I fight for the king\".\n**\"\"\n***\"I die for honour\".\n*Dativus commŏdi (incommodi): The dativus commodi sive incommodi, or the 'dative of benefit (or harm)' is the dative that expresses the advantage or disadvantage of something for someone.  For example:\n**For the benefit of: \"\" (Sophocles, Ajax 1366).\n***\"Every man toils for himself\".\n**For the harm or disadvantage of: \"\" (Thucydides 2.12.4).\n***\"This day will be the beginning of great sorrows for the Greeks (i.e., for their disadvantage)\".\n*Dativus possessivus: The dativus possessivus, or the 'dative of possession' is the dative used to denote the possessor of a certain object or objects. For example:\n**\"\" (Thucycdides 1.86.3).\n***\"For others have a lot of money and ships and horses, but we have good allies (i.e., To others there is a lot of money...)\".\n*Dativus ethicus: The dativus ethicus, or the 'ethic or polite dative,'  is when the dative is used to signify that the person or thing spoken of is regarded with interest by someone. This dative is mostly, if not exclusively, used in pronouns. As such, it is also called the \"dative of pronouns.\" For example:\n**\"\" (Demosthenes 18.178).\n***\"Pay close attention to this, I beg you (i.e., please pay..)\".\n**\"\" (Xenophon, Cyropaedia 18.178).\n***\"Oh, mother, how handsome grandpa is (I've just realized!)\".\n*Dativus auctoris: The dativus auctoris, or the 'dative of agent,' is the dative used to denote the doer of an action. Note, however, that in Classical Greek, the agent is usually in the genitive after  (by, at the hands of).  The agent is in the dative only with the perfect and pluperfect passive, and after the verbal adjective in .  For example:\n**\"\" (Isocrates 8.39)\n***\"Many cures have been discovered by doctors.\"\n*Dativus instrumenti:  The dativus instrumenti, or the 'dative of instrument,' is when the dative is used to denote an instrument or means of a certain action (or, more accurately, as the instrumental case). For example:\n**\".\" (Homer, Odyssey 9.407)\n***\"He kills me with a bait (i.e., by means of a bait).\"\n*Dativus modi: The dativus modi, or the 'dative of manner,' is the dative used to describe the manner or way by which something happened. For example:\n**\"\" (Thucydides 8.84)\n***\"having died of (from) a disease.\"\n*Dativus mensurae: The dativus mensurae, or the 'dative of measurement,' is the dative used to denote the measurement of difference.  For example:\n**\"\" (Plato, Phaedo  101a)\n***\"taller by a head.\"\n**\"\" (Plato, Laws 729d)\n***\"by far the best.\"\n\nThe articles in the Greek dative are\n\nNouns as well as adjectives receive suffixes. These vary according to the declension.\n\nModern\n\nThe dative case, strictly speaking, no longer exists in Modern Greek, except in fossilized expressions like δόξα τω Θεώ (from the ecclesiastical τῷ Θεῷ δόξα, \"Glory to God\") or εν τάξει (ἑν τάξει, lit. \"in order\", i.e. \"all right\" or \"OK\"). Otherwise, most of the functions of the dative have been subsumed in the accusative.\n\nSlavic languages\n\nIn Russian, the dative case is used for indicating the indirect object of an action (that to which something is given, thrown, read, etc.). In the instance where a person is the goal of motion, dative is used instead of accusative to indicate motion toward. This is usually achieved with the preposition κ + destination in dative case; К врачу, meaning \"to the doctor.\"\n\nDative is also the necessary case taken by certain prepositions when expressing certain ideas.  For instance, when the preposition по is used to mean \"along,\" its object is always in dative case, as in По бокам, meaning \"along the sides.\"\n\nOther Slavic languages apply the dative case (and the other cases) more or less the same way as does Russian, some languages may use the dative in other ways.  The following examples are from Polish:\n\n*after certain verbs (dziękować komuś \"to thank someone\", pomóc komuś \"to help someone\", wierzyć komuś \"to believe someone\")\n*in certain expressions (Czy podoba ci się piosenka? \"Do you like the song?\", Jest mi zimno \"I'm cold\", Jest nam smutno \"We're feeling sad\", Będzie wam trudniej... \"It will be more difficult for you guys\"), Śniło jej się, że... \"She dreamt that\"\n*dativus commodi to indicate action for somebody (Zbuduję temu człowiekowi dom \"I will build a house for this person\")\n*when something is taken away or something occurs to someone (Zdechł im pies \"Their dog died\"; Zabrali mu komputer \"They took away his computer\"; Zepsuł nam się samochód \"Our car broke down\"; Coś mi się przypomniało \"I just remembered something\")\n\nSome other kinds of dative use as found in the Serbo-Croatian language are: Dativus finalis (Titaniku u pomoć \"to Titanic's rescue\"), Dativus commodi/incommodi (Operi svojoj majci suđe \"Wash the dishes for your mother\"), Dativus possessivus (Ovcama je dlaka gusta \"Sheep's hair is thick\"), Dativus ethicus (Šta mi radi Boni? \"What is Boni doing? (I am especially interested in what it is)\") and Dativus auctoris (Izgleda mi okej \"It seems okay to me\").\n\nUnusual in other Indo-European branches but common among Slavic languages, endings of nouns and adjectives are different based on grammatical function.  Other factors are gender and number.  In some cases, the ending may not be obvious, even when those three factors (function, gender, number) are considered.  For example, in Polish, 'syn' (\"son\") and 'ojciec' (\"father\") are both masculine singular nouns, yet appear as syn → synowi and ojciec → ojcu in the dative.\n\nBaltic languages\n\nBoth Lithuanian and Latvian have a distinct dative case in the system of nominal declensions.\n\nLithuanian nouns preserve Indo-European inflections in the dative case fairly well: (o-stems) vaikas -> sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; (ā-stems) ranka -> sg. rankai, pl. rankoms; (i-stems) viltis -> sg. vilčiai, pl. viltims; (u-stems) sūnus -> sg. sūnui, pl. sūnums; (consonant stems) vanduo -> sg. vandeniui, pl. vandenims.\n\nAdjectives in the dative case receive pronominal endings (this might be the result of a more recent development): tas geras vaikas -> sg. tam geram vaikui, pl. tiems geriems vaikams.\n\nThe dative case in Latvian underwent further simplifications - the original masculine endings of both nouns and adjectives have been replaced with pronominal inflections: tas vīrs -> sg. tam vīram, pl.  vīriem. Also, the final \"s\" in all Dative forms has been dropped. The only exception is personal pronouns in the plural: mums (to us), jums (to you). Note that in colloquial Lithuanian the final \"s\" in the dative is often omitted, as well: time geriem vaikam.\n\nIn both Latvian and Lithuanian, the main function of the dative case is to render the indirect object in a sentence: (lt) aš duodu vyrui knygą; (lv) es dodu [duodu] vīram grāmatu - I am giving a book to the man.\n\nThe dative case can also be used with gerundives to indicate an action preceding or simultaneous with the main action in a sentence: (lt) jam įėjus, visi atsistojo - when he walked in, everybody stood up, lit. to him having walked in, all stood up; (lt) jai miegant, visi dirbo - while she slept, everybody was working, lit. to her sleeping, all were working.\n\nIn modern standard Lithuanian, Dative case is not required by prepositions, although in many dialects it is done frequently: (dial.) iki (+D) šiai dienai, (stand.) iki (+G) šios dienos - up until this day.\n\nIn Latvian, the dative case is taken by several prepositions in the singular and all  prepositions in the plural (due to peculiar historical changes): sg. bez (+G) tevis (without thee) ~ pl. bez (+D) jums (without you); sg. pa (+A) ceļu (along the road) ~ pl. pa (+D) ceļiem (along the roads).\n\nArmenian\n\nIn modern Eastern Armenian, the dative is attained by adding any article to the genitive:\n\ndog = շուն\n\nGEN > շան (of the dog; dog's) with no articles\n\nDAT > շանը or շանն (to the dog) with definite articles (-ն if preceding a vowel)\n\nDAT > մի շան (to a dog) with indefinite article\n\nDAT > շանս (to my dog) with 1st person possessive article\n\nDAT > շանդ (to your dog) with 2nd person possessive article\n\nThere is a general tendency to view -ին as the standard dative suffix, but only because that is its most productive (and therefore common) form. The suffix -ին as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -ի accompanied by the definite article -ն. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -ին:\n\nDefinite DAT > Ես գիրքը տվեցի տղային: (I gave the book to the boy)\n\nIndefinite DAT> Ես գիրքը տվեցի մի տղայի: (I gave the book to a boy)\n\nThe main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition to. In the use of \"giving\" verbs like give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring... the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer... the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are show, reach, look, approach...\n\nEastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition at, as in Meet me at nine o' clock.\n\nSanskrit\n\nThe dative case is known as the \"fourth case\" (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object as Sanskrit has seven other cases including an instrumental. The term \"dative\" is grammatically similar to the Sanskrit word \"datta\". \"Datta\" means \"gift\" or \"the act of giving\".\n\nNon-Indo-European languages\n\nHungarian\n\nAs with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, Dánielnek adtam ezt a könyvet (I gave this book to Dániel).\n\nIt has two suffixes, -nak and -nek; the correct one is selected by vowel harmony. The personal dative pronouns follow the -nek version:  nekem, neked, etc.\n\nThis case is also used to express \"for\" in certain circumstances, such as \"I bought a gift for Mother\".\n\nIn possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is NOT the dative form (rather, the attributive or possessive case)Ignatius Singer, 'Simplified Grammar of the Hungarian Language', 1882.\n\nFinnish\n\nFinnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the allative case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa köyhille (They donated all their money to the poor.)\n\nTsez\n\nIn the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the dative also takes the functions of the lative case in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb \"show\" (literally: \"make see\") is given below:\n\nThe dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as \"to have\".\n\nAs in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.\n\nVerbs of perception or emotion (like \"see\", \"know\", \"love\", \"want\") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case.  Note that in this example the \"pure\" dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used.",

The suffix -ին as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -ի accompanied by the definite article -ն. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -ին:\n\nDefinite DAT > Ես գիրքը տվեցի տղային: (I gave the book to the boy)\n\nIndefinite DAT> Ես գիրքը տվեցի մի տղայի: (I gave the book to a boy)\n\nThe main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition to. In the use of \"giving\" verbs like give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring... the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer... the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are show, reach, look, approach...\n\nEastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition at, as in Meet me at nine o' clock.\n\nSanskrit\n\nThe dative case is known as the \"fourth case\" (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object as Sanskrit has seven other cases including an instrumental. The term \"dative\" is grammatically similar to the Sanskrit word \"datta\". \"Datta\" means \"gift\" or \"the act of giving\".\n\nNon-Indo-European languages\n\nHungarian\n\nAs with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, Dánielnek adtam ezt a könyvet (I gave this book to Dániel).\n\nIt has two suffixes, -nak and -nek; the correct one is selected by vowel harmony. The personal dative pronouns follow the -nek version:  nekem, neked, etc.\n\nThis case is also used to express \"for\" in certain circumstances, such as \"I bought a gift for Mother\".\n\nIn possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is NOT the dative form (rather, the attributive or possessive case)Ignatius Singer, 'Simplified Grammar of the Hungarian Language', 1882.\n\nFinnish\n\nFinnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the allative case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa köyhille (They donated all their money to the poor.)\n\nTsez\n\nIn the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the dative also takes the functions of the lative case in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb \"show\" (literally: \"make see\") is given below:\n\nThe dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as \"to have\".\n\nAs in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.\n\nVerbs of perception or emotion (like \"see\", \"know\", \"love\", \"want\") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case.  Note that in this example the \"pure\" dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used. Dative case. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=8406."
