ISI also has partnered with businesses including IBM Corporation, Samsung Electronics Company, the Raytheon Company, GlobalFoundries Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation and Carl Zeiss AG, and currently is working with [http://us.micron.com/ Micron Technology, Inc.], Altera Corporation and Fujitsu Ltd.\n\nISI also operates the [https://www.mosis.com/ Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service] (MOSIS), a multi-project electronic circuit wafer service that has prototyped more than 60,000 chips since 1981. MOSIS provides design tools and pools circuit designs to produce specialty and low-volume chips for corporations, universities and other research entities worldwide.  The Institute also has given rise to several startup and spinoff companies in grid software, geospatial information fusion, machine translation, data integration and other technologies.\n\nHistory\n\nISI was founded by Keith Uncapher, who headed the computer research group at RAND Corporation in the 1960s and early 1970s.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/16/business/keith-w-uncapher-networking-pioneer-80.htmlhttp://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/12/local/me-keith12 Uncapher decided to leave RAND after his group’s funding was cut in 1971.  He approached the University of California at Los Angeles about creating an off-campus technology institute, but was told that a decision would take 15 months.  He then presented the concept to USC, which approved the proposal in five days. ISI was launched with three employees in 1972.  Its first proposal was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 30 days for $6 million.http://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/107692\n\nISI became one of the earliest nodes on ARPANET,http://www.cbi.umn.edu/iterations/kilker.html the predecessor to the Internet, and in 1977 figured prominently  in a demonstration of its international viability.http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_70s.html  ISI also helped refine the TCP/IP communications protocols fundamental to Net operations, and researcher Paul Mockapetris developed the now-familiar Domain Name System characterized by .com, .org, .net, .gov, and .eduhttp://internethalloffame.org/inductees/paul-mockapetris on which the Net still operates. (The names .com, .org et al. were invented at SRI International, an ongoing collaborator.)  Steve Crocker originated the Request for Comments (RFC) series, the written record of the network's technical structure and operation that both documented and shaped the emerging Internet.http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/steve-crocker Another ISI researcher, Danny Cohen, became first to implement packet voice and packet video over ARPANET, demonstrating the viability of packet switching for real-time applications.http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/danny-cohen\n\nJonathan Postel collaborated in development of TCP/IP, DNS and the SMTP protocol that supports email.http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/jon-postel He also edited the RFC for nearly three decades until his sudden death in 1998, when ISI colleagues assumed responsibility.  The Institute retained that role until 2009.  Postel simultaneously directed the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) and its predecessor, which assign Internet addresses.  IANA was administered from ISI until a nonprofit organization, ICANN, was created for that purpose in 1998.https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf\n\nOther achievements\n\nCohen was the first entity to implement, Voice Over Internet Protocol (Voice over IP or VOIP). Some of the first Net security applications, and one of the world's first portable computers, also originated at ISI.http://www.isi.edu/about/history/timeline/\n\nISI researchers also created or co-created the:\n*GLOBUS grid computing standardhttp://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401444/grid-computing/http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/article.php?id=220\n*LOOM knowledge representation language and environment, or LOOM (ontology) \n*MONARCH supercomputer-on-a-chiphttp://www.cs.sandia.gov/CSRI/Workshops/2009/FaultTolerantSpaceborne/presentations/T-1030-Prager-Raytheon-SpaceComp-Prager-Public.pdfhttp://www.ll.mit.edu/HPEC/agendas/proc04/abstracts/granacki_john.pdf\n*Soar (cognitive architecture) for developing intelligent behavioral systems\n\nIn 2011, several ISI natural language experts advised the IBM team that created Watson, the computer that became the first machine to win against human competitors on the Jeopardy!

Including ISI, USC is ranked first nationally in federal computer science research and development expenditures.\n\nOrganizational structure\n\nISI is organized into six divisions focused on differing areas of research expertise:\n*Internet and Networked Systems:  networking software and hardware, Internet security, decision systems and related areas\n*Computational Systems and Technology: quantum computing; supercomputing; cloud, wireless, reconfigurable and multicore computing; microarchitecture and electronics; science automation technologies; social networks and space systems\n*Intelligent Systems: artificial intelligence, including natural language, machine translation, information integration, social networks, knowledge engineering, multi-agent systems and robotics\n*Informatics: application of grid computing and other methods to healthcare discovery processes, practice and delivery \n*Advanced Electronics: MOSIS shared-services integrated circuit research and fabrication, CMOS and post-CMOS concepts, and biomimetics\n*Space Technology and Systems:  space research and hands-on involvement for students through the Space Engineering Research Center, operated jointly by ISI and USC.\n\nSmaller, specialized research groups operate within almost all divisions.\n\nISI is led by Executive Director Prem Natarajan, previously an executive vice president and principal scientist at Raytheon BBN Technologies. He is a natural language specialist with research interests that focus on optical character recognition, speech processing, and multimedia analysis.https://news.usc.edu/52870/former-raytheon-executive-natarajan-takes-the-helm-of-isi/ Natarajan joined ISI in 2013, succeeding USC Viterbi School vice dean John O'Brien, who served as interim executive director in 2012 and 2013.
