  "textBody" : "Cyril M. Kornbluth (July 2, 1923Rich, p. 16 et passim. – March 21, 1958) was an American science fiction author and a member of the Futurians. He used a variety of pen-names, including Cecil Corwin, S. D. Gottesman, Edward J. Bellin, Kenneth Falconer, Walter C. Davies, Simon Eisner, Jordan Park, Arthur Cooke, Paul Dennis Lavond, and Scott Mariner. The \"M\" in Kornbluth's name may have been in tribute to his wife, Mary Byers; Kornbluth's colleague and collaborator Frederik Pohl confirmed Kornbluth's lack of any actual middle name in at least one interview.Webster, Bud. [http://baens-universe.com/articles/Cyril_With_an_M__or__I_m_As_Kornbluth_as_Kansas_in Cyril With an M (or, I'm As Kornbluth as Kansas in August)] . Baen's Universe, February 5, 2009\n\nBiography\n\nKornbluth was born and grew up in the uptown Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, in New York City. He was of Polish Jewish descent,http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/125474/cyril-kornbluth-s-postwar-dystopias/ the son of a \"second-generation [American] Jew\" who ran his own tailor shop. According to his widow, Kornbluth was a \"precocious child\", learning to read by the age of three and writing his own stories by the time he was seven. He graduated high school at thirteen, received a CCNY scholarship at fourteen, and was \"thrown out for leading a student strike\" before graduating.\n\nAs a teenager, he became a member of the Futurians, an influential group of science fiction fans and writers. While a member of the Futurians, he met and became friends with Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, Donald A. Wollheim, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and his future wife Mary Byers. He also participated in the Fantasy Amateur Press Association.\n\nKornbluth served in the US Army during World War II (European 'Theatre'). He received a Bronze Star for his service in the Battle of the Bulge, where he served as a member of a heavy machine gun crew. Upon his discharge, he returned to finish his education, which had been interrupted by the war, at the University of Chicago. While living in Chicago he also worked at Trans-Radio Press, a news wire service. In 1951 he started writing full-time,Charles Platt, \"C. M. Kornbluth: A Study Of His Work and Interview With His Widow\", Foundation 17, September 1979, pp.57-63 returning to the East Coast where he collaborated on novels with his old Futurian friends Frederik Pohl and Judith Merril.\n\nWork\n\nKornbluth began writing at 15. His first solo story, \"The Rocket of 1955\", was published in Richard Wilson's fanzine Escape (Vol. 1, No 2, August 1939); his first collaboration, \"Stepsons of Mars,\" written with Richard Wilson and published under the name \"Ivar Towers\", appeared in the April 1940 Astonishing. His other short fiction includes \"The Little Black Bag\", \"The Marching Morons\", \"The Altar at Midnight\", \"MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie\", \"Gomez\" and \"The Advent on Channel 12\".\n\n\"The Little Black Bag\" was first adapted for television live on the television show Tales of Tomorrow on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the BBC in 1969 for its Out of the Unknown series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by Rod Serling for an episode of his Night Gallery series. This dramatization starred Burgess Meredith as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctor's license and become a homeless alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future (2098), which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently.\n\n\"The Marching Morons\" is a look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses – the precarious minority of the \"elite\" working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. In his introduction to The Best of C.M. Kornbluth, Pohl states that \"The Marching Morons\" is a direct sequel to \"The Little Black Bag\": it is easy to miss this, as \"Bag\" is set in the contemporary present while \"Morons\" takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of \"The Marching Morons\": a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to \"play doctor\". A future Earth similar to \"The Marching Morons\" – a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses – is used again in the final stages of Kornbluth & Pohl's Search the Sky.\n\n\"MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie\" (1957) is supposedly written by Kornbluth using notes by \"Cecil Corwin\", who has been declared insane and incarcerated, and who smuggles out in fortune cookies the ultimate secret of life. This fate is said to be Kornbluth's response to the unauthorized publication of \"Mask of Demeter\" (as by \"Corwin\" and \"Martin Pearson\" (Donald A. Wollheim)) in Wollheim's anthology Prize Science Fiction in 1953.\n\nBiographer Mark Rich describes the 1958 story \"Two Dooms\" as one of several stories which are \"concern[ed] with the ethics of theoretical science\" and which \"explore moral quandaries of the atomic age\":\n\nMany of Kornbluth's novels were written as collaborations: either with Judith Merril (using the pseudonym Cyril Judd), or with Frederik Pohl. These include  Gladiator-At-Lawand The Space Merchants. The Space Merchants contributed significantly to the maturing and to the wider academic respectability of the science fiction genre, not only in America but also in Europe.See for instance: Zoran Živković, Contemporaries of the Future – Savremenici budućnosti, Belgrade, Serbia, 1983, pp. 250–261. Kornbluth also wrote several novels under his own name, including The Syndic and Not This August.\n\nDeath\n\nKornbluth died at age 34 in Levittown, New York. Scheduled to meet with Bob Mills in New York City to interview for the position of editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction,Rich, Mark, C. M. Kornbluth: The Life and Works of a Science Fiction Visionary (McFarland & Co., 2010) p. 337 Kornbluth had to shovel snow from his driveway, which delayed him.  Running to meet his train, he suffered a fatal heart attack on the platform of the station.\n\nA number of short stories remained unfinished at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. One of these stories, \"The Meeting\" (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, November 1972), was the co-winner of the 1973 Hugo Award for Best Short Story; it tied with R. A. Lafferty's \"Eurema's Dam.\"http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html#73  Almost all of Kornbluth's solo SF stories have been collected as His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Science Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth (NESFA Press, 1997).\n\nPersonality and habits\n\nFrederik Pohl, in his autobiography The Way the Future Was, Damon Knight, in his memoir The Futurians, and Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs In Memory Yet Green and I. Asimov: A Memoir, all give descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and eccentricities.\n\nKornbluth, for example, decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories, in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ballista, an Ancient Roman weapon, Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the A's and had started on the B's.\n\nAccording to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.\n\nKornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were \"supposed to\" drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually \"weaned himself\" (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.\n\nBibliography\n\nNovels\n\n* Outpost Mars (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as Cyril Judd), first published as a Galaxy serial entitled Mars Child (May–July 1951) and later reprinted as Galaxy novel No. 46 retitled Sin in Space (1961)\n* Gunner Cade (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as Cyril Judd), first published as an Astounding Science Fiction serial (March–May 1952)\n* Takeoff (May 1952), later serialised in New Worlds (April–June 1954)\n* The Space Merchants (April 1953) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial entitled Gravy Planet (June–August 1952)\n* The Syndic (October 1953), later serialised in Science Fiction Adventures (December 1953-March 1954), entered the Prometheus Award Hall of Fame in 1986\n* Search the Sky (February 1954) (with Frederik Pohl), later revised by Pohl (October 1985)\n* Gladiator at Law (May 1955) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial (June–August 1954), later revised by Pohl (April 1986)\n* Not This August (July 1955) (AKA Christmas Eve), later revised by Pohl (December 1981)\n* Wolfbane (September 1959) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial (October–November 1957), later revised by Pohl (June 1986)\n\nCollections\n\n* The Explorers (1954)\n** \"Foreword\", [Frederik Pohl]\n** \"Gomez\", [original here]\n** \"The Mindworm\", 1950\n** \"The Rocket of 1955\", 1939\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1952-11/Galaxy_1952_11#page/n95/mode/2up The Altar at Midnight]\", 1952\n** \"Thirteen O’Clock\" [as by Cecil Corwin], (1941) \"Peter Packer\" series\n** \"The Goodly Creatures\", 1952\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/10_Story_Fantasy_v01n01_1951-Spring_Tawrast-EXciter#page/n25/mode/2up Friend to Man]\", 1951\n** \"With These Hands\", 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory\", 1962\n* The Mindworm and Other Stories (1955)\n** \"The Mindworm,\" (1950)\n** \"Gomez,\" 1954\n** \"The Rocket of 1955,\" 1939\n** \"The Altar at Midnight,\" 1952\n** \"The Little Black Bag,\" 1950\n** \"The Goodly Creatures,\" 1952\n** \"Friend to Man,\" 1951\n** \"With These Hands,\" 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory,\" 1952\n** \"The Luckiest Man in Denv\" [as by Simon Eisner], · 1952\n** \"The Silly Season,\" 1950\n** \"The Marching Morons · nv Galaxy Apr ’51\n* A Mile Beyond the Moon (1958) [abridged for its 1962 paperback reprint, see below]\n** \"Make Mine Mars,\" 1952\n** \"The Meddlers,\" 1953 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"The Events Leading Down to the Tragedy,\" 1958\n** \"The Little Black Bag,\" 1950 (related to \"The Marching Morons\")\n** \"Everybody Knows Joe,\" 1953\n** \"Time Bum,\" 1953\n** \"Passion Pills,\" [original here] [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Virginia,\" 1958\n** \"The Slave,\" 1957 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Kazam Collects\" [as by S.

Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie\", \"Gomez\" and \"The Advent on Channel 12\".\n\n\"The Little Black Bag\" was first adapted for television live on the television show Tales of Tomorrow on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the BBC in 1969 for its Out of the Unknown series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by Rod Serling for an episode of his Night Gallery series. This dramatization starred Burgess Meredith as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctor's license and become a homeless alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future (2098), which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently.\n\n\"The Marching Morons\" is a look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses – the precarious minority of the \"elite\" working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. In his introduction to The Best of C.M. Kornbluth, Pohl states that \"The Marching Morons\" is a direct sequel to \"The Little Black Bag\": it is easy to miss this, as \"Bag\" is set in the contemporary present while \"Morons\" takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of \"The Marching Morons\": a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to \"play doctor\". A future Earth similar to \"The Marching Morons\" – a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses – is used again in the final stages of Kornbluth & Pohl's Search the Sky.\n\n\"MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie\" (1957) is supposedly written by Kornbluth using notes by \"Cecil Corwin\", who has been declared insane and incarcerated, and who smuggles out in fortune cookies the ultimate secret of life. This fate is said to be Kornbluth's response to the unauthorized publication of \"Mask of Demeter\" (as by \"Corwin\" and \"Martin Pearson\" (Donald A. Wollheim)) in Wollheim's anthology Prize Science Fiction in 1953.\n\nBiographer Mark Rich describes the 1958 story \"Two Dooms\" as one of several stories which are \"concern[ed] with the ethics of theoretical science\" and which \"explore moral quandaries of the atomic age\":\n\nMany of Kornbluth's novels were written as collaborations: either with Judith Merril (using the pseudonym Cyril Judd), or with Frederik Pohl. These include  Gladiator-At-Lawand The Space Merchants. The Space Merchants contributed significantly to the maturing and to the wider academic respectability of the science fiction genre, not only in America but also in Europe.See for instance: Zoran Živković, Contemporaries of the Future – Savremenici budućnosti, Belgrade, Serbia, 1983, pp. 250–261. Kornbluth also wrote several novels under his own name, including The Syndic and Not This August.\n\nDeath\n\nKornbluth died at age 34 in Levittown, New York. Scheduled to meet with Bob Mills in New York City to interview for the position of editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction,Rich, Mark, C. M. Kornbluth: The Life and Works of a Science Fiction Visionary (McFarland & Co., 2010) p. 337 Kornbluth had to shovel snow from his driveway, which delayed him.  Running to meet his train, he suffered a fatal heart attack on the platform of the station.\n\nA number of short stories remained unfinished at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. One of these stories, \"The Meeting\" (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, November 1972), was the co-winner of the 1973 Hugo Award for Best Short Story; it tied with R. A. Lafferty's \"Eurema's Dam.\"http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html#73  Almost all of Kornbluth's solo SF stories have been collected as His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Science Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth (NESFA Press, 1997).\n\nPersonality and habits\n\nFrederik Pohl, in his autobiography The Way the Future Was, Damon Knight, in his memoir The Futurians, and Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs In Memory Yet Green and I. Asimov: A Memoir, all give descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and eccentricities.\n\nKornbluth, for example, decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories, in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ballista, an Ancient Roman weapon, Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the A's and had started on the B's.\n\nAccording to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.\n\nKornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were \"supposed to\" drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually \"weaned himself\" (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.\n\nBibliography\n\nNovels\n\n* Outpost Mars (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as Cyril Judd), first published as a Galaxy serial entitled Mars Child (May–July 1951) and later reprinted as Galaxy novel No. 46 retitled Sin in Space (1961)\n* Gunner Cade (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as Cyril Judd), first published as an Astounding Science Fiction serial (March–May 1952)\n* Takeoff (May 1952), later serialised in New Worlds (April–June 1954)\n* The Space Merchants (April 1953) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial entitled Gravy Planet (June–August 1952)\n* The Syndic (October 1953), later serialised in Science Fiction Adventures (December 1953-March 1954), entered the Prometheus Award Hall of Fame in 1986\n* Search the Sky (February 1954) (with Frederik Pohl), later revised by Pohl (October 1985)\n* Gladiator at Law (May 1955) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial (June–August 1954), later revised by Pohl (April 1986)\n* Not This August (July 1955) (AKA Christmas Eve), later revised by Pohl (December 1981)\n* Wolfbane (September 1959) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a Galaxy serial (October–November 1957), later revised by Pohl (June 1986)\n\nCollections\n\n* The Explorers (1954)\n** \"Foreword\", [Frederik Pohl]\n** \"Gomez\", [original here]\n** \"The Mindworm\", 1950\n** \"The Rocket of 1955\", 1939\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1952-11/Galaxy_1952_11#page/n95/mode/2up The Altar at Midnight]\", 1952\n** \"Thirteen O’Clock\" [as by Cecil Corwin], (1941) \"Peter Packer\" series\n** \"The Goodly Creatures\", 1952\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/10_Story_Fantasy_v01n01_1951-Spring_Tawrast-EXciter#page/n25/mode/2up Friend to Man]\", 1951\n** \"With These Hands\", 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory\", 1962\n* The Mindworm and Other Stories (1955)\n** \"The Mindworm,\" (1950)\n** \"Gomez,\" 1954\n** \"The Rocket of 1955,\" 1939\n** \"The Altar at Midnight,\" 1952\n** \"The Little Black Bag,\" 1950\n** \"The Goodly Creatures,\" 1952\n** \"Friend to Man,\" 1951\n** \"With These Hands,\" 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory,\" 1952\n** \"The Luckiest Man in Denv\" [as by Simon Eisner], · 1952\n** \"The Silly Season,\" 1950\n** \"The Marching Morons · nv Galaxy Apr ’51\n* A Mile Beyond the Moon (1958) [abridged for its 1962 paperback reprint, see below]\n** \"Make Mine Mars,\" 1952\n** \"The Meddlers,\" 1953 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"The Events Leading Down to the Tragedy,\" 1958\n** \"The Little Black Bag,\" 1950 (related to \"The Marching Morons\")\n** \"Everybody Knows Joe,\" 1953\n** \"Time Bum,\" 1953\n** \"Passion Pills,\" [original here] [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Virginia,\" 1958\n** \"The Slave,\" 1957 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Kazam Collects\" [as by S.

This reflects editorial choice more than reality, because Kornbluth also wrote delightful humor in his last years, in stories not collected here.
