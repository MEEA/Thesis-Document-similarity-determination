  "textBody" : "The geographical mile is a unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc along the Earth's equator.  For the 1924 International Spheroid this equalled 1855.4 metres.  Any greater precision depends more on choice of standard than on more careful measurement: the length of the equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is  which makes the geographical mile 1855.3248 m, while the International Astronomical Union standard IAU-2000 takes the equator to be  making the geographical mile 1855.3257 m, almost a millimetre longer. In any standard, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles.\n\nRelated units\n\nIt was closely related to the nautical mile, which was originally determined as 1 minute of arc along a great circle of the Earth, but is nowadays defined as exactly 1852 metres.
