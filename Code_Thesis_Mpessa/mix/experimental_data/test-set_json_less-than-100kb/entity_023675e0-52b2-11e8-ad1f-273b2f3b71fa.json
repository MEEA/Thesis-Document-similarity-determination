  "textBody" : "Gibberish, alternatively jibberish, jibber-jabber, or gobbledygook, is language that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words, or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders. Gibberish should not be confused with literary nonsense such as that used in the poem \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll.\n\nThe word gibberish is more commonly applied to informal speech, while gobbledygook (sometimes gobbledegook, gobbledigook or gobbledegoo) is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms.  \"Officialese\", \"legalese\", or \"bureaucratese\" are forms of gobbledygook. The related word jibber-jabber refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term gibberish was first seen in English in the early 16th century. Its etymology is not certain, but it is generally thought to be an onomatopoeia imitative of speech, similar to the words jabber (to talk rapidly) and gibber (to speak inarticulately).\n\nIt may originate from the word jib, which is the Angloromani variant of the Romani language word meaning \"language\" or \"tongue\". To non-speakers, the Anglo-Romany dialect could sound like English mixed with nonsense words, and if those seemingly-nonsensical words are referred to as \"jib\" then the term \"gibberish\" (pronounced \"jibberish\") could be derived as a descriptor for nonsensical speech. Another theory is that gibberish came from the name of a famous 8th-century Persian chemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān, whose name was Latinized as \"Geber.\" Thus, \"gibberish\" was a reference to the incomprehensible technical jargon used by Jabir and other alchemists.\n\nA discredited alternative theory asserts that it is derived from the Irish word gob or gab (mouth) or from the Irish phrase Geab ar ais (back talk, backward chat). The latter Irish etymology was suggested by Daniel Cassidy, whose work has been criticised by linguists and scholars. The terms geab and geabaire are certainly Irish words, but the phrase geab ar ais does not exist, and the word gibberish exists as a loan-word in Irish as gibiris.\n\nThe term gobbledygook was coined by Maury Maverick, a former congressman from Texas and former mayor of San Antonio.[http://www.waywordradio.org/maverick-and-gobbledygook-minicast Maverick and Gobbledygook (minicast)], A Way with Words, accessed 2017-01-28. When Maverick was chairman of the Smaller War Plants Corporation during World War II, he sent a memorandum that said: \"Be short and use Plain English. . . . Stay off gobbledygook language.\" Later, writing in the New York Times Magazine, he defined gobbledygook as \"talk or writing which is long, pompous, vague, involved, usually with Latinized words.\" The allusion was to a turkey, \"always gobbledygobbling and strutting with ridiculous pomposity.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe term \"gobbledygook\" has a long history of usage in politics.  Nixon's Oval Office tape from June 14, 1971, showed H. R. Haldeman describing a situation to Nixon as \"a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: you can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say.\" President Ronald Reagan explained tax law revisions in an address to the nation with the word, May 28, 1985, saying that \"most didn’t improve the system; they made it more like Washington itself: complicated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and loopholes designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers.\"[http://www.bartleby.com/63/38/338.html Simpson’s Contemporary Quotations] at Bartleby.com  In 2017, US Supreme Court justice John Roberts dismissed quantitative sociological reasoning as \"gobbledygook\" in arguing against any numerical test for gerrymandering.\n\nMichael Shanks, former chairman to the National Consumer Council of Great Britain, characterizes professional gobbledygook as sloppy jargon intended to confuse nonspecialists: \"'Gobbledygook' may indicate a failure to think clearly, a contempt for one's clients, or more probably a mixture of both.
