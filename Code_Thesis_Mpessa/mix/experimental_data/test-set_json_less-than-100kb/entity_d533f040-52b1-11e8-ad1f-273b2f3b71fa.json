The options available to citizens and tourists include railways, roadways, waterways, pipelines, and airlines. These avenues of transportation are used by citizens for personal transportation, by businesses for transporting goods, and by tourists for both accessing the country and traveling while there.\n\nRailways \n\nRailways in Cameroon are operated by Camrail, a subsidiary of French investment group Bolloré. As of May 2014 Camrail operated regular daily services on three routes:Cameroon, seat61, http://www.seat61.com/Cameroon.htm#.U2JoEcfEc7A\n\nDouala - KumbaTimetable, 2014, http://www.camrail.net/h_dla_kum.html\n\nDouala - YaoundéTimetable, 2014, http://www.camrail.net/h_dla_yde.html\n\nYaoundé - NgaoundéréTimetable, 2014, http://www.camrail.net/h_dla_nge.html\n\nThere are no rail links with neighbouring countries.\n\nRoadways \n\nTotal highways: 50,000 km\nPaved: 5,000 km\nUnpaved: 45,000 km (2004)\n\nCameroon lies at a key point in the Trans-African Highway network, with three routes crossing its territory:\n* Dakar-N'Djamena Highway, connecting just over the Cameroon border with the N'Djamena-Djibouti Highway\n* Lagos-Mombasa Highway\n* Tripoli-Cape Town Highway\nCameroon's central location in the network means that efforts to close the gaps which exist in the network across Central Africa rely on the Cameroon's participation in maintaining the network, and the network has the potential to have a profound influence on Cameroon's regional trade. Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. It is likely for instance that within a decade, a great deal of trade between West Africa and Southern Africa will be moving on the network through Yaoundé.\n\nNational highways in Cameroon:\n\n*N1: Yaoundé - Bertoua - Ngaoundéré - Garoua - Maroua - Kouséri, border with Chad.\n*N2: Yaoundé - Mbalmayo - Ebolowa - Woleu Ntem, border with Gabon.\n*N3: Yaoundé - Edéa - Douala - Idenau.\n*N4: Yaoundé - Bafia - Bafoussam.\n*N5: Douala - Nkongsamba - Bafang - Bafoussam.\n*N6: Ejagham, border with Nigeria - Bamenda - Bafoussam - Tibati - Lokoti.\n*N7: Edéa - Kribi.\n*N8: Mutengene - Kumba - Mamfé.\n*N9: Mbalmayo - Nki, border with Congo.\n*N10: Yaoundé - Bertoua - Batouri - Kenzou, border with the Central African Republic.\n\nPrices of petrol rose steadily in 2007 and 2008, leading to a transport union strike in Douala on 25 February 2008.
