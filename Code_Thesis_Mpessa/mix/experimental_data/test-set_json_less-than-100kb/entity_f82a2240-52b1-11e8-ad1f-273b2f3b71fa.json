  "textBody" : "The Fields Medal is a prize awarded to two, three, or four mathematicians under 40 years of age at the International Congress of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years (on even years).\n\nThe Fields Medal is, with the Abel Prize, viewed as the highest honour a mathematician can receive. The Fields Medal and the Abel Prize have often been described as the mathematician's \"Nobel Prize\". \n\nThe Fields Medal differs from the Abel in view of the age restriction mentioned above, and in its frequency (awarded once every four years).\n\nThe prize comes with a monetary award, which since 2006 has been $15,000 CAD.[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id\n185366 Israeli wins 'Nobel' of Mathematics], JPost.com The colloquial name is in honour of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields. Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal itself, and funding the monetary component.\n\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian and first woman to win the Fields Medal.\n\nConditions of the award\n\nThe Fields Medal is often described as the \"Nobel Prize of Mathematics\" and for a long time was regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics. Unlike the Nobel Prize, however, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years.  The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. This is similar to restrictions applicable to the Clark Medal in economics. The under-40 rule is based on Fields' desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\"\n\nThe monetary award is much lower than the 8,000,000 Swedish kronor (roughly 1,400,000 Canadian dollars)On 1 April 2014 at 15:32 UTC, 8,000,000 Swedish kronor was worth $1,360,970 Canadian according to the OANDA currency converter. given with each Nobel prize as of 2014. Other major awards in mathematics, such as the Abel Prize and the Chern Medal, have larger monetary prizes compared to the Fields Medal.\n\nFields medalists\n\nLandmarks\n\nIn 1954, Jean-Pierre Serre became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27. He still retains this distinction.\n\nIn 1966, Alexander Grothendieck boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe. Léon Motchane, founder and director of the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.\n\nIn 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.\n\nIn 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: \"I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.\"[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Margulis.html Margulis biography], School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland.
