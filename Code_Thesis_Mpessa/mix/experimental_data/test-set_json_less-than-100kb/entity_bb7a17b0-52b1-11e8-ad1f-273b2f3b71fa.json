  "textBody" : "Anaximenes of Lampsacus () (320 BC) was a Greek rhetorician and historian.\n\nRhetorical works\n\nAnaximenes was a pupil of ZoilusD.A. Russell, \"Anaximenes (2),\" Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., rev., 2003. and, like his teacher, wrote a work on Homer. As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of Isocrates and his school. He is generally regarded as the author of the Rhetoric to Alexander, an Art of Rhetoric included in the traditional corpus of Aristotle's works.  Quintilian seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in Institutio Oratoria [http://honeyl.public.iastate.edu/quintilian/3/chapter4.html#9 3.4.9], as the Italian Renaissance philologist Piero Vettori first recognized.  This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.\n\nThe [https://books.google.com/books?idUdyFQ4a9HOMC&pg\nPR58#vonepage&q\n&f=false hypothesis] to Isocrates' Helen mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a Helen, \"though it is more a defense speech (apologia) than an encomium,\" and concludes that he was \"the man who has written about Helen\" to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. Helen 14).  Jebb entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the Encomium of Helen ascribed to Gorgias: \"It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias.\"R.C. Jebb, The Attic Orators, London, 1893, vol. II, p. 98.\n\nAccording to Pausanias ([https://books.google.com/books?idhsLNAAAAMAAJ&pg\nPA310#vonepage&q\n&ffalse 6.18.6]), Anaximenes was \"the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously.\"  He also worked as a logographer, having written the speech prosecuting Phryne according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by Athenaeus [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus13c.html#591 XIII.591e]).  The \"ethical\" fragments preserved in Stobaeus' Florilegium may represent \"some philosophical book.\"\n\nHistorical works\n\nAnaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of Epaminondas at the Battle of Mantinea (Hellenica, ), and a history of Philip of Macedon (Philippica).  He was a favorite of Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns, and wrote a third historical work on Alexander (however, Pausanias [https://books.google.com/books?id\nhsLNAAAAMAAJ&pgPA310#v\nonepage&q&f\nfalse 6.18.6] expresses doubt about his authorship of an epic poem on Alexander).  He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the Alexandrian canon.\n\nDidymus reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of Demosthenes (Against the Letter of Philip) could be found in almost identical form in Book 7 of Anaximenes' Philippica, and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes.Raphael Sealey, Demosthenes in His Time, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 239f.  The Letter of Philip (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers. The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.Jacoby, commentary on Anaximenes in FGrHist.\n\nAnaximenes was hostile to Theopompus, whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, Trikaranos, published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.J.P. Mahaffy, The Prose Writers from Isocrates to Aristotle, London, 1904, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id\niArl6eYqCNsC&pgPA38#v\nonepage&q&f\nfalse 38]-41.\n\nPlutarch criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and Ephorus, for the \"rhetorical effects and grand periods\" these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances (Praecepta gerendae reipublicae [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Praecepta_gerendae_reipublicae*.html#T803b 803b]).\n\nEditions and translations\n\n* Art of Rhetoric\n** edited by Immanuel Bekker, Oxford 1837 ([https://books.google.com/books?idgtM9AAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA169#vonepage&q\n&f=false online])\n** [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ugDAAAAQAAJ Anaximenis ars rhetorica], L.
