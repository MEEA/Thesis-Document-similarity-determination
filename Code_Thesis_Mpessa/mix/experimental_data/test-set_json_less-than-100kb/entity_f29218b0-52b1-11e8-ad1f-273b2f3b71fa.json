  "textBody" : "An elf (plural: elves) is a type of human-shaped supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.For discussion of a previous formulation of this sentence, see Ármann Jakobsson 2015. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.\n\nThe word elf is found throughout the Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'. Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by Christians, in Old and Middle English, medieval German, and Old Norse. These associate elves variously with the gods of Norse mythology, with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction. \n\nAfter the medieval period, the word elf tended to become less common throughout the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc (\"dwarf\") in German and huldra (\"hidden being\") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French into all the Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued to be associated with causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.\n\nFrom this Romanticist elite culture came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The \"Christmas elves\" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien; these re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and human-like beings. Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games and thereby continue to have a role in shaping people's understandings of their own real-life identities.\n\nRelationship to Christian cosmologies \n\nRecent scholars have emphasised, in the words of Ármann Jakobsson, that:the time has come to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.2006, 230–31; cf. Shippey 2005; Hall 2007, 16–17; Gunnell 2007.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.\n\nThere is no doubt that beliefs about elves have their origins before the conversion to Christianity and associated Christianization of north-west Europe. For this reason, belief in elves has, from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled \"pagan\" and a \"superstition\". However, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians (whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of Germanic-speakers' Christian culture and not merely relic of their pre-Christian religion. Accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and Christian cosmology has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.Jolly 1996; Shippey 2005; Green 2016.\n\nHistorically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology, all of which are found widely across time and space:\n\n* Identifying elves with the demons of Judaeo-Christian-Mediterranean tradition.e.g.  For example:\n** In English-language material: in the Royal Prayer Book from c. 900, elf appears as a gloss for \"Satan\".Hall 2007, 71–72. In the late-fourteenth-century Wife of Bath’s Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer equates male elves with incubi (demons which rape sleeping women).Hall 2007, 162. In the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials, witnesses' descriptions of encounters with elves were often interpreted by prosecutors as encounters with the Devil.Hall 2005, 30–32.\n** In medieval Scandinavia, Snorri Sturluson wrote in his Prose Edda of ljósálfar and døkkálfar ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ljósálfar living in the heavens and the døkkálfar under the earth. The consensus of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.Shippey 2005, 180–81; Hall 2007, 23–26; Gunnell 2007, 127–28; Tolley 2009, I 220.\n** Elves appear as demonic forces widely in medieval and early modern English, German, and Scandinavian prayers.Hall 2007, 69–74, 106 n. 48 and 122 on English evidence; Hall 2007, 98 fn 10 and Schulz 2000, 62–85 on German evidence; Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54–58 on Icelandic evidence.\n* Viewing elves as being more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology.e.g. Hall 2007, 172–75. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not explicitly try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, that may or may not be Christian.Shippey 2005, 161–68; Alver and Selberg 1987. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert the dominance of the Church.Ingwersen 1995, 83–89.\n* Integrating elves into Christian cosmology without identifying them as demons.e.g. Shippey 2005. The most striking examples are serious theological treatises: the Icelandic Tíðfordrif (1644) by Jón Guðmundsson lærði or, in Scotland, Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1691). This approach also appears in the Old English poem Beowulf, which lists elves among the races springing from Cain's murder of Abel.Hall 2007, 69–74. The late thirteenth-century South English Legendary and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God, and were banished by God to earth rather than hell. One famous Icelandic folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve.Hall 2007, 75; Shippey 2005, 174, 185–86.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe English word elf is from the Old English word most often attested as ælf (whose plural would have been *ælfe). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form elf during the Middle English period.Hall 2007, 176–81. During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ælfen, putatively from common Germanic *ɑlβ(i)innjō), but during the Middle English period the word elf came routinely to include female beings.Hall 2007, 75–88, 157–66.\n\nThe main medieval Germanic cognates (words of a common origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside the feminine elbe).Hall 2007, 5. These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.Hall 2007, 5, 176–77.\n\nGermanic *ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z is generally agreed to be cognate with the Latin albus ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ailbhín ('flock'); Albanian elb ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic álpt. These all come from an Indo-European base *albh-, and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant \"white person\", perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar, suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called \"the white people\" because they were regarded as beautiful.Hall 2007, 54–55.\n\nA completely different etymology, making elf cognate with the Rbhus, semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by Kuhn, in 1855.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nwvRTAAAAcAAJ&pgPA110 Kuhn 1855, 110]; [https://books.google.com/books?id\nfV8SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA163 Schrader 1890, 163]. In this case, *ɑlβi-z connotes the meaning, \"skillful, inventive, clever\", and is cognate with Latin labor, in the sense of \"creative work\". While often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.Hall 2007, 54–55 fn. 1.\n\nElves in proper names \n\nThroughout the medieval Germanic languages, elf was one of the nouns that was used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.Hall 2007, 56.\n\nPersonal names provide the only evidence for elf in Gothic, which must have had the word *albs (plural *albeis). The most famous name of this kind is Alboin. Old English names in elf- include the cognate of Alboin Ælfwine (literally \"elf-friend\", m.), Ælfric (\"elf-powerful\", m.), Ælfweard (\"elf-guardian\", m.), and Ælfwaru (\"elf-care\", f.). A widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred (Old English Ælfrēd, \"elf-advice\"). Also surviving are the English surname Elgar (Ælfgar, \"elf-spear\") and the name of St Alphege (Ælfhēah, \"elf-high\"). German examples are Alberich, Alphart and Alphere (father of Walter of Aquitaine)Paul 1900, 268. and Icelandic examples include Álfhildur. These names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Of the many words for supernatural beings in Germanic languages, the only ones used in personal names are elf and words denoting pagan gods, suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods.Hall 2007, 55–62.\n\nIn later Old Icelandic, alfr (\"elf\") and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been *Aþa(l)wulfaz both coincidentally became álfr~Álfr.De Vreis 1962, s.v. Álfr.\n\nElves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden (\"elves' hill\", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill (\"Elves' hill\", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley (\"elves' valley\", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.Hall 2007, 64–66\n\nElves in medieval texts and post-medieval folk-belief \n\nMedieval English-language sources \n\nElves as causes of illness \n\nThe earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any Germanic language are from Anglo-Saxon England. Medieval English evidence has, therefore, attracted quite extensive research and debate.Jolly 1996.Shippey 2005.Hall 2007.Green 2016. In Old English, elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and livestock with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm Wið færstice (\"against a stabbing pain\"), from the tenth-century compilation Lacnunga, but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century Bald's Leechbook and Leechbook III. This tradition continues into later English-language traditions too: elves continue to appear in Middle English medical texts.Hall 2007, 88–89, 141; Green 2003; Hall 2006. \n\nBeliefs in elves causing illness remained prominent in early modern Scotland, where elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people.Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005. Thus, elves were often mentioned in the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials: many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves.Purkiss 2000, 85-115; Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005.Hall 2007, 112–15. Throughout these sources, elves are sometimes associated with the succuba-like supernatural being called the mare.Hall 2007, 124–26, 128–29, 136–37, 156. \n\nWhile they may have been thought to cause disease with magical weapons, elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English sīden and sīdsa, cognate with Old Norse seiðr, and also paralleled in the Old Irish Serglige Con Culainn.Hall 2007, 119–56; Tolley 2009, I 221.  By the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy.Hall 2007, 88–89, 141; Green 2003; Hall 2006.\n\n\"Elf-shot\" \n\nIn one or two Old English medical texts, elves might be envisaged as inflicting illness with projectiles. In the twentieth century, scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as \"elf-shot\", but work from the 1990s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves being thought to cause illness in this way is slender;Hall 2007, 96–118. debate about its significance is ongoing.Tolley 2009, I 220. \n\nThe noun elf-shot is actually first attested in a Scots poem, \"Rowlis Cursing\", from around 1500, where \"elf schot\" is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken-thieves.Hall 2005b, 23. The term may not always have denoted an actual projectile: shot could mean \"a sharp pain\" as well as \"projectile\". But in early modern Scotland elf-schot and other terms like elf-arrowhead are sometimes used of neolithic arrow-heads, apparently thought to have been made by elves. In a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrrow-heads were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged that witches (and perhaps elves) used them to injure people and cattle.Hall 2005. Compare with the following excerpt from a 1749–50 ode by William Collins:\n\nThere every herd, by sad experience, knows\nHow, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly,\nWhen the sick ewe her summer food forgoes,\nOr, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie.Carlyle 1788, i 68, stanza II. 1749 date of composition is given on p. 63.\n\nSize, appearance, and sexuality \n\nBecause of elves' association with illness, in the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. This was encouraged by the idea that \"elf-shot\" is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection.Grattan and Singer 1952, frontispiece. However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons.Jolly 1998. Rather, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish Aos Sí, were regarded as people.Shippey 2005, 168–76; Hall 2007, esp. 172–75. \n\nLike words for gods and men, the word elf is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not. Just as álfar are associated with Æsir in Old Norse, the Old English Wið færstice associates elves with ēse; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods.Hall 2007, 35–63. In Old English, the plural ylfe (attested in Beowulf) is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people.Huld 1998; Hall 2007, 62–63; Tolley 2009, I 209. As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word ælf and its feminine derivative ælbinne were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs. This fits well with the word ælfscȳne, which meant \"elf-beautiful\" and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines Sarah and Judith.Hall 2007, 75–95. \n\nLikewise, in Middle English and early modern Scottish evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings.Hall 2007, 157–66; Shippey 2005, 172–76. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly with the idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material.Shippey 2005, 175–76; Hall 2007, 130–48; Green 2016, 76–109. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.Green 2016, 110–46.\n\nDecline in the use of the word elf \n\nBy the end of the medieval period, elf was increasingly being supplanted by the French loan-word fairy.Hall 2005, 20. An example is Geoffrey Chaucer's satirical tale Sir Thopas, where the title character sets out in quest of the \"elf-queen\", who dwells in the \"countree of the Faerie\".\n\nOld Norse texts \n\nMythological texts \n\nEvidence for elf-beliefs in medieval Scandinavia outside Iceland is very sparse, but the Icelandic evidence is uniquely rich. For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, which talks about svartálfar, dökkálfar and ljósálfar (\"black elves\", \"dark elves\", and \"light elves\"). However, these words are only attested in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves, demons, and angels, partly showing Snorri's \"paganisation\" of a Christian cosmology learned from the Elucidarius, a popular digest of Christian thought.\n\nScholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is Völundr, the protagonist of Völundarkviða.Dumézil 1973, 3. However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase Æsir ok Álfar ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the Æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and Æsir were one and the same.Hall 2007, 34–39Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 49–50. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wið færsticeHall 2007, 35–63 and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word elf is used in the same way as words for gods.Hall 2007, 28–32. Sigvatr Þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue Austrfaravísur, composed around 1020, mentions an álfablót (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden.Hall 2007, 30–31. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants.Hall 2007, 31–34, 42, 47–53. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.Hall 2007, 32–33.\n\nThere are hints that the god Freyr was associated with elves. In particular, Álfheimr (literally \"elf-world\") is mentioned as being given to Freyr in Grímnismál. Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the Vanir. However, the term Vanir is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages. Given the link between Freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that álfar and Vanir are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings.Simek 2010; Hall 27, 35–37; Frog and Roper 2011. However, this is not uniformly accepted.Tolley 2009, I 210–17.\n\nA kenning (poetic metaphor) for the sun, álfröðull (literally \"elf disc\"), is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun.; .\n\nAlthough the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr is described as one of the elves in Völundarkviða.Ármann Jakobsson 2006; Hall 2007, 39–47. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 50-52. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.Hall 2007, 133–34.\n\nOther sources \n\nThe appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre. The Sagas of Icelanders, Bishops' Sagas, and Contemporary sagas, whose portrayal of the supernatural is generally restrained, rarely mention álfar, and then only in passing.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231. But although limited, these texts provide some of the best evidence for the presence of elves in everyday beliefs in medieval Scandinavia. They include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in 1168 (in Sturlunga saga); mention of an álfablót (\"elves' sacrifice\") in Kormáks saga; and the existence of the euphemism ganga álfrek ('go to drive away the elves') for \"going to the toilet\" in Eyrbyggja saga.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231; Tolley 2009, I 217–18.\n\nThe Kings' sagas include a rather elliptical but widely studied account of an early Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called Ólafr Geirstaðaálfr ('Ólafr the elf of Geirstaðir'), and a demonic elf at the beginning of Norna-Gests þáttr.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231–32; Hall 2007, 26–27; Tolley 2009, I 218–19.\n\nThe legendary sagas tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of Álfheimr is found in Heimskringla while Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men.[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/viking/001_02.php The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son] (Old Norse original: [http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/thorstei.htm Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]). Chapter 1. Ashman Rowe 2010, 11-12. According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The Þiðreks saga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, Völsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 232. The relatively few mentions of elves in the Chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 52–54.\n\nBoth Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts, sometimes in Latin and sometimes in the form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.Hall 2007, 132–33.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54–58.Simek 2011.\n\nMedieval and early modern German texts \n\nThe Old High German word alp is attested only in a small number of glosses. It is defined by the Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch as a \"nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the mare he messes around with women\".'Naturgott oder -dämon, den Faunen der antiken Mythologie gleichgesetzt ... er gilt als gespenstisches, heimtückisches Wesen ... als Nachtmahr spielt er den Frauen mit'; Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v. alb. Accordingly, the German word Alpdruck (literally \"elf-oppression\") means \"nightmare\". There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.Edwards 1994.\n\nIn a similar vein, elves are in Middle German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people \"in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: die elben/der alp trieget mich (\"the elves/elf are/is deceiving me\").Edwards 1994, 16–17, at 17. The same pattern holds in Early Modern German.(Stallybrass tr.) In Lexer's Middle High German dictionary under [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/Lexer/?sigleLexer&mode\nVernetzung&lemidLA00984 alp, alb] is an example: Pf.  arzb. 2 14b\n  (): \"Swen der alp triuget, rouchet er sich mit der verbena, ime enwirret als pald niht;\" meaning: 'When an alp deceives you, fumigate yourself with verbena and the confusion will soon be gone'. The editor glosses alp here as \"malicious, teasing spirit\" ()  This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth-century Heinrich von Morungen's fifth Minnesang begins \"Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man / Sô bin ich von grôzer lieber entsên\" (\"full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love\").Edwards 1994, 13. Elbe was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.Edwards 1994, 17.\n\nIn later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe.Hall 2007, 125–26. Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.Edwards 1994, 21–22.\n\nAs in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. It seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves ().Motz 1983, esp. 23–66. Thus, some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves. In particular, nineteenth-century scholars tended to think that the dwarf Alberich, whose name etymologically means \"elf-powerful\", was influenced by early traditions of elves.Weston 1903, 144.(Stallybrass tr.) \n\nElves in post-medieval folklore \n\nEngland \n\nFrom around the Late Middle Ages, the word elf began to be used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy;Hall 2005, 20–21. in elite art and literature, at least, it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.Bergman 2011, 62-74.\n\nHowever, in Scotland and parts of northern England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales,Henderson and Cowan 2001. There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as Thomas the Rhymer, where a man meets a female elf; Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.Taylor 2014, 199-251.\n\nScandinavia \n\nTerminology\n\nIn Scandinavian folklore, a diverse array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might be thought of as elves and which might partly originate in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further complicated by the fact that when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.Olrik 1915–30\n\nAppearance and behaviour\n\nThe elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones. The Swedish älvor were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king.For the Swedish belief in älvor see mainly . Chapter: \"Scandinavia: Elves\" \n\nThe elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a circle where they had danced, which were called älvdanser (elf dances) or älvringar (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. Typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle. In the words of the local historian Anne Marie Hellström:\n\n...on lake shores, where the forest met the lake, you could find elf circles. They were round places where the grass had been flattened like a floor. Elves had danced there. By Lake Tisnaren, I have seen one of those. It could be dangerous and one could become ill if one had trodden over such a place or if one destroyed anything there.\n\nIf a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.Taylor 2014.\n\nElves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale Little Rosa and Long Leda, an elvish woman (älvakvinna) arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the subterraneans.\n\nIn ballads \n\nElves have a prominent place in a number of closely related ballads which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period.  Many of these ballads are first attested in Karen Brahes Folio, a Danish manuscript from the 1570s, but they circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain. Because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves, even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage. They have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. Some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture.Taylor 2014, 264-66.\n\nThe ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and human(-like) beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.\n\nAs causes of illness \n\nIn folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often play the role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.Olrik 1915–30.\n\nIn order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects.The article [http://runeberg.org/nfba/0313.html Alfkors] in Nordisk familjebok (1904). It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.\n\nModern continuations \n\nIn Iceland, expression of belief in the huldufólk (\"hidden people\"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief. A 2006 and 2007 study by the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts, a result similar to a 1974 survey by Erlendur Haraldsson. The lead researcher of the 2006–2007 study, Terry Gunnell, stated: \"Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations\". Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, \"narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. The elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer.\"Hafstein 2000, quoting p. 93. Elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary Icelandic literature.Hall 2015.\n\nFolk-stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.Tangherlini 1995, 34; cf. Ingwersen 1995, 78-79, 81.\n\nPost-medieval elite and popular culture\n\nEarly modern elite culture \n\nEarly modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.Taylor 2014.\n\nElves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of Elizabethan England. Here Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene (1590–) used fairy and elf interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the Elfe and Elfin kynd, claiming that they were created by Prometheus. Likewise, William Shakespeare, in a speech in Romeo and Juliet (1592) has an \"elf-lock\" (tangled hair) being caused Queen Mab, who is referred to as \"the fairies' midwife\".; \"Rom. & Jul. I, iv, 90 Elf-locks\" is the oldest example of the use of the phrase given by the OED. Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and etherial. The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of elf and fairy for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves, collected in the modern period.Tolkien 1969 [1947], 4-7.\n\nThe Romantic movement \n\nEarly modern English notions of elves became influential in eighteenth-century Germany. The Modern German Elf (m) and Elfe (f) was introduced as a loan-word from English in the 1740s.(Stallybrass tr.)  and was prominent in Christoph Martin Wieland's 1764 translation of A Midsummer Night's Dream.\"Die aufnahme des Wortes knüpft an Wielands Übersetzung von Shakespeares Sommernachtstraum 1764 und and Herders Voklslieder 1774 (Werke 25, 42) an;\n\nAs German Romanticism got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected Elf as a recent Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form Elb (plural Elbe or Elben).Grimm and Grimm 1854–1954, s.v. Elb. In the same vein, Johann Gottfried Herder translated the Danish ballad Elveskud in his 1778 collection of folk songs, ', as \"\" (\"The Erl-king's Daughter\"; it appears that Herder introduced the term Erlkönig into German through a mis-Germanisation of the Danish word for elf). This in turn inspired Goethe's poem Der Erlkönig. Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.Taylor 2014, 119-35.\n\nIn Scandinavia too, in the nineteenth century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called \"elves\" (älvor in modern Swedish, alfer in Danish, álfar in Icelandic), although the more formal translation in Danish is feer. Thus, the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has \"wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet\". Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the huldra in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.Erixon 1961, 34.\n\nEnglish and German literary traditions both influenced the British Victorian image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale Princess Nobody (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Die Wichtelmänner (literally, \"the little men\"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though Wichtelmänner are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as The Elves and the Shoemaker. This shows how the meanings of elf had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories. In his turn, J. R. R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form Elb in translations of his works, as recorded in his Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings (1967). Elb, Elben was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of The Lord of the Rings, repopularising the form in German.Hall 2014.\n\nModern popular culture \n\nChristmas elf \n\nWith industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.Hall 2014.\n\nAs American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (widely known as \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\") characterized St Nicholas himself as \"a right jolly old elf\". However, it was his little helpers, inspired partly by folktales like The Elves and the Shoemaker, who became known as \"Santa's elves\"; the processes through which this came about are not well understood, but one key figure was a Christmas-related publication by the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast.Hall 2014. Thus in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, the modern children's folklore of Santa Claus typically includes small, nimble, green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats, as Santa's helpers. They make the toys in a workshop located in the North Pole.Ressell W. Belk, 'A Child's Christmas in America: Santa Claus as Deity, Consumption as Religion', The Journal of American Culture, 10.1 (Spring 1987), 87–100 (p. 89). DOI: 10.1111/j.1542-734X.1987.1001_87.x. The role of elves as Santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie Elf.\n\nFantasy fiction \n\nThe fantasy genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth-century Romanticism, in which nineteenth-century scholars such as Andrew Lang and the Grimm brothers collected fairy-stories from folklore and in some cases retold them freely.Bergman 2011.\n\nA pioneering work of the fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth played a central role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.Bergman 2011.\n\nIn works where elves are the main characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders.Bergman 2011. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games,Cooper 2016, 97-99. or to influence gender-norms through literature.Bergman 2011, 215-29.\n\nEquivalents in non-Germanic traditions \n\nBeliefs in human-like supernatural beings are widespread in human cultures, and many such beings may be referred to as elves in English.\nEurope \n\nElf-like beings appear to have been a common characteristic within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The equivalent term in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.\n\nAsia \n\nIn Japan, the closest comparison are called , having magical or mysterious abilities. They can also be called , , or . Yōkai range from the malevolent to the mischievous, but occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them.\n\nKhmer culture in Cambodia includes the Mrenh kongveal, elf-like beings associated with guarding animals.\n\nFootnotes \n\nCitations",

    "aggregatedText" : "An elf (plural: elves) is a type of human-shaped supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.For discussion of a previous formulation of this sentence, see Ármann Jakobsson 2015. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.\n\nThe word elf is found throughout the Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'. Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by Christians, in Old and Middle English, medieval German, and Old Norse. These associate elves variously with the gods of Norse mythology, with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction. \n\nAfter the medieval period, the word elf tended to become less common throughout the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc (\"dwarf\") in German and huldra (\"hidden being\") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French into all the Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued to be associated with causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.\n\nFrom this Romanticist elite culture came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The \"Christmas elves\" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien; these re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and human-like beings. Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games and thereby continue to have a role in shaping people's understandings of their own real-life identities.\n\nRelationship to Christian cosmologies \n\nRecent scholars have emphasised, in the words of Ármann Jakobsson, that:the time has come to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.2006, 230–31; cf. Shippey 2005; Hall 2007, 16–17; Gunnell 2007.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.\n\nThere is no doubt that beliefs about elves have their origins before the conversion to Christianity and associated Christianization of north-west Europe. For this reason, belief in elves has, from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled \"pagan\" and a \"superstition\". However, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians (whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of Germanic-speakers' Christian culture and not merely relic of their pre-Christian religion. Accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and Christian cosmology has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.Jolly 1996; Shippey 2005; Green 2016.\n\nHistorically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology, all of which are found widely across time and space:\n\n* Identifying elves with the demons of Judaeo-Christian-Mediterranean tradition.e.g.  For example:\n** In English-language material: in the Royal Prayer Book from c. 900, elf appears as a gloss for \"Satan\".Hall 2007, 71–72. In the late-fourteenth-century Wife of Bath’s Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer equates male elves with incubi (demons which rape sleeping women).Hall 2007, 162. In the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials, witnesses' descriptions of encounters with elves were often interpreted by prosecutors as encounters with the Devil.Hall 2005, 30–32.\n** In medieval Scandinavia, Snorri Sturluson wrote in his Prose Edda of ljósálfar and døkkálfar ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ljósálfar living in the heavens and the døkkálfar under the earth. The consensus of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.Shippey 2005, 180–81; Hall 2007, 23–26; Gunnell 2007, 127–28; Tolley 2009, I 220.\n** Elves appear as demonic forces widely in medieval and early modern English, German, and Scandinavian prayers.Hall 2007, 69–74, 106 n. 48 and 122 on English evidence; Hall 2007, 98 fn 10 and Schulz 2000, 62–85 on German evidence; Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54–58 on Icelandic evidence.\n* Viewing elves as being more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology.e.g. Hall 2007, 172–75. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not explicitly try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, that may or may not be Christian.Shippey 2005, 161–68; Alver and Selberg 1987. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert the dominance of the Church.Ingwersen 1995, 83–89.\n* Integrating elves into Christian cosmology without identifying them as demons.e.g. Shippey 2005. The most striking examples are serious theological treatises: the Icelandic Tíðfordrif (1644) by Jón Guðmundsson lærði or, in Scotland, Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1691). This approach also appears in the Old English poem Beowulf, which lists elves among the races springing from Cain's murder of Abel.Hall 2007, 69–74. The late thirteenth-century South English Legendary and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God, and were banished by God to earth rather than hell. One famous Icelandic folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve.Hall 2007, 75; Shippey 2005, 174, 185–86.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe English word elf is from the Old English word most often attested as ælf (whose plural would have been *ælfe). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form elf during the Middle English period.Hall 2007, 176–81. During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ælfen, putatively from common Germanic *ɑlβ(i)innjō), but during the Middle English period the word elf came routinely to include female beings.Hall 2007, 75–88, 157–66.\n\nThe main medieval Germanic cognates (words of a common origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside the feminine elbe).Hall 2007, 5. These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.Hall 2007, 5, 176–77.\n\nGermanic *ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z is generally agreed to be cognate with the Latin albus ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ailbhín ('flock'); Albanian elb ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic álpt. These all come from an Indo-European base *albh-, and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant \"white person\", perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar, suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called \"the white people\" because they were regarded as beautiful.Hall 2007, 54–55.\n\nA completely different etymology, making elf cognate with the Rbhus, semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by Kuhn, in 1855.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nwvRTAAAAcAAJ&pgPA110 Kuhn 1855, 110]; [https://books.google.com/books?id\nfV8SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA163 Schrader 1890, 163]. In this case, *ɑlβi-z connotes the meaning, \"skillful, inventive, clever\", and is cognate with Latin labor, in the sense of \"creative work\". While often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.Hall 2007, 54–55 fn. 1.\n\nElves in proper names \n\nThroughout the medieval Germanic languages, elf was one of the nouns that was used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.Hall 2007, 56.\n\nPersonal names provide the only evidence for elf in Gothic, which must have had the word *albs (plural *albeis). The most famous name of this kind is Alboin. Old English names in elf- include the cognate of Alboin Ælfwine (literally \"elf-friend\", m.), Ælfric (\"elf-powerful\", m.), Ælfweard (\"elf-guardian\", m.), and Ælfwaru (\"elf-care\", f.). A widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred (Old English Ælfrēd, \"elf-advice\"). Also surviving are the English surname Elgar (Ælfgar, \"elf-spear\") and the name of St Alphege (Ælfhēah, \"elf-high\"). German examples are Alberich, Alphart and Alphere (father of Walter of Aquitaine)Paul 1900, 268. and Icelandic examples include Álfhildur. These names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Of the many words for supernatural beings in Germanic languages, the only ones used in personal names are elf and words denoting pagan gods, suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods.Hall 2007, 55–62.\n\nIn later Old Icelandic, alfr (\"elf\") and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been *Aþa(l)wulfaz both coincidentally became álfr~Álfr.De Vreis 1962, s.v. Álfr.\n\nElves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden (\"elves' hill\", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill (\"Elves' hill\", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley (\"elves' valley\", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.Hall 2007, 64–66\n\nElves in medieval texts and post-medieval folk-belief \n\nMedieval English-language sources \n\nElves as causes of illness \n\nThe earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any Germanic language are from Anglo-Saxon England. Medieval English evidence has, therefore, attracted quite extensive research and debate.Jolly 1996.Shippey 2005.Hall 2007.Green 2016. In Old English, elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and livestock with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm Wið færstice (\"against a stabbing pain\"), from the tenth-century compilation Lacnunga, but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century Bald's Leechbook and Leechbook III. This tradition continues into later English-language traditions too: elves continue to appear in Middle English medical texts.Hall 2007, 88–89, 141; Green 2003; Hall 2006. \n\nBeliefs in elves causing illness remained prominent in early modern Scotland, where elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people.Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005. Thus, elves were often mentioned in the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials: many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves.Purkiss 2000, 85-115; Henderson and Cowan 2001; Hall 2005.Hall 2007, 112–15. Throughout these sources, elves are sometimes associated with the succuba-like supernatural being called the mare.Hall 2007, 124–26, 128–29, 136–37, 156. \n\nWhile they may have been thought to cause disease with magical weapons, elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English sīden and sīdsa, cognate with Old Norse seiðr, and also paralleled in the Old Irish Serglige Con Culainn.Hall 2007, 119–56; Tolley 2009, I 221.  By the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy.Hall 2007, 88–89, 141; Green 2003; Hall 2006.\n\n\"Elf-shot\" \n\nIn one or two Old English medical texts, elves might be envisaged as inflicting illness with projectiles. In the twentieth century, scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as \"elf-shot\", but work from the 1990s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves being thought to cause illness in this way is slender;Hall 2007, 96–118. debate about its significance is ongoing.Tolley 2009, I 220. \n\nThe noun elf-shot is actually first attested in a Scots poem, \"Rowlis Cursing\", from around 1500, where \"elf schot\" is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken-thieves.Hall 2005b, 23. The term may not always have denoted an actual projectile: shot could mean \"a sharp pain\" as well as \"projectile\". But in early modern Scotland elf-schot and other terms like elf-arrowhead are sometimes used of neolithic arrow-heads, apparently thought to have been made by elves. In a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrrow-heads were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged that witches (and perhaps elves) used them to injure people and cattle.Hall 2005. Compare with the following excerpt from a 1749–50 ode by William Collins:\n\nThere every herd, by sad experience, knows\nHow, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly,\nWhen the sick ewe her summer food forgoes,\nOr, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie.Carlyle 1788, i 68, stanza II. 1749 date of composition is given on p. 63.\n\nSize, appearance, and sexuality \n\nBecause of elves' association with illness, in the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. This was encouraged by the idea that \"elf-shot\" is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection.Grattan and Singer 1952, frontispiece. However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons.Jolly 1998. Rather, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish Aos Sí, were regarded as people.Shippey 2005, 168–76; Hall 2007, esp. 172–75. \n\nLike words for gods and men, the word elf is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not. Just as álfar are associated with Æsir in Old Norse, the Old English Wið færstice associates elves with ēse; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods.Hall 2007, 35–63. In Old English, the plural ylfe (attested in Beowulf) is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people.Huld 1998; Hall 2007, 62–63; Tolley 2009, I 209. As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word ælf and its feminine derivative ælbinne were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs. This fits well with the word ælfscȳne, which meant \"elf-beautiful\" and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines Sarah and Judith.Hall 2007, 75–95. \n\nLikewise, in Middle English and early modern Scottish evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings.Hall 2007, 157–66; Shippey 2005, 172–76. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly with the idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material.Shippey 2005, 175–76; Hall 2007, 130–48; Green 2016, 76–109. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.Green 2016, 110–46.\n\nDecline in the use of the word elf \n\nBy the end of the medieval period, elf was increasingly being supplanted by the French loan-word fairy.Hall 2005, 20. An example is Geoffrey Chaucer's satirical tale Sir Thopas, where the title character sets out in quest of the \"elf-queen\", who dwells in the \"countree of the Faerie\".\n\nOld Norse texts \n\nMythological texts \n\nEvidence for elf-beliefs in medieval Scandinavia outside Iceland is very sparse, but the Icelandic evidence is uniquely rich. For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, which talks about svartálfar, dökkálfar and ljósálfar (\"black elves\", \"dark elves\", and \"light elves\"). However, these words are only attested in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves, demons, and angels, partly showing Snorri's \"paganisation\" of a Christian cosmology learned from the Elucidarius, a popular digest of Christian thought.\n\nScholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is Völundr, the protagonist of Völundarkviða.Dumézil 1973, 3. However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase Æsir ok Álfar ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the Æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and Æsir were one and the same.Hall 2007, 34–39Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 49–50. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wið færsticeHall 2007, 35–63 and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word elf is used in the same way as words for gods.Hall 2007, 28–32. Sigvatr Þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue Austrfaravísur, composed around 1020, mentions an álfablót (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden.Hall 2007, 30–31. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants.Hall 2007, 31–34, 42, 47–53. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.Hall 2007, 32–33.\n\nThere are hints that the god Freyr was associated with elves. In particular, Álfheimr (literally \"elf-world\") is mentioned as being given to Freyr in Grímnismál. Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the Vanir. However, the term Vanir is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages. Given the link between Freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that álfar and Vanir are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings.Simek 2010; Hall 27, 35–37; Frog and Roper 2011. However, this is not uniformly accepted.Tolley 2009, I 210–17.\n\nA kenning (poetic metaphor) for the sun, álfröðull (literally \"elf disc\"), is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun.; .\n\nAlthough the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr is described as one of the elves in Völundarkviða.Ármann Jakobsson 2006; Hall 2007, 39–47. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 50-52. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.Hall 2007, 133–34.\n\nOther sources \n\nThe appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre. The Sagas of Icelanders, Bishops' Sagas, and Contemporary sagas, whose portrayal of the supernatural is generally restrained, rarely mention álfar, and then only in passing.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231. But although limited, these texts provide some of the best evidence for the presence of elves in everyday beliefs in medieval Scandinavia. They include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in 1168 (in Sturlunga saga); mention of an álfablót (\"elves' sacrifice\") in Kormáks saga; and the existence of the euphemism ganga álfrek ('go to drive away the elves') for \"going to the toilet\" in Eyrbyggja saga.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231; Tolley 2009, I 217–18.\n\nThe Kings' sagas include a rather elliptical but widely studied account of an early Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called Ólafr Geirstaðaálfr ('Ólafr the elf of Geirstaðir'), and a demonic elf at the beginning of Norna-Gests þáttr.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 231–32; Hall 2007, 26–27; Tolley 2009, I 218–19.\n\nThe legendary sagas tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of Álfheimr is found in Heimskringla while Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men.[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/viking/001_02.php The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son] (Old Norse original: [http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/thorstei.htm Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]). Chapter 1. Ashman Rowe 2010, 11-12. According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The Þiðreks saga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, Völsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied.Ármann Jakobsson 2006, 232. The relatively few mentions of elves in the Chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 52–54.\n\nBoth Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts, sometimes in Latin and sometimes in the form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.Hall 2007, 132–33.Haukur Þorgeirsson 2011, 54–58.Simek 2011.\n\nMedieval and early modern German texts \n\nThe Old High German word alp is attested only in a small number of glosses. It is defined by the Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch as a \"nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the mare he messes around with women\".'Naturgott oder -dämon, den Faunen der antiken Mythologie gleichgesetzt ... er gilt als gespenstisches, heimtückisches Wesen ... als Nachtmahr spielt er den Frauen mit'; Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v. alb. Accordingly, the German word Alpdruck (literally \"elf-oppression\") means \"nightmare\". There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.Edwards 1994.\n\nIn a similar vein, elves are in Middle German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people \"in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: die elben/der alp trieget mich (\"the elves/elf are/is deceiving me\").Edwards 1994, 16–17, at 17. The same pattern holds in Early Modern German.(Stallybrass tr.) In Lexer's Middle High German dictionary under [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/Lexer/?sigleLexer&mode\nVernetzung&lemidLA00984 alp, alb] is an example: Pf.  arzb. 2 14b\n  (): \"Swen der alp triuget, rouchet er sich mit der verbena, ime enwirret als pald niht;\" meaning: 'When an alp deceives you, fumigate yourself with verbena and the confusion will soon be gone'. The editor glosses alp here as \"malicious, teasing spirit\" ()  This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth-century Heinrich von Morungen's fifth Minnesang begins \"Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man / Sô bin ich von grôzer lieber entsên\" (\"full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love\").Edwards 1994, 13. Elbe was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.Edwards 1994, 17.\n\nIn later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe.Hall 2007, 125–26. Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.Edwards 1994, 21–22.\n\nAs in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. It seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves ().Motz 1983, esp. 23–66. Thus, some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves. In particular, nineteenth-century scholars tended to think that the dwarf Alberich, whose name etymologically means \"elf-powerful\", was influenced by early traditions of elves.Weston 1903, 144.(Stallybrass tr.) \n\nElves in post-medieval folklore \n\nEngland \n\nFrom around the Late Middle Ages, the word elf began to be used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy;Hall 2005, 20–21. in elite art and literature, at least, it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.Bergman 2011, 62-74.\n\nHowever, in Scotland and parts of northern England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales,Henderson and Cowan 2001. There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as Thomas the Rhymer, where a man meets a female elf; Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.Taylor 2014, 199-251.\n\nScandinavia \n\nTerminology\n\nIn Scandinavian folklore, a diverse array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might be thought of as elves and which might partly originate in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further complicated by the fact that when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.Olrik 1915–30\n\nAppearance and behaviour\n\nThe elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones. The Swedish älvor were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king.For the Swedish belief in älvor see mainly . Chapter: \"Scandinavia: Elves\" \n\nThe elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a circle where they had danced, which were called älvdanser (elf dances) or älvringar (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. Typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle. In the words of the local historian Anne Marie Hellström:\n\n...on lake shores, where the forest met the lake, you could find elf circles. They were round places where the grass had been flattened like a floor. Elves had danced there. By Lake Tisnaren, I have seen one of those. It could be dangerous and one could become ill if one had trodden over such a place or if one destroyed anything there.\n\nIf a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.Taylor 2014.\n\nElves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale Little Rosa and Long Leda, an elvish woman (älvakvinna) arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the subterraneans.\n\nIn ballads \n\nElves have a prominent place in a number of closely related ballads which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period.  Many of these ballads are first attested in Karen Brahes Folio, a Danish manuscript from the 1570s, but they circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain. Because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves, even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage. They have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. Some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture.Taylor 2014, 264-66.\n\nThe ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and human(-like) beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.\n\nAs causes of illness \n\nIn folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often play the role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.Olrik 1915–30.\n\nIn order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects.The article [http://runeberg.org/nfba/0313.html Alfkors] in Nordisk familjebok (1904). It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.\n\nModern continuations \n\nIn Iceland, expression of belief in the huldufólk (\"hidden people\"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief. A 2006 and 2007 study by the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts, a result similar to a 1974 survey by Erlendur Haraldsson. The lead researcher of the 2006–2007 study, Terry Gunnell, stated: \"Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations\". Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, \"narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. The elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer.\"Hafstein 2000, quoting p. 93. Elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary Icelandic literature.Hall 2015.\n\nFolk-stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.Tangherlini 1995, 34; cf. Ingwersen 1995, 78-79, 81.\n\nPost-medieval elite and popular culture\n\nEarly modern elite culture \n\nEarly modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.Taylor 2014.\n\nElves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of Elizabethan England. Here Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene (1590–) used fairy and elf interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the Elfe and Elfin kynd, claiming that they were created by Prometheus. Likewise, William Shakespeare, in a speech in Romeo and Juliet (1592) has an \"elf-lock\" (tangled hair) being caused Queen Mab, who is referred to as \"the fairies' midwife\".; \"Rom. & Jul. I, iv, 90 Elf-locks\" is the oldest example of the use of the phrase given by the OED. Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and etherial. The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of elf and fairy for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves, collected in the modern period.Tolkien 1969 [1947], 4-7.\n\nThe Romantic movement \n\nEarly modern English notions of elves became influential in eighteenth-century Germany. The Modern German Elf (m) and Elfe (f) was introduced as a loan-word from English in the 1740s.(Stallybrass tr.)  and was prominent in Christoph Martin Wieland's 1764 translation of A Midsummer Night's Dream.\"Die aufnahme des Wortes knüpft an Wielands Übersetzung von Shakespeares Sommernachtstraum 1764 und and Herders Voklslieder 1774 (Werke 25, 42) an;\n\nAs German Romanticism got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected Elf as a recent Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form Elb (plural Elbe or Elben).Grimm and Grimm 1854–1954, s.v. Elb. In the same vein, Johann Gottfried Herder translated the Danish ballad Elveskud in his 1778 collection of folk songs, ', as \"\" (\"The Erl-king's Daughter\"; it appears that Herder introduced the term Erlkönig into German through a mis-Germanisation of the Danish word for elf). This in turn inspired Goethe's poem Der Erlkönig. Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.Taylor 2014, 119-35.\n\nIn Scandinavia too, in the nineteenth century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called \"elves\" (älvor in modern Swedish, alfer in Danish, álfar in Icelandic), although the more formal translation in Danish is feer. Thus, the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has \"wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet\". Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the huldra in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.Erixon 1961, 34.\n\nEnglish and German literary traditions both influenced the British Victorian image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale Princess Nobody (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Die Wichtelmänner (literally, \"the little men\"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though Wichtelmänner are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as The Elves and the Shoemaker. This shows how the meanings of elf had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories. In his turn, J. R. R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form Elb in translations of his works, as recorded in his Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings (1967). Elb, Elben was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of The Lord of the Rings, repopularising the form in German.Hall 2014.\n\nModern popular culture \n\nChristmas elf \n\nWith industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.Hall 2014.\n\nAs American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (widely known as \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\") characterized St Nicholas himself as \"a right jolly old elf\". However, it was his little helpers, inspired partly by folktales like The Elves and the Shoemaker, who became known as \"Santa's elves\"; the processes through which this came about are not well understood, but one key figure was a Christmas-related publication by the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast.Hall 2014. Thus in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, the modern children's folklore of Santa Claus typically includes small, nimble, green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats, as Santa's helpers. They make the toys in a workshop located in the North Pole.Ressell W. Belk, 'A Child's Christmas in America: Santa Claus as Deity, Consumption as Religion', The Journal of American Culture, 10.1 (Spring 1987), 87–100 (p. 89). DOI: 10.1111/j.1542-734X.1987.1001_87.x. The role of elves as Santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie Elf.\n\nFantasy fiction \n\nThe fantasy genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth-century Romanticism, in which nineteenth-century scholars such as Andrew Lang and the Grimm brothers collected fairy-stories from folklore and in some cases retold them freely.Bergman 2011.\n\nA pioneering work of the fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth played a central role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.Bergman 2011.\n\nIn works where elves are the main characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders.Bergman 2011. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games,Cooper 2016, 97-99. or to influence gender-norms through literature.Bergman 2011, 215-29.\n\nEquivalents in non-Germanic traditions \n\nBeliefs in human-like supernatural beings are widespread in human cultures, and many such beings may be referred to as elves in English.\nEurope \n\nElf-like beings appear to have been a common characteristic within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The equivalent term in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.\n\nAsia \n\nIn Japan, the closest comparison are called , having magical or mysterious abilities. They can also be called , , or . Yōkai range from the malevolent to the mischievous, but occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them.\n\nKhmer culture in Cambodia includes the Mrenh kongveal, elf-like beings associated with guarding animals.\n\nFootnotes \n\nCitations.
