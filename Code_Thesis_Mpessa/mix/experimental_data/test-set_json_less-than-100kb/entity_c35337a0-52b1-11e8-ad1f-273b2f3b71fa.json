He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and 4 being missing. Grünbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that I. Alexeyev of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Grünbaum was unable to verify this at the time.\n* 2006: George Olshevsky, in his manuscript Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs, along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of uniform 4-polytopes in 4-space).\n\nOnly 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:\n* three of the five Platonic solids,\n* six of the thirteen Archimedean solids, and\n* five of the infinite family of prisms.\n\nNames \n\nThis set can be called the regular and semiregular honeycombs. It has been called the Archimedean honeycombs by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called Archimedean solids. Recently Conway has suggested naming the set as the Architectonic tessellations and the dual honeycombs as the Catoptric tessellations.\n\nThe individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by Norman Johnson. (Some of the terms used below are defined in Uniform 4-polytope#Geometric derivations for 46 nonprismatic Wythoffian uniform 4-polytopes)\n\nFor cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from Andreini (1-22), Williams(1-2,9-19), Johnson (11-19, 21-25, 31-34, 41-49, 51-52, 61-65), and Grünbaum(1-28). Coxeter uses δ4 for a cubic honeycomb, hδ4 for an alternated cubic honeycomb, qδ4 for a quarter cubic honeycomb, with subscripts for other forms based on the ring patterns of the Coxeter diagram.\n\nCompact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families) \n\nThe fundamental infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:\n# The {\\tilde{C}}_3, [4,3,4], cubic,  (8 unique forms plus one alternation)\n# The {\\tilde{B}}_3, [4,31,1], alternated cubic,  (11 forms, 3 new)\n# The {\\tilde{A}}_3 cyclic group, [(3,3,3,3)] or [3[4]],  (5 forms, one new)\n\nThere is a correspondence between all three families. Removing one mirror from {\\tilde{C}}_3 produces {\\tilde{B}}_3, and removing one mirror from {\\tilde{B}}_3 produces {\\tilde{A}}_3. This allows multiple constructions of the same honeycombs. If cells are colored based on unique positions within each Wythoff construction, these different symmetries can be shown.\n\nIn addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with elongation and gyration operations.\n\nThe total unique honeycombs above are 18.\n\nThe prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:\n# The {\\tilde{C}}_2×{\\tilde{I}}_1, [4,4,2,∞] prismatic group,  (2 new forms)\n# The {\\tilde{H}}_2×{\\tilde{I}}_1, [6,3,2,∞] prismatic group,  (7 unique forms)\n# The {\\tilde{A}}_2×{\\tilde{I}}_1, [(3,3,3),2,∞] prismatic group,  (No new forms)\n# The {\\tilde{I}}_1×{\\tilde{I}}_1×{\\tilde{I}}_1, [∞,2,∞,2,∞] prismatic group,  (These all become a cubic honeycomb)\n\nIn addition there is one special elongated form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.\n\nThe total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.\n\nCombining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.\n\nThe C~3, [4,3,4] group (cubic) \n\nThe regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the runcinated cubic honeycomb, is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.) The reflectional symmetry is the affine Coxeter group [4,3,4]. There are four index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1+,4,3,4], [(4,3,4,2+)], [4,3+,4], and [4,3,4]+, with the first two generated repeated forms, and the last two are nonuniform.\n\nB~3, [4,31,1] group \n\nThe {\\tilde{B}}_3, [4,3] group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs. There are 3 index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1+,4,31,1], [4,(31,1)+], and [4,31,1]+. The first generates repeated honeycomb, and the last two are nonuniform but included for completeness.\n\nThe honeycombs from this group are called alternated cubic because the first form can be seen as a cubic honeycomb with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.\n\nNodes are indexed left to right as 0,1,0',3 with 0' being below and interchangeable with 0. The alternate cubic names given are based on this ordering.\n\nA~3, [3[4])] group \n\nThere are 5 forms[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Necklace.html], [http://oeis.org/A000029 A000029] 6-1 cases, skipping one with zero marks constructed from the {\\tilde{A}}_3, [3[4]] Coxeter group, of which only the quarter cubic honeycomb is unique. There is one index 2 subgroup [3[4]]+ which generates the snub form, which is not uniform, but included for completeness.\n\nNonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated) \n\nThree more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (gyration) and/or inserting a layer of prisms (elongation).\n\nThe elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike.  In the elongated form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other.  In the gyroelongated form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.\n\nThe gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.\n\nPrismatic stacks \n\nEleven prismatic tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven uniform plane tilings, shown below, in parallel layers.  (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.)  The vertex figure of each is an irregular bipyramid whose faces are isosceles triangles.\n\nThe C~2×I~1(∞), [4,4,2,∞], prismatic group \n\nThere are only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.\n\nThe G~2xI~1(∞), [6,3,2,∞] prismatic group \n\nEnumeration of Wythoff forms \n\nAll nonprismatic Wythoff constructions by Coxeter groups are given below, along with their alternations. Uniform solutions are indexed with Branko Grünbaum's listing. Green backgrounds are shown on repeated honeycombs, with the relations are expressed in the extended symmetry diagrams.\n\nExamples\n\nAll 28 of these tessellations are found in crystal arrangements.\n\nThe alternated cubic honeycomb is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic close-packing of spheres. The space-filling truss of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by Alexander Graham Bell and independently re-discovered by Buckminster Fuller (who called it the octet truss and patented it in the 1940s).\n[http://tabletoptelephone.com/~hopspage/Fuller.html]\n[http://members.cruzio.com/~devarco/energy.htm]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20050113123708/http://www.n55.dk/manuals/DISCUSSIONS/OTHER_TEXTS/CM_TEXT.html]\n[http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-2.html]. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.\n\nFrieze forms \n\nIf cells are allowed to be uniform tilings, more uniform honeycombs can be defined:\n\nFamilies:\n*{\\tilde{C}}_2xA_1: [4,4,2]  Cubic slab honeycombs (3 forms)\n*{\\tilde{G}}_2xA_1: [6,3,2]  Tri-hexagonal slab honeycombs (8 forms)\n* {\\tilde{A}}_2xA_1: [(3,3,3),2]  Triangular slab honeycombs (No new forms)\n*{\\tilde{I}}_1xA_1xA_1: [∞,2,2]  =  Cubic column honeycombs (1 form)\n*I_2(p)x{\\tilde{I}}_1: [p,2,∞]  Polygonal column honeycombs\n* {\\tilde{C}}_2x{\\tilde{C}}_2xA_1: [∞,2,∞,2] [4,4,2] -  \n  (Same as cubic slab honeycomb family)\n\nScaliform honeycomb\n\nA scaliform honeycomb is vertex-transitive, like a uniform honeycomb, with regular polygon faces while cells and higher elements are only required to be orbiforms, equilateral, with their vertices lying on hyperspheres. For 3D honeycombs, this allows a subset of Johnson solids along with the uniform polyhedra. Some scaliforms can be generated by an alternation process, leaving, for example, pyramid and cupola gaps.http://bendwavy.org/klitzing/explain/polytope-tree.htm#scaliform\n\nHyperbolic forms \n\nThere are 9 Coxeter group families of compact uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by ring permutations of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams for each family.\n\nFrom these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:\n* [3,5,3] :  - 9 forms\n* [5,3,4] :  - 15 forms\n* [5,3,5] :  - 9 forms\n* [5,31,1] :  - 11 forms (7 overlap with [5,3,4] family, 4 are unique)\n* [(4,3,3,3)] :  - 9 forms\n* [(4,3,4,3)] :  - 6 forms\n* [(5,3,3,3)] :  - 9 forms\n* [(5,3,4,3)] :  - 9 forms\n* [(5,3,5,3)] :  - 6 forms\n\nThe full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of non-Wythoffian forms exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.\n\nParacompact hyperbolic forms \n\nThere are also 23 paracompact Coxeter groups of rank 4. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity:",
