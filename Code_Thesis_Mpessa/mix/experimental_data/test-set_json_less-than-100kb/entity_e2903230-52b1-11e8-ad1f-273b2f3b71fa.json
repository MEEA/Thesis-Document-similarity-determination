Singularities that are not so hidden are called naked. The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis was conceived by Roger Penrose in 1969 and posits that no naked singularities, other than the Big Bang singularity, exist in the universe.\n\nBasics\n\nSince the physical behavior of singularities is unknown, if singularities can be observed from the rest of spacetime, causality may break down, and physics may lose its predictive power. The issue cannot be avoided, since according to the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems, singularities are inevitable in physically reasonable situations. Still, in the absence of naked singularities, the universe, as described by the general theory of relativity, is deterministic  J.

Failure of the cosmic censorship hypothesis leads to the failure of determinism, because it is yet impossible to predict the behavior of spacetime in the causal future of a singularity. Cosmic censorship is not merely a problem of formal interest; some form of it is assumed whenever black hole event horizons are mentioned.\n\nThe hypothesis was first formulated by Roger Penrose in 1969, and it is not stated in a completely formal way. In a sense it is more of a research program proposal: part of the research is to find a proper formal statement that is physically reasonable and that can be proved to be true or false (and that is sufficiently general to be interesting).[http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/nyt_bet_story.html A Bet on a Cosmic Scale, And a Concession, Sort Of (New York Times, February 12, 1997)]  Because the statement is not a strictly formal one, there is sufficient latitude for (at least) two independent formulations, a weak form, and a strong form.\n\nWeak and strong cosmic censorship hypothesis \n\nThe weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis are two conjectures concerned with the global geometry of spacetimes.\n\nThe weak cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts there can be no singularity visible from future null infinity. In other words, singularities need to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole. Mathematically, the conjecture states that, for generic initial data, the maximal Cauchy development possesses a complete future null infinity.\n\nThe strong cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts that, generically, general relativity is a deterministic theory, in the same sense that classical mechanics is a deterministic theory. In other words, the classical fate of all observers should be predictable from the initial data. Mathematically, the conjecture states that the maximal Cauchy development of generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data is locally inextendible as a regular Lorentzian manifold.\n\nThe two conjectures are mathematically independent, as there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is valid but strong cosmic censorship is violated and, conversely, there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is violated but strong cosmic censorship is valid.\n\nExample\n\nThe Kerr metric, corresponding to a black hole of mass M and angular momentum J, can be used to derive the effective potential for particle orbits restricted to the equator (as defined by rotation).

This could be done by somehow imparting an angular momentum upon the black hole, making it exceed the critical value (assume it starts infinitesimally below it).  This could be done by sending a particle of angular momentum l = 2Me.  Because this particle has angular momentum, it can only be captured by the black hole if the maximum potential of the black hole is less than (e^2-1)/2.\n\nSolving the above effective potential equation for the maximum under the given conditions results in a maximum potential of exactly (e^2-1)/2!  Testing other values shows that no particle with enough angular momentum to violate the censorship conjecture would be able to enter the black hole, because they have too much angular momentum to fall in.\n\nProblems with the concept\n\nThere are a number of difficulties in formalizing the hypothesis:\n\n* There are technical difficulties with properly formalizing the notion of a singularity.\n* It is not difficult to construct spacetimes which have naked singularities, but which are not \"physically reasonable\"; the canonical example of such a spacetime is perhaps the \"superextremal\" M Reissner-Nordström solution, which contains a singularity at r=0 that is not surrounded by a horizon. A formal statement needs some set of hypotheses which exclude these situations.\n* Caustics may occur in simple models of gravitational collapse, and can appear to lead to singularities.
