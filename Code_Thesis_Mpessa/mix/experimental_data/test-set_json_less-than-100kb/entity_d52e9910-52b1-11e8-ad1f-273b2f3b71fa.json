  "textBody" : "At 475440 km2, Cameroon is the world's 54th largest country.Demographic Yearbook 1. It is slightly larger than the nation of Sweden and state of California. It is comparable in size to Papua New Guinea. Cameroon's landmass is 472710 km2, with 2730 km2 of water.\n\nThe country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.\n\nCameroon is sometimes described as \"Africa in miniature\" because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savanna grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.\n\nNatural regions\n\nCameroon's coastal plain extends 10 to inland from the Gulf of Guinea (part of the Atlantic Ocean) to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of Mount Cameroon reaches almost to the sea.  The plain is densely forested including areas of Central African mangroves especially around Douala and in the estuary of the Cross River on the border with Nigeria.\n\nThe low South Cameroon Plateau, rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of 1500 to. It is less humid than the coast.\n\nIn western Cameroon is an irregular  chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus that extends from Mount Cameroon almost to Lake Chad at the northern tip of the country. This region includes the Bamenda, Bamiléké, and Mambilla highlands. It also contains some of the country's most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon. This area of tropical forest has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion with Mount Cameroon considered separately because as an active volcano it has a distinct environment from the other mountains.\n\nFrom the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged Adamaoua (Adamawa) highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is 3400 ft.\n\nThe southern savanna plain extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures has been included as part of the East Sudanian savanna ecoregion.\n\nClimate \n\n \nThe climate varies with terrain, from tropical along the coast to semiarid and hot in the north.\nExceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example, Debundscha, at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of 405 in.[https://archive.is/20120525195312/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes]. Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation, National Climatic Data Center. August 9, 2004. Last accessed November 7, 2006.\n\nRivers\n\nThe country has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers flow southwestward or westward directly to the Gulf of Guinea — the Wouri, and lesser Dibamba, Bimbia and Mungo to the Cameroon estuary near Douala; Sanaga, Nyong, and Ntem further south along the coast; Akwayafe and Manyu (which joins Nigerian Cross), and the lesser Ndian and Meme in the north of coast. The Dja and Kadeï, however, drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the Benoué River (Benue) runs north and west, eventually into the Niger, while the Logone River flows northward into Lake Chad.\n\nSome of the borders of Cameroon follow rivers, including the Aïna, Akwayafe, and Ntem or Campo.\n\nData\n\nLocation:\nCentral Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria\n\nGeographic coordinates:\n\nMap references:\nAfrica\n\nArea:\ntotal:\n\nland:\n\nwater:\n\nArea - comparative:\nslightly larger than California or Sweden\n\nLand boundaries:\ntotal:\n5,018 km\nborder countries:\nCentral African Republic 901 km, Chad 1,116 km, Republic of the Congo 494 km, Equatorial Guinea 183 km, Gabon 349 km, Nigeria 1,975 km\n\nCoastline:\n402 km\n\nMaritime claims:\nterritorial sea:\n12 nmi\n\nTerrain:\ndiverse, with coastal plain in southwest, dissected plateau in center, mountains in west, plains in north\n\nElevation extremes:\nlowest point:\nAtlantic Ocean 0 m\nhighest point:\nFako (on.
