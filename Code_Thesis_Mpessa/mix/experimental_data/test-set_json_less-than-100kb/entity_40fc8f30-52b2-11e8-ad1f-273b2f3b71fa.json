  "textBody" : "Macaroni is a variety of dry pasta traditionally shaped and produced in various shapes and sizes.   Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes, but like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite ends of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine.\n\nIn North America, the word \"macaroni\" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy, the noun maccheroni refers to straight, tubular, square-ended pasta corta (\"short-length pasta\"). Maccheroni may also refer to long pasta dishes such as maccheroni alla chitarra and frittata di maccheroni, which are prepared with long pasta like spaghetti.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name comes from Italian maccheroni, plural form of maccherone.Oxford Dictionary, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaroni Macaroni]Il Devoto-Oli. Vocabolario della lingua italiana, edited by Luca Serianni and Maurizio Trifone, Le Monnier. The many variants sometimes differ from each other because of the texture of each pasta: rigatoni and tortiglioni, for example, have ridges down their lengths, while chifferi, lumache, lumaconi, pipe, pipette, etc. refer to elbow-shaped pasta similar to macaroni in North American culture.\n\nHowever, the product as well as the name derives from the ancient Greek \"Macaria\".

In Hong Kong's cha chaan teng (\"tea restaurants\") and Southeast Asia's kopi tiam (\"coffee shops\"), macaroni are cooked in water and then rinsed to remove starch, and served in clear broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes.
