  "textBody" : "Eta (uppercase , lowercase ;  ē̂ta or  ita) is the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet. Originally denoting  a consonant /h/, its sound value in the classical Attic dialect of Ancient Greek was a long vowel Open-mid front unrounded vowel|, raised to in hellenistic Greek, a process known as iotacism.\n\nIn the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 8. It was derived from the Phoenician letter heth . Letters that arose from eta include the Latin H and the Cyrillic letter И.\n\nHistory\n\nConsonant h\n\nThe letter shape 'H' was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the sound /h/, a voiceless glottal fricative. In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets, which were based on the Euboean form of the Greek alphabet. This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter H.\n\nOther regional variants of the Greek alphabet (epichoric alphabets), in dialects that still preserved the sound /h/, employed various glyph shapes for consonantal heta side by side with the new vocalic eta for some time. \nIn the southern Italian colonies of Heracleia and Tarentum, the letter shape was reduced to a \"half-heta\" lacking the right vertical stem (Ͱ). From this sign later developed the sign for rough breathing or spiritus asper,  which brought back the marking of the  /h/ sound into the standardized post-classical (polytonic) orthography.[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_aitch.html Nick Nicholas (2003), \"Greek /h/\"] \nDionysius Thrax in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced heta (ἥτα), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating \"in the old days the letter Η served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans.\" \nAlfredus Hilgard (ed), \"In artis Dionysianae §6\" in Grammatici Graeci. Scholia in Dionysii Thracis Artem Grammaticam (1901), p. 486.\n\nLong e\n\nIn the East Ionic dialect, however, the sound /h/ disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long vowel, which later merged in East Ionic with  instead.\n\n In 403 BC, Athens took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the /h/ sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.\n\nItacism\n\nDuring the time of post-classical Koiné Greek, the sound represented by eta was raised and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called itacism after the new pronunciation of the letter name as ita instead of eta.\n\nItacism is continued into Modern Greek, where the letter name  is pronounced and represents the sound /i/ (a close front unrounded vowel). It shares this function with several other letters (ι, υ) and digraphs (ει, οι), which are all pronounced alike. This phenomenon at large is called iotacism.\n\nCyrillic script\n\nEta was also borrowed with the sound value of [i] into the Cyrillic script, where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter И.\n\nUses\n\nLetter\n\nIn Modern Greek the letter, pronounced, represents a close front unrounded vowel,. In Classical Greek, it represented a long open-mid front unrounded vowel,.\n\nSymbol\n\nUpper case\n\nThe upper-case letter Η is used as a symbol in textual criticism for the Alexandrian text-type (from Hesychius, its once-supposed editor).\n\nIn chemistry, the letter H as symbol of enthalpy sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from ἐνθάλπος, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin H for 'heat'.\n\nIn information theory the upper-case Greek letter H is used to represent the concept of entropy of a discrete random variable.\n\nLower case\n\nThe lower-case letter η is used as a symbol in:\n*Thermodynamics, the efficiency of a Carnot heat engine, or packing fraction.\n*Chemistry, the hapticity, or the number of atoms of a ligand attached to one coordination site of the metal in a coordination compound.
