  "textBody" : "Charles Proteus Steinmetz (born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz, April 9, 1865 – October 26, 1923) was a German-born American mathematician and electrical engineer and professor at Union College. He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry.\n\nEarly life\n\nSteinmetz was born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz on April 9, 1865 in Breslau, Province of Silesia, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz. He was baptized a Lutheran into the Evangelical Church of Prussia, the religion his ethnically-Jewish family nominally belonged to.[https://books.google.com/books?id70I5ZKOYW_QC&pg\nPT16&dqCharles+Steinmetz+lutheran&hl\nen&saX&ei\n9kNlVfXmMMfbsAThg4PADQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBw Credo: Unitarians and Universalists of Yesteryear Talk About Their Lives and ... - Don McEvoy - Google Books] Steinmetz suffered from dwarfism, hunchback, and hip dysplasia, as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes Gymnasium and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in mathematics and physics.\n\nFollowing the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the University of Breslau to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a socialist university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.\n\nSocialism and technocracy\n\nAs socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to Zürich in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to \"Charles\" in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name \"Proteus\" after a childhood epithet given to him by classmates. Proteus was a wise hunchbacked character from the Odyssey who knew many secrets, and Steinmetz felt the name suited him.\n\nCornell University Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist,Ronald R. Klein, Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist (Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology), 1992, . contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as the fact that he was in arrears with his tuition at the University of Breslau and that life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters was full of tension.\n\nDespite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a \"powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office\", and because \"only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today\".\n\nA member of the original Technical Alliance, which also included Thorstein Veblen and Leland Olds, Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: \"Some day we make the good things of life for everybody\".\n\nEngineering wizard\n\nSteinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of alternating current (AC) systems theory: hysteresis, steady-state analysis, and transients.See also IEC Electropedia's: [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref\n351-45-16 hysteresis], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref603-02-06 steady state of a system], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref\n102-02-09 complex number] and [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=351-45-08 transient behaviour].\n\nAC hysteresis theory\n\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, which gave him worldwide professional recognition.  Eickemeyer's firm developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed General Electric Company, where he quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.\n\nAC steady state circuit theory\n\nSteinmetz's work revolutionized AC circuit theory and analysis, which had been carried out using complicated, time-consuming calculus-based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, \"Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering\", presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to \"a simple problem of algebra\". He systematized the use of complex number phasor representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the lower-case letter \"j\" is used to designate the 90-degree rotation operator in AC system analysis. His seminal books and many other AIEE papers \"taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena\".\n\nAC transient theory\n\nSteinmetz also made greater strides to the understanding of lightning phenomena.  He undertook a systematic study of it, resulting in experiments with \"man-made lightning\" in the laboratory; this work was published. Steinmetz was called the \"forger of thunderbolts\", being the first to create artificial lightning in his football field-sized laboratory and high towers built at General Electric, using 120,000 volt generators. He erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning, and studied the patterns and effects of lightning resulting in several theories and ideas.\n\nProfessional life\n\nSteinmetz acted in the following professional capacities:\n*at Union College, as chair of electrical engineering from 1902 to 1913lemelson.mit.edu website, [http://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-steinmetz \"Charles Steinmetz\"] and as faculty member thereafter until his death in 1923\n*as a board member on the Schenectady Board of Education for six years, including four years at the board's president\n*as a president of the Common Council of Schenectady \n*as the [http://ethw.org/List_of_Presidents_of_the_American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers_(AIEE) president] of the AIEE from 1901 to 1902 \n*as the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME) {which became the International Municipal Signal Association (IMSA)} from 1913 until his death in 1923.\n\nHe was granted an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1901 and a doctorate from Union College in 1903.\n\nSteinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not all about engineering. He was a member and adviser to the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta at Union College, whose chapter house there was one of the first electrified houses ever.\n\nWhile serving as president of the Schenectady Board of Education, Steinmetz introduced reforms including extended school hours, school meals, school nurses, special classes for the children of immigrants, and the distribution of free textbooks.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAlthough Steinmetz loved children and family life, he knew that both his father and grandfather suffered from the same spine deformity that afflicted him. Therefore, he did not marry, for fear of passing on his deformity to any descendants.\n\nWhen Joseph LeRoy Hayden, a loyal and hardworking lab assistant, announced that he would marry and look for his own living quarters, Steinmetz made an unusual proposal regarding living arrangements. He proposed that Hayden's new wife and prospective family move into a large house Steinmetz had already built with its own research lab, greenhouse, and office. He carefully courted Hayden and his wife Corinne, before broaching his proposal. Hayden favored the idea, but his wife was very wary of this unorthodox setup. She finally agreed after Steinmetz acceded to her conditions, notably that she could \"run the house as I see fit\".\n\nAfter an uneasy start, the arrangement worked well for all parties, especially after the Haydens had three children. Steinmetz legally adopted Joseph Hayden as his son, and became the \"grandfather\" of the children, entertaining them with fantastic stories and spectacular scientific demonstrations. The unusual but harmonious living arrangements lasted for the rest of Steinmetz's life.\n\nSteinmetz founded America's first glider club, but none of the glider prototypes developed in this club \"could be dignified with the term 'flight'\".Crouch, Tom D.
