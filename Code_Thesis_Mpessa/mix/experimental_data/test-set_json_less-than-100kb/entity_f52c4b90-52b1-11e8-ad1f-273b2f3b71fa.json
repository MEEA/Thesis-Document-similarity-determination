These were generally considered, both at the time  and by modern scholarship, to be attempts to supply a forged copy of a lost document. The exception is a Latin Epistola ad Laodicenses (\"Epistle to the Laodiceans\"),Michael D. Marlowe, Bible Research website, [http://www.bible-researcher.com/laodiceans.html The Epistle to the Laodiceans], published October 2010, accessed 8 February 2018 which is actually a short compilation of verses from other Pauline epistles, principally Philippians, and on which scholarly opinion is divided as to whether it is the lost Marcionite forgery or alternatively an orthodox replacement of the Marcionite text. In either case it is generally considered a \"clumsy forgery\" and an attempt to seek to fill the \"gap\" suggested by Colossians 4:16.Miracle and mission Page 151 James A. Kelhoffer - 2000 \"Schneemelcher writes of this letter, \"It is a rather clumsy forgery, the purpose of which is to have in the Pauline corpus the Epistle of the Laodiceans mentioned in Col. 4:16\" (NTApo, 2.44).\"\n\nSome ancient sources, such as Hippolytus, and some modern scholars consider that the epistle \"from Laodicea\" was never a lost epistle, but simply Paul re-using one of his other letters (the most common candidate is the contemporary Epistle to the Ephesians), just as he asks for the copying and forwarding of the Letter to Colossians to Laodicea.\n\nThe Colossians 4:16 mention \n\nPaul, the earliest known Christian author, wrote several letters (or epistles) in Greek to various churches. Paul apparently dictated all his epistles through a secretary (or amanuensis), but wrote the final few paragraphs of each letter by his own hand.Harris, p. 316-320. Harris cites , , , , Joseph Barber Lightfoot in his Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians writes: \"At this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name(; ) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\" Many survived and are included in the New Testament, but others are known to have been lost.

The New American Standard Bible (NASB) translates this verse in the latter manner, and translations in other languages such as the Dutch Statenvertaling translate it likewise: \"When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter (that is coming) from Laodicea.\"[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?bCol&c\n4&v16&t\nNASB#16 NASB translation][http://www.biblija.net/biblija.cgi?mColossians+4%3A16&id42\n1&id371&id43\n1&lnl&set\n10 Statenvertaling], (Jongbloed  1637 edd.)

The oldest known Bible copy of this epistle is in a Fulda manuscript written for Victor of Capua in 546. It is mentioned by various writers from the fourth century onwards, notably by Pope Gregory the Great, to whose influence may ultimately be due the frequent occurrence of it in Bibles written in England; for it is more common in English Bibles than in others. John Wycliffe included Paul's letter to the Laodiceans in his Bible translation from the Latin to English. However this epistle is not without controversy because there is no evidence of a Greek text.M.R. James, [http://www.comparative-religion.com/christianity/apocrypha/new-testament-apocrypha/4/7.php Epistle to the Laodiceans], translation and commentary\n\nThe text was almost unanimously considered pseudepigraphal when the Christian Biblical canon was decided upon, and does not appear in any Greek copies of the Bible at all, nor is it known in Syriac or other versions.[http://reluctant-messenger.com/epistle-laodiceans.htm Paul's Epistle to the Laodiceans] from The Reluctant Messenger Jerome, who wrote the Latin Vulgate translation, wrote in the 4th century, \"it is rejected by everyone\".Jerome, Lives of Illustrious Men, Chapter 5. However, it evidently gained a certain degree of respect. It appeared in over 100 surviving early Latin copies of the Bible.

Some scholars suggest that it was created to offset the popularity of the Marcionite epistle.\n\nWilhelm Schneemelcher's standard work, New Testament Apocrypha (Chapter 14 Apostolic Pseudepigrapha) includes a section on the Latin Epistle to the Laodiceans and a translation of the Latin text.",
