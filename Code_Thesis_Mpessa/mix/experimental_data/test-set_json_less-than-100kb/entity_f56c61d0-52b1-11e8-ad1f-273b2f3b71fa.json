  "textBody" : "In complex analysis, an entire function, also called an integral function, is a complex-valued function that is holomorphic at all finite points over the whole complex plane. Typical examples of entire functions are polynomials and the exponential function, and any finite sums, products and compositions of these, such as the trigonometric functions sine and cosine and their hyperbolic counterparts sinh and cosh, as well as derivatives and integrals of entire functions such as the error function. If an entire function f(z) has a root at w, then f(z)/(z−w), taking the limit value at w, is an entire function. On the other hand, neither the natural logarithm nor the square root is an entire function, nor can they be continued analytically to an entire function.\n\nA transcendental entire function is an entire function that is not a polynomial.\n\nProperties\n\nEvery entire function f(z) can be represented as a power series\nf(z)\\sum_{n\n0}^\\infty a_nz^n\nthat converges everywhere in the complex plane, hence uniformly on compact sets. The radius of convergence is infinite, which implies that\n\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|a_n\\right|^{\\frac{1}{n}}=0\nor\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln|a_n|}n=-\\infty.\n\nAny power series satisfying this criterion will represent an entire function.\n\nIf (and only if) the coefficients of the power series are all real then the function evidently takes real values for real arguments, and the value of the function at the complex conjugate of z will be the complex conjugate of the value at z. Such functions are sometimes called self-conjugate (the conjugate function, F^*(z), being given by \\bar F(\\bar z)).See for example \n\nIf the real part of an entire function is known in a neighborhood of a point then both the real and imaginary parts are known for the whole complex plane, up to an imaginary constant. For instance, if the real part is known in a neighborhood of zero, then we can find the coefficients for n > 0 from the following derivatives with respect to a real variable r:\n\n\\operatorname{Re}a_n\\frac 1{n!}\\frac{d^n}{dr^n}\\operatorname{Re}f(r)\\ \\text{ at }r\n0\n\n\\operatorname{Im}a_n\\frac 1{n!}\\frac{d^n}{dr^n}\\operatorname{Re}f(re^{-i\\pi/(2n)})\\ \\text{ at }r\n0.\n(Likewise, if the imaginary part is known in a neighborhood then the function is determined up to a real constant.) In fact, if the real part is known just on an arc of a circle, then the function is determined up to an imaginary constant. (For instance, if it the real part is known on part of the unit circle, then it is known on the whole unit circle by analytic extension, and then the coefficients of the infinite series are determined from the coefficients of the Fourier series for the real part on the unit circle.) Note however that an entire function is not determined by its real part on all curves. In particular, if the real part is given on any curve in the complex plane where the real part of some other entire function is zero, then any multiple of that function can be added to the function we are trying to determine. For example, if the curve where the real part is known is the real line, then we can add i times any self-conjugate function. If the curve forms a loop, then it is determined by the real part of the function on the loop since the only functions whose real part is zero on the curve are those that are everywhere equal to some imaginary number.\n\nThe Weierstrass factorization theorem asserts that any entire function can be represented by a product involving its zeroes (or \"roots\").\n\nThe entire functions on the complex plane form an integral domain (in fact a Prüfer domain). They also form a commutative unital associative algebra over the complex numbers.\n\nLiouville's theorem states that any bounded entire function must be constant.  Liouville's theorem may be used to elegantly prove the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nAs a consequence of Liouville's theorem, any function that is entire on the whole Riemann sphere (complex plane and the point at infinity) is constant. Thus any non-constant entire function must have a singularity at the complex point at infinity, either a pole for a polynomial or an essential singularity for a transcendental entire function.  Specifically, by the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem, for any transcendental entire function f and any complex w there is a sequence  with \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} |z_m| \\infty and \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} f(z_m) \n w\\ .\n\nPicard's little theorem is a much stronger result: any non-constant entire function takes on every complex number as value, possibly with a single exception. When an exception exists, it is called a lacunary value of the function. The possibility of a lacunary value  is illustrated by the exponential function, which never takes on the value 0. One can take a suitable branch of the logarithm of an entire function that never hits 0, so that this will also be an entire function (according to the Weierstrass factorization theorem). The logarithm hits every complex number except possibly one number, which implies that the first function will hit any value other than 0 an infinite number of times. Similarly, a non-constant, entire function that does not hit a particular value will hit every other value an infinite number of times.\n\nLiouville's theorem is a special case of the following statement:\n\nTheorem: Assume M, R are positive constants and that n is a non-negative integer. An entire function f satisfying the inequality |f(z)| \\le M |z|^n for all z with |z| \\ge R, is necessarily a polynomial, of degree at most n.The converse is also true as for any polynomial \\textstyle p(z) \\sum _{k\n0}^na_k z^k of degree n the inequality \\textstyle |p(z)| \\le \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n|a_k|\\right) |z|^n holds for any |z| ≥ 1. Similarly, an entire function f satisfying the inequality M |z|^n \\le |f(z)| for all z with |z| \\ge R, is necessarily a polynomial, of degree at least n.\n\nGrowth\n\nEntire functions may grow as fast as any increasing function: for any increasing function g : [0,+∞)  → [0,+∞)  there exists an entire function f(z) such that f(x) > g( |x| ) for all real x. Such a function f may be easily found of the form:\n\nf(z)c+\\sum_{k\n1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{z}{k}\\right)^{n_k}\n\nfor a constant c and a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers nk. Any such sequence defines an entire function f(z), and if the powers are chosen appropriately we may satisfy the inequality f(x) > g( |x| ) for all real x. (For instance, it certainly holds if one chooses c:g(2) and, for any integer k ≥ 1, n_k: \n 2 \\big\\lceil k \\ln g(k+2) \\big\\rceil \\, although this gives powers that may be about twice as high as needed.)\n\n Order and type \n\nThe order (at infinity) of an entire function f(z) is defined using the limit superior as:\n\n\\rho=\\limsup_{r\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(\\ln\\Vert f \\Vert_{\\infty, B_r}       )}{\\ln\\, r},\n\nwhere  Br is the disk of radius r and  \\Vert f \\Vert_{\\infty,\\,B_r} denotes the supremum norm of f(z) on Br. The order is a non-negative real number or infinity (except if f(z)0 for all z). In other words, the order of f(z) is the infimum of all m such that f(z) \n O(exp(|z|m)) as z → ∞. (A function like \\exp(2z^2) shows that this does not mean f(z) = O(exp(|z|m)) if f(z) is of order m.)\n\nIf 0\\sigma=\\limsup_{r\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln  \\Vert f\\Vert_{\\infty,B_r}} {r^\\rho}.\n\nIf the order is 1 and the type is σ, the function is said to be \"of exponential type σ\".
