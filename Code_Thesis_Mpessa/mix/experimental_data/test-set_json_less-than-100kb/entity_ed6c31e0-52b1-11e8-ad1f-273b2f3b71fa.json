  "textBody" : "In mathematics, when the elements of some set S have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an equivalence relation) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set S into equivalence classes. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements a and b belong to the same equivalence class if and only if a and b are equivalent.\n\nFormally, given a set  and an equivalence relation  on , the equivalence class of an element  in  is the set\n\n\\{ x \\in S \\mid x \\sim a \\}\n\nof elements which are equivalent to . It may be proven from the defining properties of \"equivalence relations\" that the equivalence classes form a partition of . This partition – the set of equivalence classes – is sometimes called the quotient set or the quotient space of  by  and is denoted by .\n\nWhen the set  has some structure (such as a group operation or a topology) and the equivalence relation ~ is defined in a manner suitably compatible with this structure, then the quotient set often inherits a similar structure from its parent set. Examples include quotient spaces in linear algebra, quotient spaces in topology, quotient groups, homogeneous spaces, quotient rings, quotient monoids, and quotient categories.\n\nExamples\n\n* If  is the set of all cars, and  is the equivalence relation \"has the same color as\", then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars.  could be naturally identified with the set of all car colors.\n* Let  be the set of all rectangles in a plane, and  the equivalence relation \"has the same area as\". For each positive real number A there will be an equivalence class of all the rectangles that have area A.\n* Consider the modulo 2 equivalence relation on the set  of integers:  if and only if their difference  is an even number. This relation gives rise to exactly two equivalence classes: one class consisting of all even numbers, and the other consisting of all odd numbers. Under this relation , , and  all represent the same element of .\n* Let  be the set of ordered pairs of integers  with  not zero, and define an equivalence relation  on  according to which  if and only if . Then the equivalence class of the pair  can be identified with the rational number , and this equivalence relation and its equivalence classes can be used to give a formal definition of the set of rational numbers. The same construction can be generalized to the field of fractions of any integral domain.\n* If  consists of all the lines in, say the Euclidean plane, and L ~ M means that L and M are parallel lines, then the set of lines that are parallel to each other form an equivalence class as long as a line is considered parallel to itself. In this situation, each equivalence class determines a point at infinity.\n\nNotation and formal definition\n\nAn equivalence relation is a binary relation  satisfying three properties:\n*For every element  in ,  (reflexivity),\n*For every two elements  and  in , if , then  (symmetry),\n*For every three elements , , and  in , if  and , then  (transitivity).\n\nThe equivalence class of an element  is denoted  and is defined as the set\n\n[a] = \\{ x \\in X \\mid a \\sim x \\}\n\nof elements that are related to  by . An alternative notation  can be used to denote the equivalence class of the element , specifically with respect to the equivalence relation . This is said to be the -equivalence class of .\n\nThe set of all equivalence classes in  with respect to an equivalence relation  is denoted as  and called  modulo  (or the quotient set of  by ). The surjective map  x\\mapsto [x] from  onto , which maps each element to its equivalence class, is called the canonical surjection or the canonical projection map.\n\nWhen an element is chosen (often implicitly) in each equivalence class, this defines an injective map called a section. If this section is denoted by , one has  for every equivalence class . The element  is called a representative of . Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.\n\nSometimes, there is a section that is more \"natural\" than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called canonical representatives. For example, in modular arithmetic, consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by  if  is a multiple of a given integer , called the modulus. Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than , and these integers are the canonical representatives. The class and its representative are more or less identified, as is witnessed by the fact that the notation  may denote either the class or its canonical representative (which is the remainder of the division of  by ).\n\nProperties\n\nEvery element  of  is a member of the equivalence class . Every two equivalence classes  and  are either equal or disjoint. Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of  forms a partition of : every element of  belongs to one and only one equivalence class. Conversely every partition of  comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which  if and only if  and  belong to the same set of the partition.\n\nIt follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that\n:  if and only if .\n\nIn other words, if  is an equivalence relation on a set , and  and  are two elements of , then these statements are equivalent:\n\n* x \\sim y\n* [x] = [y]\n* [x] \\cap [y] \\ne \\emptyset.\n\nGraphical representation\n\nAn undirected graph may be associated to any symmetric relation on a set , where the vertices are the elements of , and two vertices  and  are joined if and only if . Among these graphs are the graphs of equivalence relations; they are characterized as the graphs such that the connected components are cliques.\n\nInvariants\n\nIf  is an equivalence relation on , and  is a property of elements of  such that whenever ,  is true if  is true, then the property  is said to be an invariant of , or well-defined under the relation .\n\nA frequent particular case occurs when  is a function from  to another set ; if   whenever , then  is said to be class invariant under , or simply invariant under . This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use \"compatible with \" or just \"respects \" instead of \"invariant under \".\n\nAny function  itself defines an equivalence relation on  according to which  if and only if . The equivalence class of  is the set of all elements in  which get mapped to , i.e. the class  is the inverse image of . This equivalence relation is known as the kernel of .\n\nMore generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation  on ) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation  on ). Such a function is a morphism of sets equipped with an equivalence relation.\n\nQuotient space in topology\n\nIn topology, a quotient space is a topological space formed on the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a topological space using the original space's topology to create the topology on the set of equivalence classes.\n\nIn abstract algebra, congruence relations on the underlying set of an algebra allow the algebra to induce an algebra on the equivalence classes of the relation, called a quotient algebra. In linear algebra, a quotient space is a vector space formed by taking a quotient group where the quotient homomorphism is a linear map. By extension, in abstract algebra, the term quotient space may be used for quotient modules, quotient rings, quotient groups, or any quotient algebra. However, the use of the term for the more general cases can as often be by analogy with the orbits of a group action.\n\nThe orbits of a group action on a set may be called the quotient space of the action on the set, particularly when the orbits of the group action are the right cosets of a subgroup of a group, which arise from the action of the subgroup on the group by left translations, or respectively the left cosets as orbits under right translation.\n\nA normal subgroup of a topological group, acting on the group by translation action, is a quotient space in the senses of topology, abstract algebra, and group actions simultaneously.\n\nAlthough the term can be used for any equivalence relation's set of equivalence classes, possibly with further structure, the intent of using the term is generally to compare that type of equivalence relation on a set X either to an equivalence relation that induces some structure on the set of equivalence classes from a structure of the same kind on X, or to the orbits of a group action. Both the sense of a structure preserved by an equivalence relation and the study of invariants under group actions lead to the definition of invariants of equivalence relations given above.",
