  "textBody" : "Hiberno‐English (from Latin Hibernia: \"Ireland\") or Irish English is the set of English dialects natively written and spoken within the island of Ireland (including both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland).\n\nEnglish was brought to Ireland as a result of the Norman invasion of Ireland of the late 12th century. Initially, it was mainly spoken in an area known as the Pale around Dublin, with mostly Irish spoken throughout the rest of the country. By the Tudor period, Irish culture and language had regained most of the territory lost to the invaders: even in the Pale, \"all the common folk… for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit, and of Irish language\". Some small pockets remained predominantly English-speaking; because of their sheer isolation their dialects developed into a dialect (known as Yola) that was no longer mutually intelligible with other English varieties. However, the Tudor conquest and colonisation of Ireland in the 16th century marked a revival in the use of English. By the mid-19th century, English was the majority language spoken in the country.  It has retained this status to the present day, with even those whose first language is Irish being fluent in English as well. It is one of two official languages, along with Irish, of the Republic of Ireland, and is the country's de facto working language.\n\nHiberno-English's spelling and pronunciation standards align with British rather than American English. However, Hiberno-English's diverse accents and some of its grammatical structures are unique, with some influence by the Irish language and a tendency to be phonologically conservative, retaining older features no longer common in the accents of England or North America.\n\nPhonologists today often divide Hiberno-English into four or five overarching classes of dialects or accents:Hickey, Raymond. A Sound Atlas of Irish English, Volume 1. Walter de Gruyter: 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZK9cSYRrjMC&q pp. 57-60]. Ulster accents, West and South-West Region accents (including, for example, the Cork accent), various Dublin accents, and a relatively recent supraregional accent.\n\nUlster English\n\nUlster English (or northern Irish English) here refers collectively to the varieties of the Ulster province, including Northern Ireland and neighbouring counties outside of Northern Ireland, which has been influenced by Ulster Irish as well as the Scots language, brought over by Scottish settlers during the Plantation of Ulster. Its main subdivisions are mid Ulster English as well as Ulster Scots English, the latter of which is more directly and strongly influenced by the Scots language. All Ulster English has more obvious pronunciation similarities with Scottish English than other Irish English dialects.\n\nUlster varieties distinctly pronounce:\n*An ordinarily grammatically structured (i.e. non-topicalised) declarative sentences, often, with a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (the type of intonation pattern that other English speakers usually associate with questions).\n* as lowered, in the general vicinity of.\n* as fronted and slightly rounded, more closely approaching.\n* and both in the general vicinity of.\n* with a backed on-glide and fronted off-glide, putting it in the vicinity of.\n* as, particularly before voiceless consonants.\n* as, though nowadays commonly or even when in a closed syllable.\n*, almost always, as a slightly raised monophthong.\n*A lack of happy-tensing; with the final vowel of happy, holy, money, etc. as.\n*Syllable-final occasionally as \"dark [ɫ]\", though especially before a consonant.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Christine Bleakley, Jamie Dornan, Rory McIlroy, Liam Neeson – \"The Northern Irish accent is the sexiest in the UK, according to a new poll.

Irish Examiner. 2015.\n\nDublin English\n\nDublin English is highly internally diverse and refers collectively to the Irish English varieties of eastern Ireland (the province of Leinster). Modern-day Dublin English largely lies on a phonological continuum, ranging from a more traditional, lower-prestige, local urban accent on the one end to a more recently developing, higher-prestige, non-local (regional and even supraregional) accent on the other end, whose most advanced characteristics only first emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s. The accent that most strongly uses the traditional working-class features is often called local Dublin English. Most speakers from Dublin and its suburbs, however, have accent features falling variously along the entire middle as well as newer end of the spectrum, which together form what is called non-local Dublin English, spoken by middle- and upper-class natives of Dublin and the greater eastern Irish region surrounding the city. A subset of this variety, whose middle-class speakers mostly range in the middle of the continuum, is called mainstream Dublin English. Mainstream Dublin English has become the basis of an accent that has otherwise become supraregional (see more below) everywhere except in the north of the country. The majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s (led particularly by females) has shifted towards the most innovative non-local accent, here called new Dublin English, which has gained ground over mainstream Dublin English and which is the most extreme variety in rejecting the local accent's traditional features.Hickey, Raymond (2015). [https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/dublin.htm Dublin English]  Irish English Resource Centre. University of Duisburg and Essen. The varieties at either extreme of the spectrum, local and new Dublin English, are both discussed in further detail below. In the most general terms, all varieties of Dublin English have the following identifying sounds that are often distinct from the rest of Ireland, pronouncing:\n* as fronted and/or raised.\n* as retracted and/or centralised.\n* as a diphthong in the range (local to non-local) of.\n\nLocal Dublin English\n\nLocal Dublin English (or popular Dublin English) here refers to a traditional, broad, working-class variety spoken in the Republic of Ireland's capital city of Dublin. It is the only Irish English variety that in earlier history was non-rhotic; however, it is today weakly rhotic, and it uniquely pronounces:\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* and, respectively, as and.\n\nThe local Dublin accent is also known for a phenomenon called \"vowel breaking\", in which the vowel sounds,,, and in closed syllables are \"broken\" into two syllables, approximating,,, and, respectively.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Damien Dempsey – \"his distinctly Dublin sounds\" and \"a working class Dublin accent\"Reynolds, Deirdre. \"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/lunch-with-damien-dempsey-ronnie-drew-never-watered-down-his-accent-why-should-i-29417339.html Lunch with Damien Dempsey: Ronnie Drew never watered down his accent – why should I?]\". Independent.ie. 2013.\n*Imelda May  – \"Irish celebrities who have distinctive accents — such as Imelda May\"\n*Conor McGregor\n\nNew Dublin English\n\nEvolving as a fashionable outgrowth of the mainstream non-local Dublin English, new Dublin English (also, advanced Dublin English and, formerly, fashionable Dublin English) is a youthful variety that originally began in the early 1990s among the \"avant-garde\" and now those aspiring to a non-local \"urban sophistication\". New Dublin English itself, first associated with affluent and middle-class inhabitants of southside Dublin, is probably now spoken by a majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s. It has replaced (yet was largely influenced by) moribund D4 English (often known as \"Dublin 4\" or \"DART speak\" or, mockingly, \"Dortspeak\"), which originated around the 1970s from Dubliners who rejected traditional notions of Irishness, regarding themselves as more trendy and sophisticated; however, particular aspects of the D4 accent became quickly noticed and ridiculed as sounding affected, causing these features to fall out of fashion by the 1990s.\n\nThis \"new mainstream\" accent of Dublin's youth, rejecting traditional working-class Dublin, pronounces:\n* as open as.\n* may be, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.\n* as high as or even, causing a re-split in the cot–caught merger that traditionally characterised Dublin speech.\n* as high as or even.\n* as the Londonian diphthong.\n* and as both possibly rounded, perhaps causing a fur–fair merger.\n* and as possibly merged, as well as and as possibly merged, leading to potential horse–hoarse and witch–which mergers.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Saoirse Ronan – \"the 'Dub' accent in which she speaks\"Linehan, Hugh (2016). \"[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/saoirse-ronan-s-accent-should-not-be-a-talking-point-1.2490377 Saoirse Ronan’s accent should not be a talking point]\".

Metro. 2010.\n\nSupraregional southern Irish English\n\nSupraregional southern Irish English (sometimes, simply, supraregional Irish English or supraregional Hiberno-English) here refers to a variety crossing regional boundaries throughout all of the Republic of Ireland, except the north. As mentioned earlier, mainstream Dublin English of the early- to mid-1900s is the direct influence and catalyst for this variety. Most speakers born in the 1980s or later are showing fewer features of the twentieth-century mainstream supraregional form and more characteristics of an advanced supraregional variety that aligns clearly with the rapidly spreading new Dublin accent (see more above, under \"Non-local Dublin English\").\n\nIreland's surparegional dialect pronounces:\n* as quite open.\n* along a possible spectrum, with innovative [ɑɪ] particularly more common before voiced consonants, notably including /r/.\n* as starting fronter and often more raised than other dialects:.\n* may be, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.\n* as.\n* as, almost always separate from, keeping words like war and wore, or horse and hoarse, pronounced distinctly.\n* as.\n* as a diphthong, approaching, as in the mainstream United States, or, as in mainstream England.\n* as higher, fronter, and often rounder.\n\nOverview of pronunciation and phonology\n\nThe following charts list the vowels typical of each Irish English dialect as well as the several distinctive consonants of Irish English. Phonological characteristics of overall Irish English are given as well as categorisations into five major divisions of Hiberno-English: northern Ireland (or Ulster); West & South-West Ireland; local Dublin; new Dublin; and supraregional (southern) Ireland. Features of mainstream non-local Dublin English fall on a range between \"local Dublin\" and \"new Dublin\".\n\nPure vowels (monophthongs)\n\nThe defining monophthongs of Irish English:\n\nThe following pure vowel sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:\n*The vowel, as in cut or run, is typically centralised in the mouth and often somewhat more rounded than other standard English varieties, such as Received Pronunciation in England or General American in the United States. \n*Most Irish English varieties make some distinction between the \"broad\" a and \"flat\" a of Received Pronunciation, whereas General American, for example, makes no distinction. \n* There is inconsistency regarding the lot–cloth split and the cot–caught merger; certain Irish English dialects have these phenomena while others do not.\n* Any and many are pronounced to rhyme with nanny, Danny, etc. by very many speakers, i.e. with each of these words pronounced with.\n\nAll pure vowels of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\nIn southside Dublin's once-briefly fashionable \"Dublin 4\" (or \"Dortspeak\") accent, the \" and broad\" set becomes rounded as [ɒː].Hickey, Raymond. [https://books.google.com/books?id\nAmpOAwl3KzcC&q=%22the+label+%27dublin+4%27%22 Dublin English: Evolution and Change]. John Benjamins Publishing: 2005, pp. 46-48\n\n In South-West Ireland, before /n/ or /m/ is raised to [ɪ].\n\n Due to the local Dublin accent's phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\", /iː/ may be realised in this accent as [iʲə] in a closed syllable, and, in the same environment, /uː/ may be realised as [ʊuʷə].\n\nUnstressed syllable-final /iː/ or /ɪ/ is realised in Ulster accents uniquely as [e~ɪ].\n\nOther notes:\n\n*In some highly conservative Irish English varieties, words spelled with ea and pronounced with in RP are pronounced with, for example meat, beat, and leaf.\n* In words like took where the spelling \"oo\" usually represents, conservative speakers may use. This is most common in local Dublin and the speech of north-east Leinster.\n\nGliding vowels (diphthongs)\n\nThe defining diphthongs of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe following gliding vowel (diphthong) sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:\n*The first element of the diphthong, as in ow or doubt, may move forward in the mouth in the east (namely, Dublin) and supraregionally; however, it may actually move backward throughout the entire rest of the country. In the north alone, the second element is particularly moved forward, as in Scotland.  \n*The first element of the diphthong, as in boy or choice, is slightly or significantly lowered in all geographic regions except the north.\n*The diphthong, as in rain or bay, is most commonly monophthongised to. Furthermore, this often lowers to in words such as gave and came (sounding like \"gev\" and \"kem\").\n\nAll diphthongs of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:'\n \nDue to the local Dublin accent's phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\", may be realised in that accent as [əjə] in a closed syllable, and, in the same environment, may be realised as [ɛwə].\n\nR-coloured vowels\n\nThe defining r-coloured vowels of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe following r-coloured vowel features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: \n*Rhoticity: Every major accent of Hiberno-English pronounces the letter \"r\" whenever it follows a vowel sound, though this is weaker in the local Dublin accent due to its earlier history of non-rhoticity. Rhoticity is a feature that Hiberno-English shares with Canadian English and General American but not with Received Pronunciation. \n*The distinction between and is almost always preserved, so that, for example, horse and hoarse are not merged in most Irish accents.\n\nAll r-coloured vowels of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\n In older varieties of the conservative accents, like local Dublin, the \"r\" sound before a vowel may be pronounced as a tapped [ɾ], rather than as the typical approximant [ɹ̠].\n\nEvery major accent of Irish English is rhotic (pronounces \"r\" after a vowel sound). The local Dublin accent is the only one that during an earlier time was non-rhotic, though it usually very lightly rhotic today, with a few minor exceptions. The rhotic consonant in this and most other Irish accents is an approximant [ɹ̠].\n\nThe \"r\" sound of the mainstream non-local Dublin accent is more precisely a velarised approximant [ɹˠ], while the  \"r\" sound of the more recently emerging non-local Dublin (or \"new Dublin\") accent is more precisely a retroflex approximant [ɻ].\n\nIn southside Dublin's once-briefly fashionable \"Dublin 4\" (or \"Dortspeak\") accent, /ɑr/ is realised as [ɒːɹ].\n\nIn non-local Dublin's more recently emerging (or \"new Dublin\") accent, /ɛər/ and /ɜr/ may both be realised more rounded as [øːɻ].\n\nIn local Dublin, West/South-West, and other very conservative and traditional Irish English varieties ranging from the south to the north, the phoneme /ɜr/ is split into two distinct phonemes depending on spelling and preceding consonants, which have sometimes been represented as /ɛr/ versus /ʊr/, and often more precisely pronounced as [ɛːɹ] versus [ʊːɹ]. As an example, the words earn and urn are not pronounced the same, as they are in most dialects of English around the world. In the local Dublin and West/South-West accents, /ɜr/ when after a labial consonant (e.g. fern), when spelled as \"ur\" or \"or\" (e.g. word), or when spelled as \"ir\" after an alveolar stop (e.g. dirt) are pronounced as [ʊːɹ]; in all other situations, /ɜr/ is pronounced as [ɛːɹ]. Example words include:\n\n/ɛr/\n*certain [ˈsɛːɹtn̩]\n*chirp [ˈtʃɛːɹp]\n*circle [ˈsɛːɹkəl]\n*earn [ɛːɹn]\n*earth [ɛːɹt]\n*girl [gɛːɹl]\n*germ [dʒɛːɹm]\n*heard or herd [hɛːɹd]\n*irk [ɛːɹk]\n*tern [tɛːɹn]\n\n/ʊr/\n*bird [bʊːɹd]\n*dirt [dʊːɹt]\n*first [fʊːɹst]\n*murder [ˈmʊːɹdɚ]\n*nurse [ˈnʊːɹs]\n*turn [tʊːɹn]\n*third or turd [tʊːɹd]\n*urn [ʊːɹn]\n*work [wʊːɹk]\n*world [wʊːɹld]. \n\nIn non-local Dublin, younger, and supraregional Irish accents, this split is seldom preserved, with both of the /ɜr/ phonemes typically merged as [ɚː].\n\nIn rare few local Dublin varieties that are non-rhotic, is either lowered to or backed and raised to.\n\nThe distinction between and is widely preserved in Ireland, so that, for example, horse and hoarse are not merged in most Irish English dialects; however, they are usually merged in Belfast and new Dublin.\n\nIn local Dublin, due to the phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\" may in fact be realised as.\n\nConsonants\n\nThe defining consonants of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe consonants of Hiberno-English mostly align to the typical English consonant sounds. However, a few Irish English consonants have distinctive, varying qualities. The following consonant features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: \n*H-fulness: Unlike most English varieties of England and Wales, which drop the word-initial /h/ sound in words like house or happy, Hiberno-English always retains word-initial.\n*The phonemes (as in the) and (as in thin) are pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English. is pronounced as or, depending on specific dialect; and is pronounced as or.\n*The phoneme, when appearing at the end of word or between vowel sounds, is pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English; the most common pronunciation is as a \"slit fricative\".\n*The phoneme is almost always of a \"light\" or \"clear\" quality (i.e. not velarised), unlike Received Pronunciation, which uses both a clear and a dark \"L\" sound, or General American, which pronounces all \"L\" sounds as somewhat dark.\n*Rhoticity: The pronunciation of historical /r/ is nearly universal in Irish accents of English. Like with General American (but not Received Pronunciation), this means that the letter \"r\", if appearing after a vowel sound, is always pronounced (in words such as here, cart, or surf).\n\nUnique consonants in various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\nIn traditional, conservative Ulster English, /k/ and /g/ are palatalised before a low front vowel.\n\nLocal Dublin also undergoes cluster simplification, so that stop consonant sounds occurring after fricatives or sonorants may be left unpronounced, resulting, for example, in \"poun(d)\" and \"las(t)\".\n\nRhoticity: Every major accent of Irish English is strongly rhotic (pronounces \"r\" after a vowel sound), though to a weaker degree with the local Dublin accent. The accents of local Dublin and some smaller eastern towns like Drogheda were historically non-rhotic and now only very lightly rhotic or variably rhotic, with the rhotic consonant being an alveolar approximant, [ɹ]. In extremely traditional and conservative accents (exemplified, for instance, in the speech of older speakers throughout the country, even in South-West Ireland, such as Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh and Jackie Healy-Rae), the rhotic consonant, before a vowel sound, can also be an alveolar tap, [ɾ]. The rhotic consonant for the northern Ireland and new Dublin accents is a retroflex approximant, [ɻ]. Dublin's retroflex approximant has no precedent outside of northern Ireland and is a genuine innovation of the past two decades. A guttural/uvular is found in north-east Leinster. Otherwise, the rhotic consonant of virtually all other Irish accents is the postalveolar approximant, [ɹ].\n\nThe symbol [θ̠] is used here to represent the voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative, sometimes known as a \"slit fricative\", whose articulation is described as being apico-alveolar.\n\nOverall, and are being increasingly merged in supraregional Irish English, for example, making wine and whine homophones, as in most varieties of English around the world.\n\nOther phonological characteristics of Irish English include that consonant clusters ending in before are distinctive:\n* is dropped after sonorants and fricatives, e.g. new sounds like noo, and sue like soo.\n* becomes, e.g. dew/due, duke and duty sound like \"jew\", \"jook\" and \"jooty\".\n* becomes, e.g. tube is \"choob\", tune is \"choon\"\n*The following show neither dropping nor coalescence: (as in cute), (as in mute), and (as in huge; though the /h/ can be dropped in the South-West of Ireland).\n\nThe naming of the letter H as \"haitch\" is standard.\n\nDue to Gaelic influence, an epenthetic schwa is sometimes inserted, perhaps as a feature of older and less careful speakers, e.g. film [ˈfɪləm] and form [ˈfɒːɹəm].\n\nVocabulary\n\nLoan words from Irish\n\nA number of Irish-language loan words are used in Hiberno-English, particularly in an official state capacity.  For example, the head of government is the Taoiseach, the deputy head is the Tánaiste, the parliament is the Oireachtas and its lower house is Dáil Éireann. Less formally, people also use loan words in day-to-day speech, although this has been on the wane in recent decades and among the young.\n\nDerived words from Irish \n\nAnother group of Hiberno-English words are those derived from the Irish language. Some are words in English that have entered into general use, while others are unique to Ireland. These words and phrases are often Anglicised versions of words in Irish or direct translations into English. In the latter case, they often give a meaning to a word or phrase that is generally not found in wider English use.\n\nDerived words from Old and Middle English\n\nAnother class of vocabulary found in Hiberno-English are words and phrases common in Old and Middle English, but which have since become obscure or obsolete in the modern English language generally. Hiberno-English has also developed particular meanings for words that are still in common use in English generally.\n\nOther words\n\nIn addition to the three groups above, there are also additional words and phrases whose origin is disputed or unknown. While this group may not be unique to Ireland, their usage is not widespread, and could be seen as characteristic of the language in Ireland.\n\nGrammar and syntax\n\nThe syntax of the Irish language is quite different from that of English. Various aspects of Irish syntax have influenced Hiberno-English, though many of these idiosyncrasies are disappearing in suburban areas and among the younger population.\n\nThe other major influence on Hiberno-English that sets it apart from modern English in general is the retention of words and phrases from Old- and Middle-English.\n\nFrom Irish\n\nReduplication\n\nReduplication is an alleged trait of Hiberno-English strongly associated with Stage Irish and Hollywood films.\n\n* the Irish ar bith corresponds to English \"at all\", so the stronger ar chor ar bith gives rise to the form \"at all at all\".\n**\"I've no time at all at all.\"\n* ar eagla go … (lit. \"on fear that …\") means \"in case …\". The variant ar eagla na heagla, (lit. \"on fear of fear\") implies the circumstances are more unlikely. The corresponding Hiberno-English phrases are \"to be sure\" and \"to be sure to be sure\". In this context, these are not, as might be thought, disjuncts meaning \"certainly\"; they could better be translated \"in case\" and \"just in case\". Nowadays normally spoken with conscious levity.\n** \"I brought some cash in case I saw a bargain, and my credit card to be sure to be sure.\"\n\nYes and no\n\nIrish lacks words that directly translate as \"yes\" or \"no\", and instead repeats the verb used in the question, negated if necessary, to answer. Hiberno-English uses \"yes\" and \"no\" less frequently than other English dialects as speakers can repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of (or in redundant addition to) using \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n* \"Are you coming home soon?\" – \"I am.\"\n* \"Is your mobile charged?\" – \"It isn't.\"\n\nThis is not limited only to the verb to be: it is also used with to have when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb to do is used. This is most commonly used for intensification, especially in Ulster English.\n* \"This is strong stuff, so it is.\"\n* \"We won the game, so we did.\"\n\nRecent past construction\n\nIrish indicates recency of an action by adding \"after\" to the present continuous (a verb ending in \"-ing\"), a construction known as the \"hot news perfect\" or \"after perfect\". The idiom for \"I had done X when I did Y\" is \"I was after doing X when I did Y\", modelled on the Irish usage of the compound prepositions i ndiaidh, tar éis, and in éis: bhí mé tar éis/i ndiaidh/in éis X a dhéanamh, nuair a rinne mé Y.\n* \"Why did you hit him?\" – \"He was after giving me cheek.\"\nA similar construction is seen where exclamation is used in describing a recent event:\n* \"I'm after hitting him with the car!\" Táim tar éis é a bhualadh leis an gcarr!\n* \"She's after losing five stone in five weeks!\"\n\nWhen describing less astonishing or significant events, a structure resembling the German perfect can be seen:\n* \"I have the car fixed.\" Tá an carr deisithe agam.\n* \"I have my breakfast eaten.\" Tá mo bhricfeasta ithe agam.\n\nThis correlates with an analysis of \"H1 Irish\" proposed by Adger & Mitrovic,Adger (2004) in a deliberate parallel to the status of German as a V2 language.\n\nReflection for emphasis\n\nThe reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context.  Herself, for example, might refer to the speaker's boss or to the woman of the house. Use of herself or himself in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question. Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, She's coming now\n* \"'Tis herself that's coming now.\" Is í féin atá ag teacht anois.\n* \"Was it all of ye or just yourself?\" An sibhse ar fad nó tusa féin a bhí i gceist?\n\nPrepositional pronouns\n\nThere are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb to have in Irish. Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition at, (in Irish, ag.). To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ag \"at\" and mé \"me\" to create agam.\nIn English, the verb \"to have\" is used, along with a \"with me\" or \"on me\" that derives from Tá … agam.  This gives rise to the frequent\n* \"Do you have the book?\" – \"I have it with me.\"\n* \"Have you change for the bus on you?\"\n* \"He will not shut up if he has drink taken.\"\nSomebody who can speak a language \"has\" a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.\n* \"She does not have Irish.\" Níl Gaeilge aici. literally \"There is no Irish at her\".\n\nWhen describing something, many Hiberno-English speakers use the term \"in it\" where \"there\" would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ann (pronounced \"oun\" or \"on\") fulfilling both meanings.\n* \"Is it yourself that is in it?\" An tú féin atá ann?\n* \"Is there any milk in it?\" An bhfuil bainne ann?\n\nAnother idiom is this thing or that thing described as \"this man here\" or \"that man there\", which also features in Newfoundland English in Canada.\n* \"This man here.\" An fear seo. (cf. the related anseo = here)\n* \"That man there.\" An fear sin. (cf. the related ansin = there)\n\nConditionals have a greater presence in Hiberno-English due to the tendency to replace the simple present tense with the conditional (would) and the simple past tense with the conditional perfect (would have).\n* \"John asked me would I buy a loaf of bread.\" (John asked me to buy a loaf of bread.)\n* \"How do you know him? We would have been in school together.\" (We went to school together.)\n\nBring and take: Irish use of these words differs from that of British English because it follows the Irish grammar for beir and tóg. English usage is determined by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one takes \"from here to there\", and brings it \"to here from there\". In Irish, a person takes only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone elseand a person brings at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).\n* Don't forget to bring your umbrella with you when you leave.\n* (To a child) Hold my hand: I don't want someone to take you.\n\nTo be\n\nThe Irish equivalent of the verb \"to be\" has two present tenses, one (the present tense proper or \"aimsir láithreach\") for cases which are generally true or are true at the time of speaking and the other (the habitual present or \"aimsir ghnáthláithreach\") for repeated actions. Thus, \"you are [now, or generally]\" is tá tú, but \"you are [repeatedly]\" is bíonn tú. Both forms are used with the verbal noun (equivalent to the English present participle) to create compound tenses. This is similar to the distinction between ser and estar in Spanish.\n\nThe corresponding usage in English is frequently found in rural areas, especially Mayo/Sligo in the west of Ireland and Wexford in the south-east, Inner-City Dublin along with border areas of the North and Republic. In this form, the verb \"to be\" in English is similar to its use in Irish, with a \"does be/do be\" (or \"bees\", although less frequently) construction to indicate the continuous, or habitual, present:\n* \"He does be working every day.\" Bíonn sé ag obair gach lá.\n* \"They do be talking on their mobiles a lot.\" Bíonn siad ag caint go minic ar a bhfóin póca.\n* \"He does be doing a lot of work at school.\" Bíonn sé ag déanamh go leor oibre ar scoil.\n* \"It's him I do be thinking of.\" Is air a bhíonn mé ag smaoineamh.\n\nThis construction also surfaces in African American Vernacular English, as the famous habitual be.\n\nFrom Old and Middle English\n\nIn old-fashioned usage, \"it is\" can be freely abbreviated ’tis, even as a standalone sentence. This also allows the double contraction ’tisn’t, for \"it is not\".\n\nIrish has separate forms for the second person singular (tú) and the second person plural (sibh).\nMirroring Irish, and almost every other Indo European language, the plural you is also distinguished from the singular in Hiberno-English, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word ye; the word yous (sometimes written as youse) also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and across Ulster. In addition, in some areas in Leinster, north Connacht and parts of Ulster, the hybrid word ye-s, pronounced \"yiz\", may be used. The pronunciation differs with that of the northwestern being and the Leinster pronunciation being.\n\n* \"Did ye all go to see it?\" Ar imigh sibh go léir chun é a fheicint?\n* \"None of youse have a clue!\" Níl ciall/leid ar bith agaibh!\n* \"Are ye not finished yet?\" Nach bhfuil sibh críochnaithe fós?\n* \"Yis are after destroying it!\" Tá sibh tar éis é a scriosadh!\n\nThe word ye, yis or yous, otherwise archaic, is still used in place of \"you\" for the second-person plural. Ye'r, Yisser or Yousser are the possessive forms, e.g. \"Where are yous going?\"\n\nThe verb mitch is very common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school. This word appears in Shakespeare (though he wrote in Early Modern English rather than Middle English), but is seldom heard these days in British English, although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably South Wales, Devon, and Cornwall). In parts of Connacht and Ulster the mitch is often replaced by the verb scheme, while in Dublin it is often replaced by \"on the hop/bounce\".\n\nAnother usage familiar from Shakespeare is the inclusion of the second person pronoun after the imperative form of a verb, as in \"Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed\" (Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene IV). This is still common in Ulster: \"Get youse your homework done or you're no goin' out!\" In Munster, you will still hear children being told, \"Up to bed, let ye\".\n\nFor influence from Scotland, see Ulster Scots and Ulster English.\n\nOther grammatical influences\n\nNow is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning. Examples include \"Bye now\" (\"Goodbye\"), \"There you go now\" (when giving someone something), \"Ah now!\" (expressing dismay), \"Hold on now\" (\n \"wait a minute\"), \"Now then\" as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.  It is also used in the manner of the Italian 'prego' or German 'bitte', for example a barman might say \"Now, Sir.\" when delivering drinks.\n\nSo is often used for emphasis (\"I can speak Irish, so I can\"), or it may be tacked onto the end of a sentence to indicate agreement, where \"then\" would often be used in Standard English (\"Bye so\", \"Let's go so\", \"That's fine so\", \"We'll do that so\"). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement (\"You're not pushing hard enough\" – \"I am so!\"). (This contradiction of a negative is also seen in American English, though not as often as \"I am too\", or \"Yes, I am\".) The practice of indicating emphasis with so and including reduplicating the sentence's subject pronoun and auxiliary verb (is, are, have, has, can, etc.) such as in the initial example, is particularly prevalent in more northern dialects such as those of Sligo, Mayo and the counties of Ulster.\n\nSure is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement, roughly translating as but/and/well. Can be used as \"to be sure\", the famous Irish stereotype phrase. (But note that the other stereotype of \"Sure and …\" is not actually used in Ireland.) Or \"Sure, I can just go on Wednesday\", \"I will not, to be sure.\" The word is also used at the end of sentences (primarily in Munster), for instance \"I was only here five minutes ago, sure!\" and can express emphasis or indignation.\n\nTo is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, \"I'm not let go out tonight\", instead of \"I'm not allowed to go out tonight\".\n\nWill is often used where British English would use \"shall\" or American English \"should\" (as in \"Will I make us a cup of tea?\"). The distinction between \"shall\" (for first-person simple future, and second- and third-person emphatic future) and \"will\" (second- and third-person simple future, first-person emphatic future), maintained by many in England, does not exist in Hiberno-English, with \"will\" generally used in all cases.\n\nOnce is sometimes used in a different way from how it is used in other dialects; in this usage, it indicates a combination of logical and causal conditionality: \"I have no problem laughing at myself once the joke is funny.\"  Other dialects of English would probably use \"if\" in this situation.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Hiberno‐English (from Latin Hibernia: \"Ireland\") or Irish English is the set of English dialects natively written and spoken within the island of Ireland (including both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland).\n\nEnglish was brought to Ireland as a result of the Norman invasion of Ireland of the late 12th century. Initially, it was mainly spoken in an area known as the Pale around Dublin, with mostly Irish spoken throughout the rest of the country. By the Tudor period, Irish culture and language had regained most of the territory lost to the invaders: even in the Pale, \"all the common folk… for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit, and of Irish language\". Some small pockets remained predominantly English-speaking; because of their sheer isolation their dialects developed into a dialect (known as Yola) that was no longer mutually intelligible with other English varieties. However, the Tudor conquest and colonisation of Ireland in the 16th century marked a revival in the use of English. By the mid-19th century, English was the majority language spoken in the country.  It has retained this status to the present day, with even those whose first language is Irish being fluent in English as well. It is one of two official languages, along with Irish, of the Republic of Ireland, and is the country's de facto working language.\n\nHiberno-English's spelling and pronunciation standards align with British rather than American English. However, Hiberno-English's diverse accents and some of its grammatical structures are unique, with some influence by the Irish language and a tendency to be phonologically conservative, retaining older features no longer common in the accents of England or North America.\n\nPhonologists today often divide Hiberno-English into four or five overarching classes of dialects or accents:Hickey, Raymond. A Sound Atlas of Irish English, Volume 1. Walter de Gruyter: 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZK9cSYRrjMC&q pp. 57-60]. Ulster accents, West and South-West Region accents (including, for example, the Cork accent), various Dublin accents, and a relatively recent supraregional accent.\n\nUlster English\n\nUlster English (or northern Irish English) here refers collectively to the varieties of the Ulster province, including Northern Ireland and neighbouring counties outside of Northern Ireland, which has been influenced by Ulster Irish as well as the Scots language, brought over by Scottish settlers during the Plantation of Ulster. Its main subdivisions are mid Ulster English as well as Ulster Scots English, the latter of which is more directly and strongly influenced by the Scots language. All Ulster English has more obvious pronunciation similarities with Scottish English than other Irish English dialects.\n\nUlster varieties distinctly pronounce:\n*An ordinarily grammatically structured (i.e. non-topicalised) declarative sentences, often, with a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (the type of intonation pattern that other English speakers usually associate with questions).\n* as lowered, in the general vicinity of.\n* as fronted and slightly rounded, more closely approaching.\n* and both in the general vicinity of.\n* with a backed on-glide and fronted off-glide, putting it in the vicinity of.\n* as, particularly before voiceless consonants.\n* as, though nowadays commonly or even when in a closed syllable.\n*, almost always, as a slightly raised monophthong.\n*A lack of happy-tensing; with the final vowel of happy, holy, money, etc. as.\n*Syllable-final occasionally as \"dark [ɫ]\", though especially before a consonant.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Christine Bleakley, Jamie Dornan, Rory McIlroy, Liam Neeson – \"The Northern Irish accent is the sexiest in the UK, according to a new poll.

Irish Examiner. 2015.\n\nDublin English\n\nDublin English is highly internally diverse and refers collectively to the Irish English varieties of eastern Ireland (the province of Leinster). Modern-day Dublin English largely lies on a phonological continuum, ranging from a more traditional, lower-prestige, local urban accent on the one end to a more recently developing, higher-prestige, non-local (regional and even supraregional) accent on the other end, whose most advanced characteristics only first emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s. The accent that most strongly uses the traditional working-class features is often called local Dublin English. Most speakers from Dublin and its suburbs, however, have accent features falling variously along the entire middle as well as newer end of the spectrum, which together form what is called non-local Dublin English, spoken by middle- and upper-class natives of Dublin and the greater eastern Irish region surrounding the city. A subset of this variety, whose middle-class speakers mostly range in the middle of the continuum, is called mainstream Dublin English. Mainstream Dublin English has become the basis of an accent that has otherwise become supraregional (see more below) everywhere except in the north of the country. The majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s (led particularly by females) has shifted towards the most innovative non-local accent, here called new Dublin English, which has gained ground over mainstream Dublin English and which is the most extreme variety in rejecting the local accent's traditional features.Hickey, Raymond (2015). [https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/dublin.htm Dublin English]  Irish English Resource Centre. University of Duisburg and Essen. The varieties at either extreme of the spectrum, local and new Dublin English, are both discussed in further detail below. In the most general terms, all varieties of Dublin English have the following identifying sounds that are often distinct from the rest of Ireland, pronouncing:\n* as fronted and/or raised.\n* as retracted and/or centralised.\n* as a diphthong in the range (local to non-local) of.\n\nLocal Dublin English\n\nLocal Dublin English (or popular Dublin English) here refers to a traditional, broad, working-class variety spoken in the Republic of Ireland's capital city of Dublin. It is the only Irish English variety that in earlier history was non-rhotic; however, it is today weakly rhotic, and it uniquely pronounces:\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* as.\n* and, respectively, as and.\n\nThe local Dublin accent is also known for a phenomenon called \"vowel breaking\", in which the vowel sounds,,, and in closed syllables are \"broken\" into two syllables, approximating,,, and, respectively.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Damien Dempsey – \"his distinctly Dublin sounds\" and \"a working class Dublin accent\"Reynolds, Deirdre. \"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/lunch-with-damien-dempsey-ronnie-drew-never-watered-down-his-accent-why-should-i-29417339.html Lunch with Damien Dempsey: Ronnie Drew never watered down his accent – why should I?]\". Independent.ie. 2013.\n*Imelda May  – \"Irish celebrities who have distinctive accents — such as Imelda May\"\n*Conor McGregor\n\nNew Dublin English\n\nEvolving as a fashionable outgrowth of the mainstream non-local Dublin English, new Dublin English (also, advanced Dublin English and, formerly, fashionable Dublin English) is a youthful variety that originally began in the early 1990s among the \"avant-garde\" and now those aspiring to a non-local \"urban sophistication\". New Dublin English itself, first associated with affluent and middle-class inhabitants of southside Dublin, is probably now spoken by a majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s. It has replaced (yet was largely influenced by) moribund D4 English (often known as \"Dublin 4\" or \"DART speak\" or, mockingly, \"Dortspeak\"), which originated around the 1970s from Dubliners who rejected traditional notions of Irishness, regarding themselves as more trendy and sophisticated; however, particular aspects of the D4 accent became quickly noticed and ridiculed as sounding affected, causing these features to fall out of fashion by the 1990s.\n\nThis \"new mainstream\" accent of Dublin's youth, rejecting traditional working-class Dublin, pronounces:\n* as open as.\n* may be, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.\n* as high as or even, causing a re-split in the cot–caught merger that traditionally characterised Dublin speech.\n* as high as or even.\n* as the Londonian diphthong.\n* and as both possibly rounded, perhaps causing a fur–fair merger.\n* and as possibly merged, as well as and as possibly merged, leading to potential horse–hoarse and witch–which mergers.\n\nNotable lifelong native speakers\n\n*Saoirse Ronan – \"the 'Dub' accent in which she speaks\"Linehan, Hugh (2016). \"[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/saoirse-ronan-s-accent-should-not-be-a-talking-point-1.2490377 Saoirse Ronan’s accent should not be a talking point]\".

Metro. 2010.\n\nSupraregional southern Irish English\n\nSupraregional southern Irish English (sometimes, simply, supraregional Irish English or supraregional Hiberno-English) here refers to a variety crossing regional boundaries throughout all of the Republic of Ireland, except the north. As mentioned earlier, mainstream Dublin English of the early- to mid-1900s is the direct influence and catalyst for this variety. Most speakers born in the 1980s or later are showing fewer features of the twentieth-century mainstream supraregional form and more characteristics of an advanced supraregional variety that aligns clearly with the rapidly spreading new Dublin accent (see more above, under \"Non-local Dublin English\").\n\nIreland's surparegional dialect pronounces:\n* as quite open.\n* along a possible spectrum, with innovative [ɑɪ] particularly more common before voiced consonants, notably including /r/.\n* as starting fronter and often more raised than other dialects:.\n* may be, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.\n* as.\n* as, almost always separate from, keeping words like war and wore, or horse and hoarse, pronounced distinctly.\n* as.\n* as a diphthong, approaching, as in the mainstream United States, or, as in mainstream England.\n* as higher, fronter, and often rounder.\n\nOverview of pronunciation and phonology\n\nThe following charts list the vowels typical of each Irish English dialect as well as the several distinctive consonants of Irish English. Phonological characteristics of overall Irish English are given as well as categorisations into five major divisions of Hiberno-English: northern Ireland (or Ulster); West & South-West Ireland; local Dublin; new Dublin; and supraregional (southern) Ireland. Features of mainstream non-local Dublin English fall on a range between \"local Dublin\" and \"new Dublin\".\n\nPure vowels (monophthongs)\n\nThe defining monophthongs of Irish English:\n\nThe following pure vowel sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:\n*The vowel, as in cut or run, is typically centralised in the mouth and often somewhat more rounded than other standard English varieties, such as Received Pronunciation in England or General American in the United States. \n*Most Irish English varieties make some distinction between the \"broad\" a and \"flat\" a of Received Pronunciation, whereas General American, for example, makes no distinction. \n* There is inconsistency regarding the lot–cloth split and the cot–caught merger; certain Irish English dialects have these phenomena while others do not.\n* Any and many are pronounced to rhyme with nanny, Danny, etc. by very many speakers, i.e. with each of these words pronounced with.\n\nAll pure vowels of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\nIn southside Dublin's once-briefly fashionable \"Dublin 4\" (or \"Dortspeak\") accent, the \" and broad\" set becomes rounded as [ɒː].Hickey, Raymond.

John Benjamins Publishing: 2005, pp. 46-48\n\n In South-West Ireland, before /n/ or /m/ is raised to [ɪ].\n\n Due to the local Dublin accent's phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\", /iː/ may be realised in this accent as [iʲə] in a closed syllable, and, in the same environment, /uː/ may be realised as [ʊuʷə].\n\nUnstressed syllable-final /iː/ or /ɪ/ is realised in Ulster accents uniquely as [e~ɪ].\n\nOther notes:\n\n*In some highly conservative Irish English varieties, words spelled with ea and pronounced with in RP are pronounced with, for example meat, beat, and leaf.\n* In words like took where the spelling \"oo\" usually represents, conservative speakers may use. This is most common in local Dublin and the speech of north-east Leinster.\n\nGliding vowels (diphthongs)\n\nThe defining diphthongs of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe following gliding vowel (diphthong) sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:\n*The first element of the diphthong, as in ow or doubt, may move forward in the mouth in the east (namely, Dublin) and supraregionally; however, it may actually move backward throughout the entire rest of the country. In the north alone, the second element is particularly moved forward, as in Scotland.  \n*The first element of the diphthong, as in boy or choice, is slightly or significantly lowered in all geographic regions except the north.\n*The diphthong, as in rain or bay, is most commonly monophthongised to. Furthermore, this often lowers to in words such as gave and came (sounding like \"gev\" and \"kem\").\n\nAll diphthongs of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:'\n \nDue to the local Dublin accent's phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\", may be realised in that accent as [əjə] in a closed syllable, and, in the same environment, may be realised as [ɛwə].\n\nR-coloured vowels\n\nThe defining r-coloured vowels of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe following r-coloured vowel features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: \n*Rhoticity: Every major accent of Hiberno-English pronounces the letter \"r\" whenever it follows a vowel sound, though this is weaker in the local Dublin accent due to its earlier history of non-rhoticity. Rhoticity is a feature that Hiberno-English shares with Canadian English and General American but not with Received Pronunciation. \n*The distinction between and is almost always preserved, so that, for example, horse and hoarse are not merged in most Irish accents.\n\nAll r-coloured vowels of various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\n In older varieties of the conservative accents, like local Dublin, the \"r\" sound before a vowel may be pronounced as a tapped [ɾ], rather than as the typical approximant [ɹ̠].\n\nEvery major accent of Irish English is rhotic (pronounces \"r\" after a vowel sound). The local Dublin accent is the only one that during an earlier time was non-rhotic, though it usually very lightly rhotic today, with a few minor exceptions. The rhotic consonant in this and most other Irish accents is an approximant [ɹ̠].\n\nThe \"r\" sound of the mainstream non-local Dublin accent is more precisely a velarised approximant [ɹˠ], while the  \"r\" sound of the more recently emerging non-local Dublin (or \"new Dublin\") accent is more precisely a retroflex approximant [ɻ].\n\nIn southside Dublin's once-briefly fashionable \"Dublin 4\" (or \"Dortspeak\") accent, /ɑr/ is realised as [ɒːɹ].\n\nIn non-local Dublin's more recently emerging (or \"new Dublin\") accent, /ɛər/ and /ɜr/ may both be realised more rounded as [øːɻ].\n\nIn local Dublin, West/South-West, and other very conservative and traditional Irish English varieties ranging from the south to the north, the phoneme /ɜr/ is split into two distinct phonemes depending on spelling and preceding consonants, which have sometimes been represented as /ɛr/ versus /ʊr/, and often more precisely pronounced as [ɛːɹ] versus [ʊːɹ]. As an example, the words earn and urn are not pronounced the same, as they are in most dialects of English around the world. In the local Dublin and West/South-West accents, /ɜr/ when after a labial consonant (e.g. fern), when spelled as \"ur\" or \"or\" (e.g. word), or when spelled as \"ir\" after an alveolar stop (e.g. dirt) are pronounced as [ʊːɹ]; in all other situations, /ɜr/ is pronounced as [ɛːɹ]. Example words include:\n\n/ɛr/\n*certain [ˈsɛːɹtn̩]\n*chirp [ˈtʃɛːɹp]\n*circle [ˈsɛːɹkəl]\n*earn [ɛːɹn]\n*earth [ɛːɹt]\n*girl [gɛːɹl]\n*germ [dʒɛːɹm]\n*heard or herd [hɛːɹd]\n*irk [ɛːɹk]\n*tern [tɛːɹn]\n\n/ʊr/\n*bird [bʊːɹd]\n*dirt [dʊːɹt]\n*first [fʊːɹst]\n*murder [ˈmʊːɹdɚ]\n*nurse [ˈnʊːɹs]\n*turn [tʊːɹn]\n*third or turd [tʊːɹd]\n*urn [ʊːɹn]\n*work [wʊːɹk]\n*world [wʊːɹld]. \n\nIn non-local Dublin, younger, and supraregional Irish accents, this split is seldom preserved, with both of the /ɜr/ phonemes typically merged as [ɚː].\n\nIn rare few local Dublin varieties that are non-rhotic, is either lowered to or backed and raised to.\n\nThe distinction between and is widely preserved in Ireland, so that, for example, horse and hoarse are not merged in most Irish English dialects; however, they are usually merged in Belfast and new Dublin.\n\nIn local Dublin, due to the phenomenon of \"vowel breaking\" may in fact be realised as.\n\nConsonants\n\nThe defining consonants of Hiberno-English:\n\nThe consonants of Hiberno-English mostly align to the typical English consonant sounds. However, a few Irish English consonants have distinctive, varying qualities. The following consonant features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: \n*H-fulness: Unlike most English varieties of England and Wales, which drop the word-initial /h/ sound in words like house or happy, Hiberno-English always retains word-initial.\n*The phonemes (as in the) and (as in thin) are pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English. is pronounced as or, depending on specific dialect; and is pronounced as or.\n*The phoneme, when appearing at the end of word or between vowel sounds, is pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English; the most common pronunciation is as a \"slit fricative\".\n*The phoneme is almost always of a \"light\" or \"clear\" quality (i.e. not velarised), unlike Received Pronunciation, which uses both a clear and a dark \"L\" sound, or General American, which pronounces all \"L\" sounds as somewhat dark.\n*Rhoticity: The pronunciation of historical /r/ is nearly universal in Irish accents of English. Like with General American (but not Received Pronunciation), this means that the letter \"r\", if appearing after a vowel sound, is always pronounced (in words such as here, cart, or surf).\n\nUnique consonants in various Hiberno-English dialects:\n\nFootnotes:\n\nIn traditional, conservative Ulster English, /k/ and /g/ are palatalised before a low front vowel.\n\nLocal Dublin also undergoes cluster simplification, so that stop consonant sounds occurring after fricatives or sonorants may be left unpronounced, resulting, for example, in \"poun(d)\" and \"las(t)\".\n\nRhoticity: Every major accent of Irish English is strongly rhotic (pronounces \"r\" after a vowel sound), though to a weaker degree with the local Dublin accent. The accents of local Dublin and some smaller eastern towns like Drogheda were historically non-rhotic and now only very lightly rhotic or variably rhotic, with the rhotic consonant being an alveolar approximant, [ɹ]. In extremely traditional and conservative accents (exemplified, for instance, in the speech of older speakers throughout the country, even in South-West Ireland, such as Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh and Jackie Healy-Rae), the rhotic consonant, before a vowel sound, can also be an alveolar tap, [ɾ]. The rhotic consonant for the northern Ireland and new Dublin accents is a retroflex approximant, [ɻ]. Dublin's retroflex approximant has no precedent outside of northern Ireland and is a genuine innovation of the past two decades. A guttural/uvular is found in north-east Leinster. Otherwise, the rhotic consonant of virtually all other Irish accents is the postalveolar approximant, [ɹ].\n\nThe symbol [θ̠] is used here to represent the voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative, sometimes known as a \"slit fricative\", whose articulation is described as being apico-alveolar.\n\nOverall, and are being increasingly merged in supraregional Irish English, for example, making wine and whine homophones, as in most varieties of English around the world.\n\nOther phonological characteristics of Irish English include that consonant clusters ending in before are distinctive:\n* is dropped after sonorants and fricatives, e.g. new sounds like noo, and sue like soo.\n* becomes, e.g. dew/due, duke and duty sound like \"jew\", \"jook\" and \"jooty\".\n* becomes, e.g. tube is \"choob\", tune is \"choon\"\n*The following show neither dropping nor coalescence: (as in cute), (as in mute), and (as in huge; though the /h/ can be dropped in the South-West of Ireland).\n\nThe naming of the letter H as \"haitch\" is standard.\n\nDue to Gaelic influence, an epenthetic schwa is sometimes inserted, perhaps as a feature of older and less careful speakers, e.g. film [ˈfɪləm] and form [ˈfɒːɹəm].\n\nVocabulary\n\nLoan words from Irish\n\nA number of Irish-language loan words are used in Hiberno-English, particularly in an official state capacity.  For example, the head of government is the Taoiseach, the deputy head is the Tánaiste, the parliament is the Oireachtas and its lower house is Dáil Éireann. Less formally, people also use loan words in day-to-day speech, although this has been on the wane in recent decades and among the young.\n\nDerived words from Irish \n\nAnother group of Hiberno-English words are those derived from the Irish language. Some are words in English that have entered into general use, while others are unique to Ireland. These words and phrases are often Anglicised versions of words in Irish or direct translations into English. In the latter case, they often give a meaning to a word or phrase that is generally not found in wider English use.\n\nDerived words from Old and Middle English\n\nAnother class of vocabulary found in Hiberno-English are words and phrases common in Old and Middle English, but which have since become obscure or obsolete in the modern English language generally. Hiberno-English has also developed particular meanings for words that are still in common use in English generally.\n\nOther words\n\nIn addition to the three groups above, there are also additional words and phrases whose origin is disputed or unknown. While this group may not be unique to Ireland, their usage is not widespread, and could be seen as characteristic of the language in Ireland.\n\nGrammar and syntax\n\nThe syntax of the Irish language is quite different from that of English. Various aspects of Irish syntax have influenced Hiberno-English, though many of these idiosyncrasies are disappearing in suburban areas and among the younger population.\n\nThe other major influence on Hiberno-English that sets it apart from modern English in general is the retention of words and phrases from Old- and Middle-English.\n\nFrom Irish\n\nReduplication\n\nReduplication is an alleged trait of Hiberno-English strongly associated with Stage Irish and Hollywood films.\n\n* the Irish ar bith corresponds to English \"at all\", so the stronger ar chor ar bith gives rise to the form \"at all at all\".\n**\"I've no time at all at all.\"\n* ar eagla go … (lit. \"on fear that …\") means \"in case …\". The variant ar eagla na heagla, (lit. \"on fear of fear\") implies the circumstances are more unlikely. The corresponding Hiberno-English phrases are \"to be sure\" and \"to be sure to be sure\". In this context, these are not, as might be thought, disjuncts meaning \"certainly\"; they could better be translated \"in case\" and \"just in case\". Nowadays normally spoken with conscious levity.\n** \"I brought some cash in case I saw a bargain, and my credit card to be sure to be sure.\"\n\nYes and no\n\nIrish lacks words that directly translate as \"yes\" or \"no\", and instead repeats the verb used in the question, negated if necessary, to answer. Hiberno-English uses \"yes\" and \"no\" less frequently than other English dialects as speakers can repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of (or in redundant addition to) using \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n* \"Are you coming home soon?\" – \"I am.\"\n* \"Is your mobile charged?\" – \"It isn't.\"\n\nThis is not limited only to the verb to be: it is also used with to have when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb to do is used. This is most commonly used for intensification, especially in Ulster English.\n* \"This is strong stuff, so it is.\"\n* \"We won the game, so we did.\"\n\nRecent past construction\n\nIrish indicates recency of an action by adding \"after\" to the present continuous (a verb ending in \"-ing\"), a construction known as the \"hot news perfect\" or \"after perfect\". The idiom for \"I had done X when I did Y\" is \"I was after doing X when I did Y\", modelled on the Irish usage of the compound prepositions i ndiaidh, tar éis, and in éis: bhí mé tar éis/i ndiaidh/in éis X a dhéanamh, nuair a rinne mé Y.\n* \"Why did you hit him?\" – \"He was after giving me cheek.\"\nA similar construction is seen where exclamation is used in describing a recent event:\n* \"I'm after hitting him with the car!\" Táim tar éis é a bhualadh leis an gcarr!\n* \"She's after losing five stone in five weeks!\"\n\nWhen describing less astonishing or significant events, a structure resembling the German perfect can be seen:\n* \"I have the car fixed.\" Tá an carr deisithe agam.\n* \"I have my breakfast eaten.\" Tá mo bhricfeasta ithe agam.\n\nThis correlates with an analysis of \"H1 Irish\" proposed by Adger & Mitrovic,Adger (2004) in a deliberate parallel to the status of German as a V2 language.\n\nReflection for emphasis\n\nThe reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context.  Herself, for example, might refer to the speaker's boss or to the woman of the house. Use of herself or himself in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question. Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, She's coming now\n* \"'Tis herself that's coming now.\" Is í féin atá ag teacht anois.\n* \"Was it all of ye or just yourself?\" An sibhse ar fad nó tusa féin a bhí i gceist?\n\nPrepositional pronouns\n\nThere are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb to have in Irish. Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition at, (in Irish, ag.). To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ag \"at\" and mé \"me\" to create agam.\nIn English, the verb \"to have\" is used, along with a \"with me\" or \"on me\" that derives from Tá … agam.  This gives rise to the frequent\n* \"Do you have the book?\" – \"I have it with me.\"\n* \"Have you change for the bus on you?\"\n* \"He will not shut up if he has drink taken.\"\nSomebody who can speak a language \"has\" a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.\n* \"She does not have Irish.\" Níl Gaeilge aici. literally \"There is no Irish at her\".\n\nWhen describing something, many Hiberno-English speakers use the term \"in it\" where \"there\" would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ann (pronounced \"oun\" or \"on\") fulfilling both meanings.\n* \"Is it yourself that is in it?\" An tú féin atá ann?\n* \"Is there any milk in it?\" An bhfuil bainne ann?\n\nAnother idiom is this thing or that thing described as \"this man here\" or \"that man there\", which also features in Newfoundland English in Canada.\n* \"This man here.\" An fear seo. (cf. the related anseo = here)\n* \"That man there.\" An fear sin. (cf. the related ansin = there)\n\nConditionals have a greater presence in Hiberno-English due to the tendency to replace the simple present tense with the conditional (would) and the simple past tense with the conditional perfect (would have).\n* \"John asked me would I buy a loaf of bread.\" (John asked me to buy a loaf of bread.)\n* \"How do you know him? We would have been in school together.\" (We went to school together.)\n\nBring and take: Irish use of these words differs from that of British English because it follows the Irish grammar for beir and tóg. English usage is determined by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one takes \"from here to there\", and brings it \"to here from there\". In Irish, a person takes only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone elseand a person brings at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).\n* Don't forget to bring your umbrella with you when you leave.\n* (To a child) Hold my hand: I don't want someone to take you.\n\nTo be\n\nThe Irish equivalent of the verb \"to be\" has two present tenses, one (the present tense proper or \"aimsir láithreach\") for cases which are generally true or are true at the time of speaking and the other (the habitual present or \"aimsir ghnáthláithreach\") for repeated actions. Thus, \"you are [now, or generally]\" is tá tú, but \"you are [repeatedly]\" is bíonn tú. Both forms are used with the verbal noun (equivalent to the English present participle) to create compound tenses. This is similar to the distinction between ser and estar in Spanish.\n\nThe corresponding usage in English is frequently found in rural areas, especially Mayo/Sligo in the west of Ireland and Wexford in the south-east, Inner-City Dublin along with border areas of the North and Republic. In this form, the verb \"to be\" in English is similar to its use in Irish, with a \"does be/do be\" (or \"bees\", although less frequently) construction to indicate the continuous, or habitual, present:\n* \"He does be working every day.\" Bíonn sé ag obair gach lá.\n* \"They do be talking on their mobiles a lot.\" Bíonn siad ag caint go minic ar a bhfóin póca.\n* \"He does be doing a lot of work at school.\" Bíonn sé ag déanamh go leor oibre ar scoil.\n* \"It's him I do be thinking of.\" Is air a bhíonn mé ag smaoineamh.\n\nThis construction also surfaces in African American Vernacular English, as the famous habitual be.\n\nFrom Old and Middle English\n\nIn old-fashioned usage, \"it is\" can be freely abbreviated ’tis, even as a standalone sentence. This also allows the double contraction ’tisn’t, for \"it is not\".\n\nIrish has separate forms for the second person singular (tú) and the second person plural (sibh).\nMirroring Irish, and almost every other Indo European language, the plural you is also distinguished from the singular in Hiberno-English, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word ye; the word yous (sometimes written as youse) also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and across Ulster. In addition, in some areas in Leinster, north Connacht and parts of Ulster, the hybrid word ye-s, pronounced \"yiz\", may be used. The pronunciation differs with that of the northwestern being and the Leinster pronunciation being.\n\n* \"Did ye all go to see it?\" Ar imigh sibh go léir chun é a fheicint?\n* \"None of youse have a clue!\" Níl ciall/leid ar bith agaibh!\n* \"Are ye not finished yet?\" Nach bhfuil sibh críochnaithe fós?\n* \"Yis are after destroying it!\" Tá sibh tar éis é a scriosadh!\n\nThe word ye, yis or yous, otherwise archaic, is still used in place of \"you\" for the second-person plural. Ye'r, Yisser or Yousser are the possessive forms, e.g. \"Where are yous going?\"\n\nThe verb mitch is very common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school. This word appears in Shakespeare (though he wrote in Early Modern English rather than Middle English), but is seldom heard these days in British English, although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably South Wales, Devon, and Cornwall). In parts of Connacht and Ulster the mitch is often replaced by the verb scheme, while in Dublin it is often replaced by \"on the hop/bounce\".\n\nAnother usage familiar from Shakespeare is the inclusion of the second person pronoun after the imperative form of a verb, as in \"Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed\" (Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene IV). This is still common in Ulster: \"Get youse your homework done or you're no goin' out!\" In Munster, you will still hear children being told, \"Up to bed, let ye\".\n\nFor influence from Scotland, see Ulster Scots and Ulster English.\n\nOther grammatical influences\n\nNow is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning. Examples include \"Bye now\" (\"Goodbye\"), \"There you go now\" (when giving someone something), \"Ah now!\" (expressing dismay), \"Hold on now\" (\n \"wait a minute\"), \"Now then\" as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.  It is also used in the manner of the Italian 'prego' or German 'bitte', for example a barman might say \"Now, Sir.\" when delivering drinks.\n\nSo is often used for emphasis (\"I can speak Irish, so I can\"), or it may be tacked onto the end of a sentence to indicate agreement, where \"then\" would often be used in Standard English (\"Bye so\", \"Let's go so\", \"That's fine so\", \"We'll do that so\"). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement (\"You're not pushing hard enough\" – \"I am so!\"). (This contradiction of a negative is also seen in American English, though not as often as \"I am too\", or \"Yes, I am\".) The practice of indicating emphasis with so and including reduplicating the sentence's subject pronoun and auxiliary verb (is, are, have, has, can, etc.) such as in the initial example, is particularly prevalent in more northern dialects such as those of Sligo, Mayo and the counties of Ulster.\n\nSure is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement, roughly translating as but/and/well. Can be used as \"to be sure\", the famous Irish stereotype phrase. (But note that the other stereotype of \"Sure and …\" is not actually used in Ireland.) Or \"Sure, I can just go on Wednesday\", \"I will not, to be sure.\" The word is also used at the end of sentences (primarily in Munster), for instance \"I was only here five minutes ago, sure!\" and can express emphasis or indignation.\n\nTo is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, \"I'm not let go out tonight\", instead of \"I'm not allowed to go out tonight\".\n\nWill is often used where British English would use \"shall\" or American English \"should\" (as in \"Will I make us a cup of tea?\"). The distinction between \"shall\" (for first-person simple future, and second- and third-person emphatic future) and \"will\" (second- and third-person simple future, first-person emphatic future), maintained by many in England, does not exist in Hiberno-English, with \"will\" generally used in all cases.\n\nOnce is sometimes used in a different way from how it is used in other dialects; in this usage, it indicates a combination of logical and causal conditionality: \"I have no problem laughing at myself once the joke is funny.\"  Other dialects of English would probably use \"if\" in this situation.
