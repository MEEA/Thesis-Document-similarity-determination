Along with his younger brother, Prince Woke, Oke was raised to greater prominence when Emperor Seinei died without an heir. The two young princes were said to be grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each of these brothers would ascend the throne as adopted heirs of Seinei, although it is unclear whether they had been \"found\" in Seinei's lifetime or only after that.Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id18oNAAAAIAAJ&&pg\nPA29#vonepage&q&f\nfalse p. 29].\n\nOke's younger brother, who would become posthumously known  as Emperor Kenzō, ascended before his elder brother.

Rather, it was presumably Sumeramikoto or Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi (治天下大王), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven.\"  Alternatively, Ninken might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\n\nNinken married to Emperor Yūryaku's daughter Kasuga no Ōiratsume no Himemiko, a second cousin of him. Their daughter Tashiraka was later married to Keitai, successor or possibly usurper after her brother, and became mother of Kinmei, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of all future monarchs of Japan. There apparently was also another daughter, princess Tachibana, who in turn is recorded to have become a wife of Senka and mother of princess Iwahime, who herself became a consort of Kimmei and bore Bidatsu, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of current monarchs of Japan.\n\nNinken was succeeded by his son, who would accede as Emperor Buretsu.Aston, William George.

This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Osaka.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ninken's mausoleum.  It is formally named Hanyū no Sakamoto no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 419.",
