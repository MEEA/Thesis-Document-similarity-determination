She wrote:\n\nThe actual fourth line is \"And laid him on the green\". Wright explained the need for a new term:\n\n \nHer essay had already described the bonny Earl holding the beautiful Lady Mondegreen's hand, both bleeding profusely but faithful unto death. She disputed:\n\nOther examples Wright suggested are:\n*Surely Good Mrs. Murphy shall follow me all the days of my life (\"Surely goodness and mercy…\" from Psalm 23)\n*The wild, strange battle cry \"Haffely, Gaffely, Gaffely, Gonward.\" (\"Half a league, half a league, / Half a league onward\", from \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\")\n\nPsychology\n\nPeople are more likely to notice what they expect than things not part of their everyday experiences, known as confirmation bias, and they may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version. For example, to consider a well-known mondegreen in the song \"Purple Haze\", one would be more likely to hear Jimi Hendrix singing that he is about to kiss this guy than that he is about to kiss the sky.

Without the improved communication and language standardization brought about by radio, he believes there would have been no way to recognize and discuss this shared experience. Just as mondegreens transform songs based on experience, a folk song learned by repetition is often transformed over time when sung by people in a region where some of the song's references have become obscure. A classic example is \"The Golden Vanity\", which contains the line \"As she sailed upon the lowland sea\".  English immigrants carried the song to Appalachia, where singers, not knowing what the term lowland sea refers to, transformed it over generations from \"lowland\" to \"lonesome\".\n\nExamples\n\nIn songs\n\nThe top three mondegreens submitted regularly to mondegreen expert Jon Carroll are:\n\n# Gladly, the cross-eyed bear (from the line in the hymn \"Keep Thou My Way\" by Fanny Crosby and Theodore E. Perkins, \"Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the cross I'll bear\"). Carroll and many others quote it as \"Gladly the cross I'd bear\"; They Might Be Giants allude to this line and its mishearing in their title album's song \"Hide Away, Folk Family\", which contains the line \"And sadly the cross-eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs\". \n# There's a bathroom on the right (the line at the end of each verse of \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival: \"There's a bad moon on the rise\").\n# Scuse me while I kiss this guy (from a lyric in the song \"Purple Haze\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"'Scuse me while I kiss the sky\").\n\nBoth Creedence's John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the \"mondegreen\" versions of their songs in concert.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/26/leadersandreply.mainsection2 Letters], The Guardian, 26 April 2007.This can be heard on his 1998 live album Premonition. [http://www.superseventies.com/faq_ccr.html CCR/John Fogerty FAQ] at superseventies.com.\n\nThe national anthem of the United States is highly susceptible (especially for young grade-school students) to the creation of mondegreens, two in the first line. Francis Scott Key's Star-Spangled Banner begins with the line \"O say can you see, by the dawn's early light.\"Francis Scott Key, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html The Star Spangled Banner] (lyrics), 1814, MENC: The National Association for Music Education National Anthem Project (archived from [http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html the original] [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html Archived] January 26, 2013, at the Wayback Machine. on 2013-01-26). This has been accidentally and deliberately misinterpreted as \"Jose, can you see,\" another example of the Hobson-Jobson effect, countless times. The second half of the line has been misheard as well, as \"by the donzerly light,\" or other variants. This has led to many people believing that \"donzerly\" is an actual word.\n\n\"Blinded by the Light\", a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, contains what has been called \"probably the most misheard lyric of all time\".[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/q-blinded-by-the-light-revved/ Q: \"Blinded By the Light, Revved Up Like a...\" What?] , Blogcritics Music The phrase \"revved up like a deuce\", altered from Springsteen's original \"cut loose like a deuce,\" both lyrics referring to the hot rodders slang deuce (short for deuce coupé) for a 1932 Ford coupé, is frequently misheard as \"wrapped up like a douche\".The comedy show The Vacant Lot built an entire skit, called \"Blinded by the Light,\" around four friends arguing about the lyrics. One version can be seen here:  Springsteen himself has joked about the phenomenon, claiming that it was not until Manfred Mann rewrote the song to be about a \"feminine hygiene product\" that the song became popular.\n\nA 2010 survey in Britain found that the most commonly misheard lyric was \"Call me when you try to wake her\" in R.E.M.'s \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" which was misheard as \"Calling Jamaica.\" Other misheard lyrics reported in the survey included \"See that girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen,\" from the ABBA song \"Dancing Queen\" (\"See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen\").\n\nRap and hip hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard pronunciations. The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often regional pronunciation or non-traditional accenting of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist's stylizations and the lyrics's written structure. This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press's 2010 Anthology of Rap.[http://www.slate.com/id/2275145/ Article on Yale \"Anthology of Rap\" lyrics controversies], Slate.com, 2010. For example, in the 2015 song \"Post To Be\" by Omarion ft. Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Aiko's lyric \"I might have that nigga sailing his soul for me\" was widely misheard as \"selling his soul\" but it was really  a play on the title of Aiko's mixtape Sailing Soul(s).[https://genius.com/4350212 Omarion Ft. Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko - Post To Be] genius.com Accessed 7/24/2017\n\nStandardized and recorded mondegreens \n\nSometimes, the modified version of a lyric becomes standard, as is the case with \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The original has \"four colly birds\" (colly means black; cf. A Midsummer Night's Dream: \"Brief as the lightning in the collied night.\"); sometime around the turn of the twentieth century, these became calling birds, which is the lyric used in the 1909 Frederic Austin version.\n\nA number of misheard lyrics have been recorded, turning a mondegreen into a real title. The song \"Sea Lion Woman\", recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp, was performed by Nina Simone under the title \"See Line Woman\". According to the liner notes from the compilation A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings, the actual title of this playground song might also be \"See [the] Lyin' Woman\" or \"C-Line Woman\". Jack Lawrence's misinterpretation of the French phrase \"pauvre Jean\" (\"poor John\") as the identically pronounced \"pauvres gens\" (\"poor people\") led to the translation of La Goualante du pauvre Jean (\"The Ballad of Poor John\") as \"The Poor People of Paris\", a hit song in 1956.[http://www.jacklawrencesongwriter.com/songs/poor_people_of_paris.html Jack Lawrence, Songwriter: Poor People Of Paris] \n\nIn literature\n\nThe title of J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is often mistaken for a mondegreen.  The main character, Holden Caulfield, misremembers a sung version of the Robert Burns poem \"Comin' Thro' the Rye\": the line \"Gin a body meet a body / comin' through the rye\" is recalled as \"Gin a body catch a body / comin' through the rye.\"  This is not a mondegreen, but a result of a confabulation in Holden's psyche in line with the theme of the novel.\n\nA Monk Swimming by author Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. \"Amongst women\" became \"a monk swimmin'\".\n\nThe title and plot of the short sci-fi story \"Come You Nigh: Kay Shuns\" (\"Com-mu-ni-ca-tions\") by Lawrence A. Perkins, in Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine (April 1970), deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens.\n\nIn Beverly Cleary's children's book Ramona the Pest, Ramona mishears \"by the dawn's early light\" as \"by the dawnzer lee light\" and concludes that a \"dawnzer\" must be a kind of lamp.\n\nIn film\n\nA monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film Carnal Knowledge. The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child, including \"Round John Virgin\" (instead of '\"Round yon virgin...\") and \"Gladly, the cross-eyed bear\".\n\nThe enigmatic title of the 2013 film Ain't Them Bodies Saints is actually a misheard lyric from a folk song; director David Lowery decided to use it because it evoked the \"classical, regional\" feel of 1970s rural Texas. (in the article text, not the video)\n\nIn television\n\n\"Mondegreens\" was the name of a segment on the Australian music quiz show Spicks and Specks (ABC TV).\n\nMondegreens have been used in many television advertising campaigns, including:\n* An advertisement for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat touting the car's audio system shows a number of people singing incorrect versions of the line \"Burning out his fuse up here alone\" from the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song \"Rocket Man\", until a woman listening to the song in a Passat realizes the correct words.\n* A series of advertisements for Maxell audio cassette tapes, produced by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, shown in 1989 and 1990, featured misheard versions of \"Israelites\" (e.g., \"Me ears are alight\") by Desmond Dekker and \"Into the Valley\" by The Skids as heard by users of other brands of tape.\n* A 1987 series of advertisements for Kellogg's Nut 'n Honey Crunch featured a joke in which one person asks \"What's for breakfast?\" and is told \"Nut 'N' Honey,\" which is misheard as \"Nothing, honey.\"\n\nOther examples\n\nThe traditional game Chinese whispers (\"Telephone\" in the United States) involves mishearing a whispered sentence to produce a mondegreen.\n\nAmong schoolchildren in the U.S., daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens. or, for instance: \"...And to the republic; For which it stands; One nation underdog; With liver, tea, and justice for all.\" The main character Shirley recites, \"I pledge a lesson to the frog of the United States of America, and to the wee puppet for witches’ hands. One Asian, in the vestibule, with little tea and just rice for all.\" Note that \"under God\" is missing because it was added in the 1950s, whereas the novel is set in 1947.\n\nNon-English languages\n\n;Dutch\nIn Dutch, mondegreens are popularly referred to as Mama appelsap (\"Mommy applejuice\"), from the Michael Jackson song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' which features the lyrics Mama-se mama-sa ma-ma-coo-sa, and was once misheard as Mama say mama sa mam[a]appelsap. The Dutch radio station 3FM had a show Superrradio (originally Timur Open Radio) run by Timur Perlin and Ramon with an item in which listeners were encouraged send in mondegreens under the name \"Mama appelsap\". The segment was popular for years. \n\n;French\nThe title of the film La Vie en rose depicting the life of Édith Piaf can be mistaken for \"L'Avion rose\" (The pink airplane).\n\nThe French word \"lapalissade\", designating a gross truism or platitude, is derived from the name of Jacques II de Chabannes, Seigneur de La Palice, because of a misread mondegreen in a mourning song written just after his heroic death. Reading an \"f\" as a long \"s\" (ſ), \"s’il n’était pas mort, il ferait encore envie\" (\"if he were not dead, he would still arouse envy\") becomes \"il serait encore en vie\" (\"he would still be alive\"). This truism remains as the first and most well-known \"lapalissade\" in French.\n\nThe title of the 1983 French novel Le Thé au harem d'Archi Ahmed (\"Tea in the Harem of Archi Ahmed\") by Mehdi Charef (and the 1985 movie of the same name) is based on the main character mishearing le théorème d'Archimède (\"the theorem of Archimedes\") in his mathematics class.\n\nA classic example in French is similar to the \"Lady Mondegreen\" anecdote: in his 1962 collection of children's quotes La Foire aux cancres, the humorist Jean-Charles:fr:Jean-Charles refers to a misunderstood lyric of \"La Marseillaise\" (the French national anthem): \"Entendez-vous ... mugir ces féroces soldats\" (Do you hear those savage soldiers roar?) is heard as \"...Séféro, ce soldat\" (that soldier Séféro).\n\n;Hebrew\nGhil'ad Zuckermann cites the Hebrew example mukhrakhím liyót saméakh (\"we must be happy\", with a grammar mistake) instead of (the high-register) úru 'akhím belév saméakh (\"wake up, brothers, with a happy heart\"), from the well-known song \"Háva Nagíla\" (\"Let’s be happy\").Ghil'ad Zuckermann [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). . 2003, p. 248.\nThe Israeli site dedicated to Hebrew mondegreens has coined the term \"avatiach\" (Hebrew for watermelon) for \"mondegreen\", named for a common mishearing of Shlomo Artzi's award-winning 1970 song \"Ahavtia\" (\"I loved her\", using a form uncommon in spoken Hebrew).[http://www.avatiach.com/ Avatiach - Hebrew mondegreens]\n\n;Polish\nA paper in phonology cites memoirs of poet Antoni Słonimski, who confessed that in the recited poem Konrad Wallenrod he used to hear \"zwierz Alpuhary\" (\"a beast of Alpujarras\") rather than \"z wież Alpuhary\" (\"from the towers of Alpujarras\").Zygmunt Saloni, [http://docplayer.pl/23928410-Transkrypcja-fonologiczna-tekstu-polskiego-w-praktyce-uniwersyteckiej-1.html Transkrypcja fonologiczna tekstu polskiego w praktyce uniwersyteckiej], Język Polski, vol. XCV, issue 4, 2015, pp. 325-332\n\n;Portuguese\nThe most well-known mondegreen in Brazil is in the song \"Noite do Prazer\" (Night of Pleasure) by Claudio Zoli: the line \"Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, tocando B. B. King sem parar\" (At dawn the phonograph playing a blues, playing B. B. King nonstop), is often misheard as \"Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, trocando de biquini sem parar\" (at dawn the phonograph playing a blues, [people are] exchanging bikini nonstop).\n\n;Russian\nRussian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, in 1875, cited a line from Fyodor Glinka's song \"Troika\" (1825) \"колокольчик, дар Валдая\" (\"the bell, gift of Valday\") claiming that it is usually understood as \"колокольчик, дарвалдая\" (\"the bell darvaldaying\" — supposedly an onomatopoeia of ringing).\n\n;Turkish\nIn Turkey, the political Democratic Party changed its logo in 2007 to a white horse in front of a red background because many voters mispronounced its Turkish name Demokrat, instead saying demir kırat (\"iron white-horse\").\n\nReverse mondegreen\n\nA reverse mondegreen is the intentional production, in speech or writing, of words or phrases that seem to be gibberish but disguise meaning. A prominent example is Mairzy Doats, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. The lyrics are a reverse mondegreen, made up of oronyms, so pronounced (and written) as to challenge the listener (or reader) to interpret them: \n\n:Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey\n:A kiddley divey too, wooden shoe\n\nThe clue to the meaning is contained in the bridge:\n\n:If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,\n:Sing \"Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.\"\n\nWith that clue, the listener can figure out that the last line is \"a kid'll eat ivy, too; wouldn't you?\"\n\nOther examples include:\n*Iron Butterfly's 1968 hit, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", a reverse mondegreen of the phrase \"In the Garden of Eden\", which, according to liner notes, was going to be the song's title.\n*Sly and the Family Stone's 1970 hit, \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\", in which the part after thank you is an obvious reverse mondegreen for \"for lettin' me be myself again.\" \n*In the 1945 comedy-mystery film Murder, He Says, a character repeats a reverse mondegreen that contains a clue to finding some lost money: \"Honors flyzis, income beezis, onches nobbis, innob keezis.\"\n* In his Anguish Languish (English language), Howard L. Chace uses standard English words in non-standard order to create reverse mondegreens that refer to familiar things and stories; it includes the widely known story \"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\" (Little Red Riding Hood).\n* Many songs by Animal Collective feature reverse mondegreens in their titles, including \"Mouth Wooed Her\" (\"Mouth Water\"), \"Seal Eyeing\" (\"Sea Lion\"), and \"Brother Sport\" (\"Brother Support\").\n\nDeliberate mondegreen\n\nTwo authors have written books of supposed foreign-language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English. Luis van Rooten's pseudo-French Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames includes critical, historical, and interpretive apparatus, as does John Hulme's Mörder Guss Reims, attributed to a fictitious German poet. Both titles sound like the phrase \"Mother Goose Rhymes\". Both works can also be considered soramimi, which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon \"Difficile Lectu\" (written c. 1786-87, when he was 30 or 31), which, though ostensibly in Latin, is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian.Hocquard, Jean-Victor (1999) Mozart ou la voix du comique. Maisonneuve & Larose, p. 203.\n\nSome performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres. The phrase \"if you see Kay\" (F-U-C-K) has been employed many times, notably as a line from James Joyce's 1922 novel Ulysses and in many songs, including by blues pianist Memphis Slim in 1963, R. Stevie Moore in 1977, April Wine on its 1982 album Power Play, the Poster Children via their Daisy Chain Reaction in 1991, Turbonegro in 2005, Aerosmith in \"Devil's Got a New Disguise\" in 2006, and The Script in their 2008 song \"If You See Kay\". Britney Spears did the same thing with the song \"If U Seek Amy\". A similar effect was created in Hindi in the 2011 Bollywood movie Delhi Belly in the song \"Bhaag D.K. Bose\". While \"D. K. Bose\" appears to be a person's name, it is sung repeatedly in the chorus to form the deliberate mondegreen \"bhosadi ke\" (Hindi: भोसडी के), a Hindi expletive.\n\n\"Mondegreen\" is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album, Odd Blood. The lyrics are intentionally obscure (for instance, \"Everybody sugar in my bed\" and \"Perhaps the pollen in the air turns us into a stapler\") and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect.",

Carroll and many others quote it as \"Gladly the cross I'd bear\"; They Might Be Giants allude to this line and its mishearing in their title album's song \"Hide Away, Folk Family\", which contains the line \"And sadly the cross-eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs\". \n# There's a bathroom on the right (the line at the end of each verse of \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival: \"There's a bad moon on the rise\").\n# Scuse me while I kiss this guy (from a lyric in the song \"Purple Haze\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"'Scuse me while I kiss the sky\").\n\nBoth Creedence's John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the \"mondegreen\" versions of their songs in concert.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/26/leadersandreply.mainsection2 Letters], The Guardian, 26 April 2007.This can be heard on his 1998 live album Premonition. [http://www.superseventies.com/faq_ccr.html CCR/John Fogerty FAQ] at superseventies.com.\n\nThe national anthem of the United States is highly susceptible (especially for young grade-school students) to the creation of mondegreens, two in the first line. Francis Scott Key's Star-Spangled Banner begins with the line \"O say can you see, by the dawn's early light.\"Francis Scott Key, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html The Star Spangled Banner] (lyrics), 1814, MENC: The National Association for Music Education National Anthem Project (archived from [http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html the original] [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html Archived] January 26, 2013, at the Wayback Machine. on 2013-01-26). This has been accidentally and deliberately misinterpreted as \"Jose, can you see,\" another example of the Hobson-Jobson effect, countless times. The second half of the line has been misheard as well, as \"by the donzerly light,\" or other variants. This has led to many people believing that \"donzerly\" is an actual word.\n\n\"Blinded by the Light\", a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, contains what has been called \"probably the most misheard lyric of all time\".[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/q-blinded-by-the-light-revved/ Q: \"Blinded By the Light, Revved Up Like a...\" What?] , Blogcritics Music The phrase \"revved up like a deuce\", altered from Springsteen's original \"cut loose like a deuce,\" both lyrics referring to the hot rodders slang deuce (short for deuce coupé) for a 1932 Ford coupé, is frequently misheard as \"wrapped up like a douche\".The comedy show The Vacant Lot built an entire skit, called \"Blinded by the Light,\" around four friends arguing about the lyrics. One version can be seen here:  Springsteen himself has joked about the phenomenon, claiming that it was not until Manfred Mann rewrote the song to be about a \"feminine hygiene product\" that the song became popular.\n\nA 2010 survey in Britain found that the most commonly misheard lyric was \"Call me when you try to wake her\" in R.E.M.'s \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" which was misheard as \"Calling Jamaica.\" Other misheard lyrics reported in the survey included \"See that girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen,\" from the ABBA song \"Dancing Queen\" (\"See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen\").\n\nRap and hip hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard pronunciations. The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often regional pronunciation or non-traditional accenting of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist's stylizations and the lyrics's written structure. This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press's 2010 Anthology of Rap.[http://www.slate.com/id/2275145/ Article on Yale \"Anthology of Rap\" lyrics controversies], Slate.com, 2010. For example, in the 2015 song \"Post To Be\" by Omarion ft. Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Aiko's lyric \"I might have that nigga sailing his soul for me\" was widely misheard as \"selling his soul\" but it was really  a play on the title of Aiko's mixtape Sailing Soul(s).[https://genius.com/4350212 Omarion Ft. Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko - Post To Be] genius.com Accessed 7/24/2017\n\nStandardized and recorded mondegreens \n\nSometimes, the modified version of a lyric becomes standard, as is the case with \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The original has \"four colly birds\" (colly means black; cf. A Midsummer Night's Dream: \"Brief as the lightning in the collied night.\"); sometime around the turn of the twentieth century, these became calling birds, which is the lyric used in the 1909 Frederic Austin version.\n\nA number of misheard lyrics have been recorded, turning a mondegreen into a real title. The song \"Sea Lion Woman\", recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp, was performed by Nina Simone under the title \"See Line Woman\". According to the liner notes from the compilation A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings, the actual title of this playground song might also be \"See [the] Lyin' Woman\" or \"C-Line Woman\". Jack Lawrence's misinterpretation of the French phrase \"pauvre Jean\" (\"poor John\") as the identically pronounced \"pauvres gens\" (\"poor people\") led to the translation of La Goualante du pauvre Jean (\"The Ballad of Poor John\") as \"The Poor People of Paris\", a hit song in 1956.[http://www.jacklawrencesongwriter.com/songs/poor_people_of_paris.html Jack Lawrence, Songwriter: Poor People Of Paris] \n\nIn literature\n\nThe title of J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is often mistaken for a mondegreen.  The main character, Holden Caulfield, misremembers a sung version of the Robert Burns poem \"Comin' Thro' the Rye\": the line \"Gin a body meet a body / comin' through the rye\" is recalled as \"Gin a body catch a body / comin' through the rye.\"  This is not a mondegreen, but a result of a confabulation in Holden's psyche in line with the theme of the novel.\n\nA Monk Swimming by author Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. \"Amongst women\" became \"a monk swimmin'\".\n\nThe title and plot of the short sci-fi story \"Come You Nigh: Kay Shuns\" (\"Com-mu-ni-ca-tions\") by Lawrence A. Perkins, in Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine (April 1970), deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens.\n\nIn Beverly Cleary's children's book Ramona the Pest, Ramona mishears \"by the dawn's early light\" as \"by the dawnzer lee light\" and concludes that a \"dawnzer\" must be a kind of lamp.\n\nIn film\n\nA monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film Carnal Knowledge. The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child, including \"Round John Virgin\" (instead of '\"Round yon virgin...\") and \"Gladly, the cross-eyed bear\".\n\nThe enigmatic title of the 2013 film Ain't Them Bodies Saints is actually a misheard lyric from a folk song; director David Lowery decided to use it because it evoked the \"classical, regional\" feel of 1970s rural Texas. (in the article text, not the video)\n\nIn television\n\n\"Mondegreens\" was the name of a segment on the Australian music quiz show Spicks and Specks (ABC TV).\n\nMondegreens have been used in many television advertising campaigns, including:\n* An advertisement for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat touting the car's audio system shows a number of people singing incorrect versions of the line \"Burning out his fuse up here alone\" from the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song \"Rocket Man\", until a woman listening to the song in a Passat realizes the correct words.\n* A series of advertisements for Maxell audio cassette tapes, produced by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, shown in 1989 and 1990, featured misheard versions of \"Israelites\" (e.g., \"Me ears are alight\") by Desmond Dekker and \"Into the Valley\" by The Skids as heard by users of other brands of tape.\n* A 1987 series of advertisements for Kellogg's Nut 'n Honey Crunch featured a joke in which one person asks \"What's for breakfast?\" and is told \"Nut 'N' Honey,\" which is misheard as \"Nothing, honey.\"\n\nOther examples\n\nThe traditional game Chinese whispers (\"Telephone\" in the United States) involves mishearing a whispered sentence to produce a mondegreen.\n\nAmong schoolchildren in the U.S., daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens. or, for instance: \"...And to the republic; For which it stands; One nation underdog; With liver, tea, and justice for all.\" The main character Shirley recites, \"I pledge a lesson to the frog of the United States of America, and to the wee puppet for witches’ hands. One Asian, in the vestibule, with little tea and just rice for all.\" Note that \"under God\" is missing because it was added in the 1950s, whereas the novel is set in 1947.\n\nNon-English languages\n\n;Dutch\nIn Dutch, mondegreens are popularly referred to as Mama appelsap (\"Mommy applejuice\"), from the Michael Jackson song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' which features the lyrics Mama-se mama-sa ma-ma-coo-sa, and was once misheard as Mama say mama sa mam[a]appelsap. The Dutch radio station 3FM had a show Superrradio (originally Timur Open Radio) run by Timur Perlin and Ramon with an item in which listeners were encouraged send in mondegreens under the name \"Mama appelsap\". The segment was popular for years. \n\n;French\nThe title of the film La Vie en rose depicting the life of Édith Piaf can be mistaken for \"L'Avion rose\" (The pink airplane).\n\nThe French word \"lapalissade\", designating a gross truism or platitude, is derived from the name of Jacques II de Chabannes, Seigneur de La Palice, because of a misread mondegreen in a mourning song written just after his heroic death. Reading an \"f\" as a long \"s\" (ſ), \"s’il n’était pas mort, il ferait encore envie\" (\"if he were not dead, he would still arouse envy\") becomes \"il serait encore en vie\" (\"he would still be alive\"). This truism remains as the first and most well-known \"lapalissade\" in French.\n\nThe title of the 1983 French novel Le Thé au harem d'Archi Ahmed (\"Tea in the Harem of Archi Ahmed\") by Mehdi Charef (and the 1985 movie of the same name) is based on the main character mishearing le théorème d'Archimède (\"the theorem of Archimedes\") in his mathematics class.\n\nA classic example in French is similar to the \"Lady Mondegreen\" anecdote: in his 1962 collection of children's quotes La Foire aux cancres, the humorist Jean-Charles:fr:Jean-Charles refers to a misunderstood lyric of \"La Marseillaise\" (the French national anthem): \"Entendez-vous ... mugir ces féroces soldats\" (Do you hear those savage soldiers roar?) is heard as \"...Séféro, ce soldat\" (that soldier Séféro).\n\n;Hebrew\nGhil'ad Zuckermann cites the Hebrew example mukhrakhím liyót saméakh (\"we must be happy\", with a grammar mistake) instead of (the high-register) úru 'akhím belév saméakh (\"wake up, brothers, with a happy heart\"), from the well-known song \"Háva Nagíla\" (\"Let’s be happy\").Ghil'ad Zuckermann [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). . 2003, p. 248.\nThe Israeli site dedicated to Hebrew mondegreens has coined the term \"avatiach\" (Hebrew for watermelon) for \"mondegreen\", named for a common mishearing of Shlomo Artzi's award-winning 1970 song \"Ahavtia\" (\"I loved her\", using a form uncommon in spoken Hebrew).[http://www.avatiach.com/ Avatiach - Hebrew mondegreens]\n\n;Polish\nA paper in phonology cites memoirs of poet Antoni Słonimski, who confessed that in the recited poem Konrad Wallenrod he used to hear \"zwierz Alpuhary\" (\"a beast of Alpujarras\") rather than \"z wież Alpuhary\" (\"from the towers of Alpujarras\").Zygmunt Saloni, [http://docplayer.pl/23928410-Transkrypcja-fonologiczna-tekstu-polskiego-w-praktyce-uniwersyteckiej-1.html Transkrypcja fonologiczna tekstu polskiego w praktyce uniwersyteckiej], Język Polski, vol. XCV, issue 4, 2015, pp. 325-332\n\n;Portuguese\nThe most well-known mondegreen in Brazil is in the song \"Noite do Prazer\" (Night of Pleasure) by Claudio Zoli: the line \"Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, tocando B. B. King sem parar\" (At dawn the phonograph playing a blues, playing B. B. King nonstop), is often misheard as \"Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, trocando de biquini sem parar\" (at dawn the phonograph playing a blues, [people are] exchanging bikini nonstop).\n\n;Russian\nRussian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, in 1875, cited a line from Fyodor Glinka's song \"Troika\" (1825) \"колокольчик, дар Валдая\" (\"the bell, gift of Valday\") claiming that it is usually understood as \"колокольчик, дарвалдая\" (\"the bell darvaldaying\" — supposedly an onomatopoeia of ringing).\n\n;Turkish\nIn Turkey, the political Democratic Party changed its logo in 2007 to a white horse in front of a red background because many voters mispronounced its Turkish name Demokrat, instead saying demir kırat (\"iron white-horse\").\n\nReverse mondegreen\n\nA reverse mondegreen is the intentional production, in speech or writing, of words or phrases that seem to be gibberish but disguise meaning. A prominent example is Mairzy Doats, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. The lyrics are a reverse mondegreen, made up of oronyms, so pronounced (and written) as to challenge the listener (or reader) to interpret them: \n\n:Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey\n:A kiddley divey too, wooden shoe\n\nThe clue to the meaning is contained in the bridge:\n\n:If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,\n:Sing \"Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.\"\n\nWith that clue, the listener can figure out that the last line is \"a kid'll eat ivy, too; wouldn't you?\"\n\nOther examples include:\n*Iron Butterfly's 1968 hit, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", a reverse mondegreen of the phrase \"In the Garden of Eden\", which, according to liner notes, was going to be the song's title.\n*Sly and the Family Stone's 1970 hit, \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\", in which the part after thank you is an obvious reverse mondegreen for \"for lettin' me be myself again.\" \n*In the 1945 comedy-mystery film Murder, He Says, a character repeats a reverse mondegreen that contains a clue to finding some lost money: \"Honors flyzis, income beezis, onches nobbis, innob keezis.\"\n* In his Anguish Languish (English language), Howard L. Chace uses standard English words in non-standard order to create reverse mondegreens that refer to familiar things and stories; it includes the widely known story \"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\" (Little Red Riding Hood).\n* Many songs by Animal Collective feature reverse mondegreens in their titles, including \"Mouth Wooed Her\" (\"Mouth Water\"), \"Seal Eyeing\" (\"Sea Lion\"), and \"Brother Sport\" (\"Brother Support\").\n\nDeliberate mondegreen\n\nTwo authors have written books of supposed foreign-language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English. Luis van Rooten's pseudo-French Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames includes critical, historical, and interpretive apparatus, as does John Hulme's Mörder Guss Reims, attributed to a fictitious German poet. Both titles sound like the phrase \"Mother Goose Rhymes\". Both works can also be considered soramimi, which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon \"Difficile Lectu\" (written c. 1786-87, when he was 30 or 31), which, though ostensibly in Latin, is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian.Hocquard, Jean-Victor (1999) Mozart ou la voix du comique. Maisonneuve & Larose, p. 203.\n\nSome performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres. The phrase \"if you see Kay\" (F-U-C-K) has been employed many times, notably as a line from James Joyce's 1922 novel Ulysses and in many songs, including by blues pianist Memphis Slim in 1963, R. Stevie Moore in 1977, April Wine on its 1982 album Power Play, the Poster Children via their Daisy Chain Reaction in 1991, Turbonegro in 2005, Aerosmith in \"Devil's Got a New Disguise\" in 2006, and The Script in their 2008 song \"If You See Kay\". Britney Spears did the same thing with the song \"If U Seek Amy\". A similar effect was created in Hindi in the 2011 Bollywood movie Delhi Belly in the song \"Bhaag D.K. Bose\". While \"D. K. Bose\" appears to be a person's name, it is sung repeatedly in the chorus to form the deliberate mondegreen \"bhosadi ke\" (Hindi: भोसडी के), a Hindi expletive.\n\n\"Mondegreen\" is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album, Odd Blood. The lyrics are intentionally obscure (for instance, \"Everybody sugar in my bed\" and \"Perhaps the pollen in the air turns us into a stapler\") and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect.
