  "textBody" : "There are a number of transport services around the Isle of Man, mostly consisting of paved roads, public transport, rail services, sea ports and an airport.\n\nRoads\n\nThe island has a total of 688 mi of public roads, all of which are paved. Roads are numbered using a numbering scheme similar to the numbering schemes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; each road is assigned a letter, which represents the road's category, followed by a 1 or 2 digit number. A roads are the main roads of the island whilst roads labelled B, C, D or U decrease in size and/or quality. (The C, D and U numbers are not marked on most maps or on signposts.) There is no national speed limit - some roads may be driven at any speed which is safe and appropriate. Careless and dangerous driving laws still apply, so one may not drive at absolutely any speed, and there are local speed limits on many roads. Many unrestricted roads have frequent bends which even the most experienced driver cannot see round. Measured travel speeds (see table below) are often relatively low. Drivers are limited to 50 mph in the first two years after passing their driving test (Isle of Man citizens are permitted to start driving at the age of sixteen) and some are not used to having to make progress in the same way as on a larger road network such as that in the UK: even a cautious driver can get from anywhere in the island to anywhere else in ninety minutes).\n\nSet against this is a strong culture of motor sport enthusiasm (pinnacled in the TT, but there are many events during the year) and many residents familiar with the roads are well used to traversing country roads at speeds illegal on similar roads elsewhere. This leads to a very diverse level of both driving competence and speed. In an official survey in 2006 the introduction of blanket speed limits was refused by the population, suggesting that a large number appreciate the freedom.\n\nThere is a comprehensive bus network, operated by Bus Vannin, a department of the Isle of Man Government, with most routes originating or terminating in Douglas.\n\nRailways\n\nThe island has a total of  of railway, of which  is electrified. There are seven separate rail or tram systems on the island:\n\n*Isle of Man Railway - operated by Department of Infrastructure\n*Manx Electric Railway -  operated by Department of Infrastructure\n*Snaefell Mountain Railway -  operated by Department of Infrastructure\n*Douglas Horse Tram - operated by the Douglas Borough Council\n*Groudle Glen Railway - operated by Groudle Glen Railway (2012) Limited\n*Great Laxey Mine Railway - operated by the Laxey & Lonan Heritage Trust\n*The Orchid Line - operated by the Manx Steam & Model Engineering Club\n\n(The last three are short-distance tourist rides which cannot be said to be transport services.)\n\nMost or all of these routes are seasonal.\n\nAirports\n\nThe only commercial airport on the island is the Isle of Man Airport at Ronaldsway. Scheduled services operate to and from various cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, operated by several different airlines.\n\nThe island's other paved runways are at Jurby and Andreas.  Jurby remains in Isle of Man Government ownership and is used for motorsport events and, previously, airshows, while Andreas is privately owned and used by a local glider club.  The old Hall Caine Airport, a grass field near Ramsey, is no longer used.\n\nAircraft Register\n\nThe Isle of Man Aircraft Register became operational on 1 May 2007. The register is open to all non-commercial aircraft and is intended to be of particular interest to professionally flown corporate operators.\nAs of November 2012 a total of 537 corporate and private aircraft had been registered.\n\nPorts and harbours\n\nPorts are located at Castletown, Douglas, Peel and Ramsey. Douglas is served by frequent ferries to and from United Kingdom and Ireland; the sole operator is the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company with exclusive use of the Isle of Man Sea Terminal, and the Douglas port linkspans under the conditions of the user agreement negotiated with the Isle of Man Government.\n\nMerchant marine\n\nThe Isle of Man register comprises 226 ships of 1,000 GRT or over, totalling 6,055,436 GRT or . This figure includes some foreign-owned ships registered on the Island as a flag of convenience: Australia, 3; Cyprus, 4; Denmark, 30; Estonia, 3; France, 1; Germany, 57; Greece, 8; Hong Kong, 11; Iceland, 1; Italy, 6; Monaco, 4; Netherlands, 2; New Zealand, 1; Norway, 10; Singapore, 2; Sweden, 3; United Kingdom, 80; United States, 1.\n \nA breakdown of ships by type: bulk, 25; cargo, 40; chemical tanker, 25; combination bulk, 2; container, 19; liquefied gas, 31; multi-functional large load carrier, 1; petroleum tanker, 59; refrigerated cargo, 1; roll on/roll off, 17; specialised tanker, 1; vehicle carrier, 5.",
