  "textBody" : "Gary Kilgore North (born February 1942) is an American paleolibertarian writer, Austrian School economic historian, and leading figure in the Christian Reconstructionist movement.  North has authored or coauthored over fifty books on topics including Reformed Protestant theology, economics, and history. He is an Associated Scholar of the Ludwig von Mises Institute.\n\nHe is known for his advocacy of biblical or \"radically libertarian\" economics and also as a theorist of dominionism and theonomy. He supports the establishment and enforcement of Bible-based religious law, a view which has put him in conflict with other libertarians. Particularly controversial are his views on capital punishment, which he believes is appropriate punishment for male homosexuality, adultery, blasphemy, and a wide variety of other crimes.\n\nEducation and background\n\nNorth grew up in southern California, the son of FBI special agent Samuel W. North, Jr., and his wife, Peggy. North converted to Christianity in high school and began frequenting conservative book-stores in the Los Angeles area during his college years.  Between 1961 and 1963, while an undergraduate student at University of California, Riverside, North became acquainted with the works of Wilhelm Röpke, Rose Wilder Lane, Cornelius Van Til, Austrian School economists Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Murray Rothbard, and also read the works of Calvinist philosopher Rousas John Rushdoony. Later he married Rushdoony's daughter, collaborated with him and eulogized Rushdoony in a blog post on LewRockwell.com.\n\nCareer\n\nStarting in 1967, North became a contributor to the libertarian journal The Freeman where he had first read the work of Ludwig Von Mises and Friedrich Hayek.. In the 1970s, he was the director of seminars for the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). North received a Ph.D. in history from the University of California, Riverside in 1972. His dissertation was The Concept of Property in Puritan New England, 1630–1720.\n\nHe served as research assistant for libertarian Republican Congressman Ron Paul in Paul's first term (1976). North is a regular contributor to the   LewRockwell.com website, which lists an extensive archive of his articles there.[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north-arch.html LewRockwell.com Articles by North] North's own website, Garynorth.com, posts commentary on religious, social, and political issues and offers paid access to investment advice and other premium content.[http://www.garynorth.com/public/10.cfm Why You Should Join This Members-Only Community Forum], Garynorth.com, accessed July 27, 2014.

As Director of Curriculum Development, North has outlined four goals of the educational project: providing a \"detailed study\" of the \"history of liberty\"; teaching a \"thorough understanding of Austrian economics\"; serving as \"an academically rigorous curriculum that is tied to primary source\" material rather than textbooks; and teaching \"the Biblical principle of self-government and personal responsibility\", which North calls \"the foundation of the market economy\".Bump, Philip (April 9, 2013).

In his 1982 Dominion Covenant: Genesis, North wrote that mainstream modern economics, whether libertarian, conservative or liberal, is \"in disintegration\" because it is \"humanist\" in its approach and consequently rejects the notion that \"biblical revelation\" is necessary for sound economic theory. He also wrote that economics \"must begin with the [Biblical] story of creation\" if it is not to collapse into \"total chaos\".[http://www.garynorth.com/freebooks/docs/2222_47e.htm Dominion Covenant: Genesis], Institute for Christian Economics, June 1982.\n\nProposed \"Christian theocratic\" political and social order\n\nA 2011 New York Times article identified North as a central figure in Christian Reconstructionism, the philosophy which advocates the institution of \"a Christian theocracy under Old Testament law [as] the best form of government, and a radically libertarian one.\" North has written: \"I certainly believe in biblical theocracy.\"Hugh B. Urban, The Secrets of the Kingdom: Religion and Concealment in the Bush Administration Rowman and Littlefield, 56Gary North, Political Polytheism: The Myth of Pluralism Tyler, Tex., Institute for Christian Economics, 1989, x\n\nThe article also described North as \"the leading proponent of 'Christian economics,' which applies biblical principles to economic issues and the free market.\" North supports the abolition of the fractional-reserve banking system and a return to the gold standard. According to the Times, North believes that the Bible forbids inflation, welfare programs, and also writes that \"God would prefer gold money to paper\".\n\nRange of capital offenses\n\nNorth favors capital punishment for a range of offenders, including murderers, blasphemers, children who curse their parents,On the subject of executing children, North has written \"When people curse their parents,\nit unquestionably is a capital crime... The integrity of the family must be maintained by the threat of death\".

North stated that the biblical admonition to kill homosexuals in Leviticus is God's \"law and its morally appropriate sanction\", arguing that \"God is indeed a homophobe\" who \"hates the practice [of homosexuality] and those who practice it\" and \"hates the sin and hates the sinner.\"Gary North, [http://www.garynorth.com/Leviticus-v1.pdf Boundaries and Dominion: An Economic Commentary on Leviticus], (2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. xxvi; 221), 1999.\n\nNorth has said that capital punishment should be carried out by stoning, because it is the biblically approved method of execution and it is cheap due to the plentiful and convenient supply of stones.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nNorth said: \"We must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality, no neutral law, no neutral education, and no neutral civil government. Then they will get busy in constructing a Bible-based social, political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of God.\"[http://reason.com/archives/1998/11/01/invitation-to-a-stoning \"Invitation to a Stoning: Getting cozy with theocrats\"] by Walter Olson, Reason, November 1998, pages 1 and 2\n\nAdam C. English suggests that this quote implies that \"religious liberty is a useful tool to Christians in the present, yet is ultimately to be denied to anyone who is not Christian once the Christians are in power\". English argues that although this may seem inconsistent (advocating religious liberty but denying the reality of the notion), North and his fellow Reconstructionists understand \"liberty\" in a theological sense. According to the Reconstructionists, \"anyone outside of the Christian faith is in bondage,\" and so \"government by rigorous theonomy is not oppressive but liberating\".English, \"Christian Reconstruction after Y2K,\" p. 117.\n\nY2K\n\nNorth was also a prominent promoter of the Y2K scare during the late 1990s,[https://www.forbes.com/1998/05/01/feat.html\"Year 2000 Survivalists,\" Forbes][http://www.arktimes.com/StreetJazz/archives/2012/04/04/the-doomsday-seekers-a-look-at-christian-reconstructionism\"The Doomsday Seekers, Arkansas Times][http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Some-Perspective-5-Years-After-Y2K\"Some Perspecttives 5 Years After Y2K,\" \"eWeek\"][http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/01/33445\"Y2K Alarmist: Wha' Happened\" \"Wired\"] earning him the nickname \"Scary Gary.\" His main Web site became dominated by links to extremist predictions for Y2K damage, including widespread collapse of governments, financial institutions and more. North declared on his home page that Y2K \"may be the biggest problem that the modern world has ever faced\" and labeled 2000 as \"The Year the Earth Stands Still\".[http://y2klibrary.tripod.com\"Gary North's Y2K Links and Forums\" (archived)]\n\nCritics said the motivation for North's predictions was linked to his Christian Reconstructionist aims, which require widespread societal collapse to set the stage for a new theocratic order. North made the connection explicit in communications with fellow Reconstructionists: \"The Y2K crisis is systemic. It cannot possibly be fixed. I think it will wipe out every national government in the West. Not just modify them—destroy them...That is what I have wanted all my adult life.
