These systems faced initial skepticism, based on the assumption that applications do not have significant parallelism, because of Amdahl's law, but the success of early systems such as nCUBE and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following Moore's law led to a fast replacement.\n\nTaken from the title of Eugene Brooks' (of Lawrence Livermore Lab) talk  \"Attack of the Killer Micros\" at Supercomputing 1990.
