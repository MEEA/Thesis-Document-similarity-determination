In the Introduction I wrote that dukkha is probably best understood as unsatisfactoriness.\", Quote: \"(...) the three characteristics of samsara/sankhara (the realm of rebirth): anicca (impermance), dukkha (pain) and anatta (no-self).\" It refers to the fundamental unsatisfactoriness and painfulness of mundane life. It is the first of the Four Noble Truths. The term is also found in scriptures of Hinduism, such as the Upanishads, in discussions of moksha (spiritual liberation).\n\nEtymology and meaning\n\nDukkha (Pali; Sanskrit duḥkha) is a term found in ancient Indian literature, wherein states Monier-Williams, it means anything that is \"uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness\". It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of life that innately includes the \"unpleasant\", \"suffering,\" \"pain,\" \"sorrow\", \"distress\", \"grief\" or \"misery.\" The term Dukkha does not have a one word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences. It is opposed to the word sukha, meaning \"happiness,\" \"comfort\" or \"ease.\"\n\nThe word is commonly explained as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,\n\nJoseph Goldstein, American vipassana teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:\n\nHowever, according to Monier Monier-Williams, the actual roots of the Pali term dukkha appear to be Sanskrit दुस्- (dus-, \"bad\") + स्था (stha, \"to stand\").  Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various Prakrits led to a shift from dus-sthā to duḥkha to dukkha.\n\nBuddhism\n\nContemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of dukkha. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term dukkha as \"suffering.\" Later translators have emphasized that \"suffering\" is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc. Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term \"unsatisfactoriness\" to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha. Many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.\n\nWithin the Buddhist sutras, dukkha is divided in three categories:\n* Dukkha-dukkha, the dukkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of birth, aging, illness, dying; distress from what is not desirable.\n* Viparinama-dukkha, the dukkha of the changing nature of all things. This includes the frustration of not getting what you want.\n* Sankhara-dukkha, the dukkha of conditioned experience. This includes \"a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance.\"[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi] On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.\n\nVarious sutras sum up how life in this \"mundane world\" is regarded to be dukkha, starting with samsara, the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:\n# Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, illness is dukkha, death is dukkha; \n# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha; \n# Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; \n# Not getting what is wanted is dukkha. \n# In conclusion, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.\n\nDukkha is one of the three marks of existence, namely dukkha (\"suffering\"), anatta (not-self), anicca (\"impermanence\").\n\nThe Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of dukkha, the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the Four Noble Truths.\n\nHinduism\n\nIn Hindu literature, the earliest Upaniads — the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad| and the Chandogya Upanishad| — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.  In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word dukha (दुःख) appears in the sense of \"suffering, sorrow, distress\", and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of Atman (soul, self).Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n281/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 261-262\n\nThe verse 4.4.14 of the  states:\n\nThe verse 7.26.2 of the  states:\n\nThe concept of sorrow and suffering, and self-knowledge as a means to overcome it, appears extensively with other terms in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads. The term Duhkha also appears in many other middle and later post-Buddhist Upanishads such as the verse 6.20 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, as well as in the Bhagavada Gita, all in the context of moksha. The term also appears in the foundational Sutras of the six schools of Hindu philosophy, such as the opening lines of Samkhya karika of the Samkhya school.Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/IshvarakRiShNasAnkyakArikA.pdf Samkhya karika] Compiled and indexed by Ferenc Ruzsa (2015), Sanskrit Documents Archives;Second Translation (Verse 1): Ferenc Ruzsa (1997), The triple suffering - A note on the Samkhya karika, Xth World Sanskrit Conference: Bangalore, University of Hungary, Budapest;Third Translation (all Verses): [https://archive.org/stream/hinduphilosophys00davi#page/12/mode/2up Samkhyakarika of Iswara Krishna] John Davis (Translator), Trubner, London, University of Toronto Archives[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press\n\nComparison of Buddhism and Hinduism\n\nBoth Hinduism and Buddhism emphasize that one overcomes dukha through the development of understanding.
