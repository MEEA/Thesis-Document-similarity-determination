  "textBody" : "Transport in Luxembourg is ensured principally by road, rail and air. There are also services along the River Moselle which forms the border with Germany. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with motorways to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been opened.  Trams in the capital were introduced in December 2017 and there are plans for light-rail lines in adjacent areas.  \n\nRailways \n\nOperated by Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), Luxembourg's railways form the backbone of the country's public transport network, linking the most important towns. The total length of operational (standard gauge) track is 274 km, though it was some 550 km at the end of the Second World War. There are regular services from Luxembourg City to Ettelbruck, Esch-sur-Alzette, Wasserbillig and Kleinbettingen while international routes extend to Trier, Koblenz, Brussels, Liège, Metz and Nancy.[http://www.gouvernement.lu/tout_savoir/geographie/trans.html Les transports en commun au Grand-Duché]. Retrieved 3 March 2009.\n\nThe railway network links into Belgium, Germany and France. Some of the cross-border services are run by CFL, others by SNCF, NMBS/SNCB and DB.\n\nThere is now a frequent high-speed connection to Paris via the LGV Est line. EuroCap-Rail is a proposed high-speed axis connecting Brussels, Luxembourg (city), and Strasbourg.\n\nRoads \n\nRoad network\n\nThe six Luxembourg motorways cover a total distance of 147 km, linking the capital with Trier (Germany), Thionville (France) and Arlon (Belgium) as well as with Esch-sur-Alzette and Ettelbruck in Luxembourg. Luxembourg's motorways are toll free. The speed limit is normally 130 km/h, 110 km/h in rainy weather. With 56.8 km of motorway per 1,000 km2, Luxembourg probably now has the highest density of motorways in Europe.[http://www.autostrade.it/en/studi/dossier3.html Autostrade in Europe - Data updated to 1 January 2003]. Retrieved 4 March 2009.    \n\nLuxembourg City is a major business and financial center. Many workers prefer to live in the three neighboring countries and drive to work each day. This creates huge traffic jams during peak commuting hours. Tailbacks on the E411 motorway can extend five or more kilometers into Belgium and can take an hour or more to navigate.\n\nThe remaining road network in Luxembourg accounts for a total length of 2,820 km, consisting of 798 km of trunk roads (RN or routes nationales) and 2,022 km of secondary roads (CR or chemins repris).[http://www.route2020.lu/historique/evolution_infrastructure/reseau_routier/ L'évolution du réseau routier d'ordre supérieur. Administration des Ponts et Chaussées.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.\n\nBus services\n\nComprehensive bus services linking the towns and villages of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are contracted out to private operators by the RGTR (Régime général des transports routiers) under the Ministry of Transport.[http://www.mobiliteit.lu/mobilite/transports-publics/bus/RGTR.php Les autobus RGTR from Mobilitéits Zentral.] Retrieved 4 March 2009. \n\nLuxembourg City is served by 163 of its own AVL (Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg) buses transporting some 28 million passengers per year (2007). As with the RGTR, AVL contracts out to private operators for a number of services. Most of these buses are in AVL colors but the owner's name is often mentioned on them in small print. Also, the letters on the license plate can give ownership away to those that know how that system works. There are 25 regular bus routes plus special bus services through the night.[http://www.vdl.lu/-p-1445618.html Ville de Luxembourg: Autobus.] Retrieved 4 March 2009.\n\nThe TICE or Syndicat des Tramways Intercommunaux dans le Canton d’Esch/Alzette operates several bus routes. They are centered on the city of Esch sur Alzette in the south-east of the country. Most are urban and suburban route but some extend into the surrounding countryside.[http://www.tice.lu/Tramways Intercommunaux du Canton d’Esch]. Retrieved 4 March 2009.\n\nCFL, the Luxembourg railway company, operates some 17 bus routes, mainly serving towns and villages that are no longer served by rail.[http://www.cfl.lu/CFLInternet/Espaces/01EspaceVoyageurs/06BusCFL/HorairesdeslignesdebusCFL.htm Horaires des lignes de bus CFL.] Retrieved 4 March 2009.\n\nA number of smaller cities like Ettelbruck and Wiltz have started their own local services, some of which reach out to nearby villages. These services are not part of the RGTR and national tickets are not always honored.\n\nAll transport companies work together under the Verkéiersverbond, which uses tickets for all bus and train routes. As of 2016, a ticket valid for 2 hours is 2€, whilst a one day ticket is 4€. This price also include train travel in second class for both tickets.\n\nTrams\n\nLuxembourg's historic tramway network closed in 1964 but the city reintroduced trams at the end of 2017. The phased approach will initially see trams running through the Kirchberg district to the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, before the line is eventually extended to Luxembourg railway station and the Cloche d'Or business district in the South, and Luxembourg Airport in North. Service started on a part of the route on 10 December 2017. On the same day a new funicular line opened between the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, commonly called the Pont Rouge or Red Bridge and a new station on a CFL rail line located in a valley below.  The full line will enter full operational service in 2021.\n\nWater \n\nThe River Moselle forms a 42 km natural border between Luxembourg and Germany in the south-east of the country. In the summer months, the Princess Marie-Astrid and a few other tourist boats operates regular services along the river.[http://www.moselle-tourist.lu/bateau/FR/horaires.php MS Princesse Marie-Astrid.
