  "textBody" : "\"Invictus\" is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley (1849–1903). It was written in 1875 and published in 1888 in his first volume of poems, Book of Verses, in the section Life and Death (Echoes).\n\nTitle\n\nOriginally, the poem was published with no title.  The second edition of Henley's Book of Verses added a dedication \"To R. T. H. B.\"—a reference to Robert Thomas Hamilton Bruce (1846–1899), a successful Scottish flour merchant, baker, and literary patron.\n\n The 1900 edition of Henley's Poems, published after Bruce's death, altered the dedication to \"I. M. R. T. Hamilton Bruce (1846–1899)\" (I. M. standing for \"in memoriam\").\n\nThe poem was reprinted in nineteenth-century newspapers under a variety of titles, including \"Myself\", \"Song of a Strong Soul\", \"My Soul\", \"Clear Grit\",  \"Master of His Fate\",  \"Captain of My Soul\",  \"Urbs Fortitudinis\",  and \"De Profundis\".  \n\nThe established title \"Invictus\" (Latin for \"unconquered\") was added by editor Arthur Quiller-Couch when the poem was included in The Oxford Book of English Verse (1900).\n\nText \n\nImportance \n\nIn 1875 one of Henley's legs required amputation due to complications arising from tuberculosis. Immediately after the amputation, he was told that his other leg would require a similar procedure. He chose instead to enlist the services of the distinguished English surgeon Joseph Lister, who was able to save Henley's remaining leg after multiple surgical interventions on the foot.[http://sites.google.com/site/jreedeshs/home/invictus-analysis \"Invictus analysis\"]. jreed.eshs\nWhile recovering in the infirmary, he was moved to write the verses that became \"Invictus\". This period of his life, coupled with recollections of an impoverished childhood, were primary inspirations for the poem, and play a major role in its meaning.[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-ernest-henley \"Biography of William Ernest Henley].
