Far East is often deprecated as archaic and Eurocentric, along with the terms \"Near East\" and \"Middle East\".\n\nThe term Far East came into use in European geopolitical discourse in the 12th century, denoting the Far East as the \"farthest\" of the three \"easts\", beyond the Near East and the Middle East.

In the 16th century, King John III of Portugal called India a \"rich and interesting country in the Far East (Extremo Oriente).\" The term was popularized during the period of the British Empire as a blanket term for lands to the east of British India.\n\nIn pre-World War I European geopolitics, the Near East referred to the relatively nearby lands of the Ottoman Empire, the Middle East denoted northwestern South Asia and Central Asia, and the Far East meant countries along the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean.

Reischauer, professors of East Asian Studies at Harvard University, wrote (in East Asia: The Great Tradition): \"When Europeans traveled far to the east to reach Cathay, Japan and the Indies, they naturally gave those distant regions the general name 'Far East.'
