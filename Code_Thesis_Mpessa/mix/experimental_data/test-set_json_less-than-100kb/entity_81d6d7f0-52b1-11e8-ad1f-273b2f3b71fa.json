  "textBody" : "Allan Dwan (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, née Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old, on 4 December 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician. At the University of Notre Dame, Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\nCareer\n\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\n\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938).\n\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima. He directed his last movie in 1961.\n\nHe died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\n\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDaniel Eagan of Film Journal International described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\n\nPartial filmography as director\n\n*The Gold Lust (1911)\n*The Picket Guard (1913)\n*The Restless Spirit (1913)\n*Back to Life (1913)\n*Bloodhounds of the North (1913)\n*The Lie (1914)\n*The Honor of the Mounted (1914)\n*Remember Mary Magdalen (1914)\n*Discord and Harmony (1914)\n*The Embezzler (1914)\n*The Lamb, the Woman, the Wolf (1914)\n*The End of the Feud (1914)\n*The Tragedy of Whispering Creek (1914)\n*The Unlawful Trade (1914)\n*The Forbidden Room (1914)\n*The Hopes of Blind Alley (1914)\n*Richelieu (1914)\n* Wildflower (1914)\n*A Small Town Girl (1915)\n*David Harum (1915)\n*A Girl of Yesterday (1915)\n*The Pretty Sister of Jose (1915)\n*Jordan Is a Hard Road (1915)\n*Betty of Graystone (1916)\n*The Habit of Happiness (1916)\n*The Good Bad Man (1916)\n*An Innocent Magdalene (1916)\n*The Half-Breed (1916)\n*Manhattan Madness (1916)\n*Accusing Evidence (1916)\n*Panthea (1917)\n*A Modern Musketeer (1917)\n*Bound in Morocco (1918)\n*Headin' South (1918)\n*Mr. Fix-It (1918)\n*He Comes Up Smiling (1918)\n*Cheating Cheaters (1919)\n*The Dark Star (1919)\n*Getting Mary Married (1919)\n*Soldiers of Fortune (1919)\n*In The Heart of a Fool (1920) also producer\n*The Forbidden Thing (1920) also producer\n*A Splendid Hazard (1920)\n*A Perfect Crime (1921)\n*Robin Hood (1922)\n*Zaza (1923)\n*Big Brother (1923)\n*Manhandled (1924)\n*Argentine Love (1924)\n*The Coast of Folly (1925)\n*Night Life of New York (1925)\n*Stage Struck (1925)\n*Gloria Swanson Dialogue (1925) short film made in Phonofilm for The Lambs annual \"Gambol\" held at Metropolitan Opera House\n*Padlocked (1926)\n*Sea Horses (1926)\n*Summer Bachelors (1926)\n*Tin Gods (1926)\n*French Dressing (1927)\n*The Joy Girl (1927)\n*East Side, West Side (1927)\n*The Big Noise (1928)\n*Frozen Justice (1929)\n*The Iron Mask (1929)\n*Tide of Empire (1929)\n*The Far Call (1929)\n*What a Widow!
