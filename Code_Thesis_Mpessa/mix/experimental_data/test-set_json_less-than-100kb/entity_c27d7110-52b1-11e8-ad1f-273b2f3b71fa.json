  "textBody" : "An alphabet song is any of various songs used to teach children the alphabet. Alphabet songs typically recite the names of all letters of the alphabet of a given language in order. \n\nThe A.B.C. (Verse 1) \n\n\"The A.B.C.\" or \"A.B.Cs\" is one of the best-known English language alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as \"the alphabet song\", especially in the United States.\n\nThe song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the Boston-based music publisher Charles Bradlee, and given the title \"The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte\". The musical arrangement was attributed to Louis Le Maire (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was \"Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts\", according to the Newberry Library, which also says, \"The theme is that used by Mozart for his piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman.\"The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, \"The Schoolmaster\", but the first line of that song is given as \"Come, come my children, I must see\", in [http://orbis.library.yale.edu Yale University's library catalog].  It is described as \"a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club.\" This tune is the same as the tune for  \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" and \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\".\n\nLyrics: (each line represents two measures, or eight beats)\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G...\nH, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P... (; \"L, M, N, O\" spoken twice as quickly as rest of rhyme)\nQ, R, S.../ T, U, V... (; pause between S and T)\nW... X.../ Y and Z. (; pause between X and Y, and W and X last for two beats)\nNow, I know my ABCs.\nNext time, won't you sing with me?.\n\nBackwards Alphabet \n\nThis is a version that goes Z to A instead of A to Z.\nz-y-x, w\nv-u-t, s-r-q\np-o-n-m-l-k-j\ni-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-a\nNow you know your ZYX's\nI bet that's not what you expected!\nThe e-d-c-b part is as fast as the l-m-n-o part in the normal alphabet song.\n\nZed for Zee \n\nIn the United States, Z is pronounced zee; in most other English-speaking countries (such as Canada, the UK and Australia) it is pronounced zed.  Generally, the absent zee-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a zee pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the zed pronunciation.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between N and zed:\n\nAlternate Zed Version:\n{ \\time 4/4 c'4 c' g' g' | a' a' g'2 | f'4 f' e' e' | d' d' c'2 | g'4 g' f' f' | e' e' d'2 | g'4 \\times 2/3 { f'8 f' f' } e'4 d' | c' r r2 | \\bar \"|.\" } \\addlyrics { A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V dub- a- U X Y \"Z(ed)\" }\na-b-c-d-e-f-g\nh-i-j-k-l-m-n\no-p-q-r-s-t-u\nv-w-x-y-z(ed)\n\nAnother alternate Zed version:\n\na-b-c, d-e-f\ng-h-i, j-k-l\nm-n-o-p-q-r-s\nt-u-v-w-x-y-z(ed)\n\nDutch version \n\na-b-c-d-e-f-g\nh-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p\nq-r-s-t-u-v-w\nx-y-z doen ook nog mee\nNote that the third line is lengthened and the fourth line is shortened, to compensate for the Dutch pronunciations.\n\nFrench Canadian version \n\nA French-language version of the song is also taught in Canada, with generally no alterations to the melody except in the final line that requires adjustment to accommodate the two-syllable pronunciation of the French y.\n\nPhonics songs \n\nBecause the English language has 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds (phonemes) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.\n\nAcrostic songs \n\nThere are also songs that go through the alphabet, making some of the letters stand for something in the process. An example, A, You're Adorable (also known as \"The Alphabet Love Song\"), was recorded in 1948, by Buddy Kaye, Fred Wise, Sidney Lippman, and later Perry Como.\n\nA newer example of this is from the musical Matilda. \"School Song\" is an acrostic that spells out the alphabet phonetically.\n\nBackwards song (Verse 2) \n\nThe group Wee Sing released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order, called \"ZYXs\".\n\nThe Canadian children's TV series The Big Comfy Couch used a version of the song in the first episode of Season 4, \"Backwards\".\n\nComedian Soupy Sales released a song in 1966 called \"Backwards Alphabet\" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style. The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with the Smothers Brothers in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of Alice Through the Looking Glass.",
