  "textBody" : "In computing, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like Console applications (also called Command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically.\nSuch programs are known as CGI scripts or simply as CGIs. The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server.  In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875 RFC3875: The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1]  In brief, the CGI program receives HTTP forms data via Unix/Linux standard input, and most other data (such as URL paths, URL arguments, and HTTP header data) via well-known Unix/Linux process environment variables.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) team wrote the specification for calling command line executables on the www-talk mailing list.[http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0485.html Server Scripts, by Rob McCool, www-talk mailing list, Sun, 14 Nov 1993 19:24:47 -0600][http://www.w3.org/CGI/ CGI: Common Gateway Interface] at w3.org The other Web server developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for Web servers ever since. A work group chaired by Ken Coar started in November 1997 to get the NCSA definition of CGI more formally defined. This work resulted in RFC 3875, which specified CGI Version 1.1. Specifically mentioned in the RFC are the following contributors:[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875 RFC3875: The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1]\n* Rob McCool (author of the NCSA HTTPd Web Server)\n* John Franks (author of the GN Web Server)\n* Ari Luotonen (the developer of the CERN httpd Web Server)\n* Tony Sanders (author of the Plexus Web Server)\n* George Phillips (Web server maintainer at the University of British Columbia)\n\nHistorically CGI scripts were often written using the C language. RFC 3875 \"The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\" partially defines CGI using C,[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875 RFC3875: The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1] as in saying that environment variables \"are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ\".\n\nPurpose of the CGI standard \n\nEach web server runs HTTP server software, which responds to requests from web browsers. Generally, the HTTP server has a directory (folder), which is designated as a document collection — files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server.[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2] For example, if the Web server has the domain name example.com, and its document collection is stored at /usr/local/apache/htdocs in the local file system, then the Web server will respond to a request for http://example.com/index.html by sending to the browser the (pre-written) file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html.\n\nFor pages constructed on the fly, the server software may defer requests to separate programs and relay the results to the requesting client (usually, a web browser that displays the page to the end user).  In the early days of the web, such programs were usually small and written in a scripting language; hence, they were known as scripts.\n\nSuch programs usually require some additional information to be specified with the request. For instance, if Wikipedia were implemented as a script, one thing the script would need to know is whether the user is logged in and, if logged in, under which name.  The content at the top of a Wikipedia page depends on this information.\n\nHTTP provides ways for browsers to pass such information to the web server, e.g. as part of the URL. The server software must then pass this information through to the script somehow.\n\nConversely, upon returning, the script must provide all the information required by HTTP for a response to the request: the HTTP status of the request, the document content (if available), the document type (e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text), etcetera.\n\nInitially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same.  Therefore, it was decided to establish a standard way for exchanging this information: CGI (the Common Gateway Interface, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts).\nWebpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as CGI scripts.\n\nThis standard was quickly adopted and is still supported by all well-known server software, such as Apache, IIS, and (with an extension) node.js-based servers.\n\nAn early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an \"action\" attribute and a button designated as the \"submit\" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the \"action\" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the \"action\" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces a HTML page.\n\nUsing CGI scripts \n\nA web server allows its owner to configure which URLs shall be handled by which CGI scripts.\n\nThis is usually done by marking a directory within the document collection as containing CGI scripts — its name is often cgi-bin. For example, /usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin could be designated as a CGI directory on the web server. When a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory (e.g., http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/with/additional/path?anda&query\nstring), then, instead of simply sending that file (/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl) to the Web browser, the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser. That is, anything that the script sends to standard output is passed to the Web client instead of being shown on-screen in a terminal window.\n\nAs remarked above, the CGI standard defines how additional information passed with the request is passed to the script.\nFor instance, if a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately after the name of the script (in this example, /with/additional/path), then that path is stored in the PATH_INFO environment variable before the script is called.\nIf parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP GET request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by paramvalue pairs; in the example, ?and\na&query=string), then those parameters are stored in the QUERY_STRING environment variable before the script is called.\nIf parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP POST request, they are passed to the script's standard input.\nThe script can then read these environment variables or data from standard input and adapt to the Web browser's request.Nelson, Anne Fulcher, and Nelson, William Harris Morehead.

The query string may be composed of *name\nvalue pairs separated with ampersands (such as var1val1&var2\nval2...) when used to submit form data transferred via GET method as defined by HTML application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n** REMOTE_HOST: host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup.\n** REMOTE_ADDR: IP address of the client (dot-decimal).\n** AUTH_TYPE: identification type, if applicable.\n** REMOTE_USER used for certain AUTH_TYPEs.\n** REMOTE_IDENT: see ident, only if server performed such lookup.\n** CONTENT_TYPE: Internet media type of input data if PUT or POST method are used, as provided via HTTP header.\n** CONTENT_LENGTH: similarly, size of input data (decimal, in octets) if provided via HTTP header.\n**Variables passed by user agent (HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, HTTP_USER_AGENT, HTTP_COOKIE and possibly others) contain values of corresponding HTTP headers and therefore have the same sense.\n\nThe program returns the result to the Web server in the form of standard output, beginning with a header and a blank line.\n\nThe header is encoded in the same way as an HTTP header and must include the MIME type of the document returned.[http://www.citycat.ru/doc/CGI/overview/primer.html CGI Primer (Mirror at citycat.ru)] The headers, supplemented by the Web server, are generally forwarded with the response back to the user.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program written in Python 2 along with the HTML that handles a simple addition problem.\n\n \n  \n   Enter two numbers to add:\n   First Number: \n   Second Number: \n   \n  \n \n\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport cgi\nimport cgitb\ncgitb.enable()\n\ninput_data = cgi.FieldStorage()\n\nprint 'Content-Type:text/html' # HTML is following\nprint                          # Leave a blank line\nprint 'Addition Results'\ntry:\n  num1 = int(input_data[\"num1\"].value)\n  num2 = int(input_data[\"num2\"].value)\nexcept:\n  print 'Sorry, we cannot turn your inputs into numbers (integers).'\n  return 1\nprint '{0} + {1} = {2}'.format(num1, num2, num1 + num2)\nThis Python 2 CGI gets the inputs from the HTML and adds the two numbers together.\n\nDeployment \n\nA Web server that supports CGI can be configured to interpret a URL that it serves as a reference to a CGI script. A common convention is to have a cgi-bin/ directory at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within this directory (and no other, for security) as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use filename extensions; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension .cgi, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts. While convenient, and required by many prepackaged scripts, it opens the server to attack if a remote user can upload executable code with the proper extension.\n\nIn the case of HTTP PUT or POSTs, the user-submitted data are provided to the program via the standard input. The Web server creates a subset of the environment variables passed to it and adds details pertinent to the HTTP environment.\n\nUses \n\nCGI is often used to process inputs information from the user and produce the appropriate output. An example of a CGI program is one implementing a Wiki. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into HTML, and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the \"Edit this page\" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML textarea or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.\n\nAlternatives \n\nCalling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.\nIf the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.\n\nThe overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as FastCGI that \"prefork\" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as mod_perl or mod_php. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as C or C++, rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as Perl or PHP, or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.\n\nAlternative approaches include:\n\n* Extensions such as Apache modules, NSAPI plugins, and ISAPI plugins allow third-party software to run on the web server.\n* FastCGI reduces overhead by allowing a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.\n* Simple Common Gateway Interface or SCGI is designed to be easier to implement, yet it reduces latency in some operations compared to CGI. \n* Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by Java EE, which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying threads, and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with Java Platform, Standard Edition on which the version of Java EE in use is based.\n\nThe optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.",

The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into HTML, and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the \"Edit this page\" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML textarea or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.\n\nAlternatives \n\nCalling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.\nIf the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.\n\nThe overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as FastCGI that \"prefork\" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as mod_perl or mod_php. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as C or C++, rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as Perl or PHP, or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.\n\nAlternative approaches include:\n\n* Extensions such as Apache modules, NSAPI plugins, and ISAPI plugins allow third-party software to run on the web server.\n* FastCGI reduces overhead by allowing a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.\n* Simple Common Gateway Interface or SCGI is designed to be easier to implement, yet it reduces latency in some operations compared to CGI. \n* Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by Java EE, which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying threads, and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with Java Platform, Standard Edition on which the version of Java EE in use is based.\n\nThe optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.
