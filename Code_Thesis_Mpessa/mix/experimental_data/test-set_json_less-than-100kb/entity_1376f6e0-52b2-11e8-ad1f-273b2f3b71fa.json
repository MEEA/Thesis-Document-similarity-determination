  "textBody" : "Ham is pork from a leg cut that has been preserved by wet or dry curing, with or without smoking.\"Bacon: Bacon and Ham Curing\" in Chambers's Encyclopædia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 2, p. 39. As a processed meat, the term \"ham\" includes both whole cuts of meat and ones that have been mechanically formed. \n\nHam is made around the world, including a number of highly coveted regional specialties, such as Westphalian ham and some varieties of Spanish jamón. In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection, such as Prosciutto di Parma and Prosciutto Toscano in Europe, and Smithfield ham in the US.\n\nHistory \n\nThe preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with Cato the Elder writing about the \"salting of hams\" in his De Agri Cultura tome around 160 BC.\n\nThere are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of cured ham. Larousse Gastronomique claims an origin from Gaul. It was certainly well established by the Roman period, as evidenced by an import trade from Gaul mentioned by Marcus Terentius Varro in his writings.\n\nThe modern word \"ham\" is derived from the Old English ham or hom meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant \"crooked\". It began to refer to the cut of pork derived from the hind leg of a pig around the 15th century.\n\nBecause of the preservation process, ham is a compound foodstuff or ingredient, being made up of the original meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s), such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own right.\n\nMethods \n\nHam is produced by curing raw pork by salting, also known as dry curing, or brining, also known as wet curing. Additionally smoking may be employed. Besides salt, several ingredients may be used to obtain flavoring and preservation, from black pepper (e.g. Prosciutto Toscano) to saffron (e.g. the \"Zafferano di San Gimignano\").\n\nDry-cured \n\nTraditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, such as with San Daniele or Parma hams, although this is comparatively rare. This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt while it is gradually pressed draining all the blood. Specific herbs and spices may be used to add flavour during this step. The hams are then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry. It is then hung to air for another period of time.\n\nThe duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham, with, for example, Serrano ham curing in 9–12 months, Parma hams taking more than 12 months, and Iberian ham taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics. Some dry cured hams, such as the Jinhua ham, take approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.\n\nMost modern dry cure hams also use nitrites (either sodium nitrite or potassium nitrate), which are added along with the salt. Nitrates are used because they prevent bacterial growth and, in a reaction with the meat's myoglobin, give the product a desirable dark red color. The amount and mixture of salt and nitrites used have an effect on the shrinkage of the meat. Because of the toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose of nitrite for humans is about 22 mg per kg body weight), some areas specify a maximum allowable content of nitrite in the final product. Under certain conditions, especially during cooking, nitrites in meat can react with degradation products of amino acids, forming nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens.\n\nThe dry curing of ham involves a number of enzymatic reactions. The enzymes involved are proteinases  (cathepsins – B, D, H & L, and calpains) and exopeptidases (peptidase and aminopeptidase). These enzymes cause proteolysis of muscle tissue, which creates large numbers of small peptides and free amino acids, while the adipose tissue undergoes lipolysis to create free fatty acids. Salt and phosphates act as strong inhibitors of proteolytic activity. Animal factors influencing enzymatic activity include age, weight, and breed. During the process itself, conditions such as temperature, duration, water content, redox potential, and salt content all have an effect.\n\nThe salt content in dry-cured ham varies throughout a piece of meat, with gradients determinable through sampling and testing or non-invasively through CT scanning.\n\nWet-cured \n\nWet-cured hams are brined, which involves the immersion of the meat in a brine, sometimes with other ingredients such as sugar also added for flavour. Meat is typically kept in the brine for around 3 to 14 days. Wet curing also has the effect of increasing volume and weight of the finished product, by about 4%.\n\nThe wet curing process can also be achieved by pumping the curing solution into the meat. This can be quicker, increase the weight of the finished product by more than immersion, and ensure a more even distribution of salt through the meat. This process is quicker than traditional brining, normally being completed in a few days.\n\nSmoking \n\nHam can also be additional preserved through by smoking (cooking), in which the meat is placed in a smokehouse (or equivalent) to be cured by the action of smoke.\n\nThe main flavor compounds of smoked ham are guaiacol, and its 4-, 5-, and 6-methyl derivatives as well as 2,6-dimethylphenol. These compounds are produced by combustion of lignin, a major constituent of wood used in the smokehouse.Wittkowski, Reiner; Ruther, Joachim; Drinda, Heike; Rafiei-Taghanaki, Foroozan \"Formation of smoke flavor compounds by thermal lignin degradation\" ACS Symposium Series (Flavor Precursors), 1992, volume 490, pp 232–243. \n\nLabeling \n\nIn many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition. For instance, in the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) says that \"the word 'ham', without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine\".\n\nIn addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a \"smoked\" ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a smokehouse or an atomized spray of liquid smoke such that the product appearance is equivalent; a \"hickory-smoked\" ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting \"smoke flavor\" is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was \"smoked\"; these are labeled \"smoke flavor added\". Hams can only be labeled \"honey-cured\" if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called \"lean\" and \"extra lean\" hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and cholesterol per 100 grams of product.\n\nWhole fresh pork leg can be labeled as fresh ham in the United States.\n\nProtected designations \n\nA number of hams worldwide have some level of protection of their unique characteristics, usually relating to their method of preservation or location of production or processing. Dependent on jurisdiction, rules may prevent any other product being sold with the particular appellation, such as through the European protected geographical indication.\n\n;Belgium\n*Jambon d'Ardenne – Wallonia\n\n;Bulgaria\n*Elenski but – Elena\n\n;China\n*Anfu ham- Jiangxi\n*Jinhua ham – Jinhua\n*Rugao ham – Rugao\n*Xuanwei ham – Xuanwei\n\n;Czechoslovakia\n*Pražká Šunka (\"Prague Ham\") – Prague\n\n;Croatia\n*Pršut\n\n;France\n*Bayonne ham (Jambon de Bayonne) – Bayonne\n*Jambon de Paris – Paris\n\n;Germany\n*Ammerländer Schinken – Ammerland\n*Schwarzwälder Schinken – Black Forest\n*Westfälischer Schinken – Westphalia\n\n;Italy\n*Prosciutto Toscano – Tuscany\n*Prosciutto di Parma – Parma\n*San Daniele\n*Speck Alto Adige – South Tyrol\n*Vallée d’Aoste Jambon de Bosses – Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses, Aosta Valley\n\n;Luxembourg\n*Éisleker ham – Oesling region\n\n;Montenegro\n*Njeguška pršuta – Njeguši, Montenegro\n\n;Portugal\n*fiambre\n*presunto\n\n;Slovenia\n*Kraški pršut\n\n;Spain\n* jamón serrano (Serrano ham),[http://www.jamondeteruel.com/ Regulator Agency of the Serrano Ham D.O.], Jamón de Teruel.com\n* jamón ibérico, made from the ibérico pig breed\n* Lacón Gallego, from Galicia\n* Jamón from Los Pedroches (Córdoba province)\n* Jamón from Huelva (including Jabugo), from Huelva province, Andalusia\n* Jamón from Guijuelo (Salamanca province)\n* Jamón from Dehesa de Extremadura, from Extremadura\n\n;United Kingdom\n*Wiltshire cure ham[https://books.google.com/books?id\n2pdEZc-74vkC&printsecfrontcover#v\nonepage&q&f=false A colour atlas of food quality control], section \"Brine curing\", pages 65 and 66.
