  "textBody" : "Ajmer is one of the major cities in the Indian state of Rajasthan and is the centre of the eponymous Ajmer District. According to the 2011 census, Ajmer had a population of 542,321 in the city, 551,101 including its suburbs. The city is located at a distance of 135 km from the state capital Jaipur and 205 Km from Jodhpur ( high Court) and 391 km from the national capital New Delhi.\n\nThe city was established as \"Ajayameru\" by a Shakambhari Chahamana (Chauhan) ruler, either Ajayaraja I or Ajayaraja II, and served as the Chahamana capital until the 12th century CE.\n\nAjmer is surrounded by the Aravalli Mountains. It is a pilgrimage centre for the shrine of the Sufi Saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and is also the base for visiting Pushkar (11 km), an ancient Hindu pilgrimage city, famous for the temple of Lord Brahma. Ajmer has been selected as one of the heritage cities for the HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme of Government of India.\n\nHistory \n\nAjmer was originally known as Ajayameru. The 12th century text Prithviraja Vijaya states that the Shakambhari Chahamana (Chauhan) king Ajayaraja II (ruled 1135 CE) established the city of Ajayameru. Historian Dasharatha Sharma notes that the earliest mention of the city's name occurs in Palha's Pattavali, which was copied in 1113 CE (1170 VS) at Dhara. This suggests that Ajmer was founded sometime before 1113 CE. A prashasti (eulogistic inscription), issued by Vigraharaja IV and found at Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra, states Ajayadeva (that is, Ajayaraja II) moved his residence to Ajmer.\n\nThe later text Prabandha-Kosha states that it was the 8th century king Ajayaraja I who commissioned the Ajayameru fort, which later came to be known as the Taragarh fort of Ajmer. According to historian R. B. Singh, this claim appears to be true, as inscriptions dated to the 8th century CE have been found at Ajmer. Singh theorizes that Ajayaraja II later enlarged the town, constructed palaces, and moved the Chahamana capital from Shakambhari to Ajmer.\n\nGeography\n\nAjmer is in the northwest section of India and is surrounded by the Aravalli Mountains. It is situated on the lower slopes of the Taragarh Hill of that range. The massive rocks of Nagpaharh range protects Ajmer from the Thar Desert to the west.\n\nAjmer is antipodal to the Chilean island Isla Salas y Gómez.\n\nClimate\n\nAjmer has a hot, semi-arid climate with over 55 cm of rain every year, but most of the rain occurs in the monsoon months, between June and September. Temperatures remain relatively high throughout the year, with the summer months of April to early July having an average daily temperature of about 30 °C. During the monsoon there is frequent heavy rain and thunderstorms, but flooding is not a common occurrence. The winter months of November to February are mild and temperate with average temperatures ranging from 15 – with little or no humidity. There are, however, occasional cold weather fronts that cause temperatures to fall to near freezing levels.\n\nTransportation \n\nAjmer is well connected to the major cities of India by land and rail.\n\nAir\n\nWork on the Kishangarh Airport near Ajmer was inaugurated by Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in September 2013 and it is expected to commence operations in 2017. As of 2017, domestic flights to Delhi and Jaipur are available. In the next two to three years it will become an international airport.\n\nRail\n\nAjmer is well connected to major cities by rail. The Ajmer Junction (अजमेर जंक्शन)  at Topadara, Jaipur Road serves Ajmer to all cities of India by rail. It occurs at broad gauge, Northwestern line.\n\nTourist sites \n\n*The Ajmer Sharif Dargah: It is a shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti which is situated at the foot of the Taragarh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the Akbari Mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and containing the domed tomb of the saint. Akbar and his queen used to come here by foot every year on pilgrimage from Agra in observance of a vow when he prayed for a son. The large pillars called \"Kose ('Mile') Minars\", erected at intervals of about 2 mi along the entire way between Agra and Ajmer mark the places where the royal pilgrims halted every day.

The battlements run along the top of the hill. The walls are about 2 mi in circumference and the fort can only be approached by way of a very steep slope.

Apart from the mosque, called Jama Iltutmish (pronounced Altamash locally), nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are still unsurpassed as examples of Hindu architecture and sculpture.
