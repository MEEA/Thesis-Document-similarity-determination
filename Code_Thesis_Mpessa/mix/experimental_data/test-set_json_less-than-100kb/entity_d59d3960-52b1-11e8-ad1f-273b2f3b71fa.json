  "textBody" : "The Coral Sea Islands Territory is an external territory of Australia which comprises a group of small and mostly uninhabited tropical islands and reefs in the Coral Sea, northeast of Queensland, Australia. The only inhabited island is Willis Island. The territory covers 780000 km², most of which is ocean, extending east and south from the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef, and includes Heralds Beacon Island, Osprey Reef, the Willis Group, and fifteen other reef/island groups. Cato Island is the highest point in the Territory.Geoscience Australia. [http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/coral.htm Coral Sea Islands] \n\nHistory and status \n\nThe Coral Sea Islands were first charted in 1803. In the 1870s and 1880s the islands were mined for guano but the absence of a reliable supply of fresh water prevented long-term habitation. The Coral Sea Islands became an Australian external territory in 1969 by the Coral Sea Islands Act (prior to that, the area was considered part of Queensland) and extended in 1997 to include Elizabeth Reef and Middleton Reef nearly 800 km further south, already in the Tasman Sea.\n\nThe two latter reefs are much closer to Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, (about 150 km) than to the southernmost island of the rest of the territory, Cato Island. The islands, cays and reefs of the Great Barrier Reef are not part of the territory, belonging to Queensland instead. The outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef is the boundary between Queensland and the Coral Sea Islands Territory.\n\nThe territory is a possession or external territory of Australia, administered from Canberra by the Attorney-General's Department (before 29 November 2007 administration was carried out by the Department of Transport and Regional Services). Defence is the responsibility of Australia, and the territory is visited regularly by the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nAustralia maintains automatic weather stations on many of the isles and reefs, and claims a 200 nmi exclusive fishing zone. There is no economic activity (except for a significant but as yet unquantified charter fishing and diving industry), and only a staff of three or four people to run the meteorological station on Willis Island (South Islet), established in 1921. In November 2011, the Australian government announced that a 989842 km2 protected area was planned in the Coral Sea.\n\nAs applicable, the laws of the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) apply on the Coral Sea Islands. The territory's FIPS 10-4 code is CR, whereas ISO 3166 includes it in Australia (AU). \nGay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands\n\nIn 2004, gay activists declared the Coral Sea Islands Territory Independent from Australia.  \nThe independence of the kingdom is based on Australia being guilty of \"unjust enrichment\", because of the government’s plan to amend the marriage act so as to prevent homosexual couples who were married overseas to have their relationship recognised. The law of “Unjust Enrichment” states: “If something is unjustly taken compensation must be made.”\n\nThe gay activists believe that the change in the marriage law has taken from homosexual people the right to be treated equally, “whether it be marriage, superannuation, hospital visits, adoption or IVF treatments”. Instead of financial compensation, the activists have chosen “territorial compensation” by establishing an independent gay state on a scattering of tropical islands in the Coral Sea.\n\nThe initiative for the founding of a gay kingdom was taken during the Brisbane Gay and Lesbian Pride Festival. The Coral Sea Islands were chosen because of a provision of international law that states “Oppressed people of overseas territories have a right to self government and self determination”. For a long time these islands were administered as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, but from the 1960s they were administered from Australia by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories as an overseas external territory of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nThe activists also presume that neither the United Kingdom nor Australia has any rights to the Coral Sea Islands, because neither government has provided to the gay government any recording of anyone proclaiming the Coral Sea Islands as part of the British/Australian Crown.\n\nThe Gay and Lesbian Kingdom raised the gay rainbow pride flag on Cato Island on 14 June 2004 and declared the territory an independent gay and lesbian state. A memorial plaque on the north eastern tip of Cato Island commemorates this historic event and reads:\n\n\"On the 14th day of June 2004, at this highest point in the Coral Sea, Emperor Dale Parker Anderson raised the gay rainbow flag and claimed the islands of the Coral Sea in his name as homeland for the gay and lesbian peoples of the world. God Save our King!\" The Kingdom then declared war on Australia to force the Australian Government to recognise its independence.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, Liberal Senator Eric Abetz objected to the rainbow flag being displayed in the Department of Finance and other Australian Government buildings Matt Young (28 February 2017). http://www.news.com.au/national/conservative-liberal-senator-eric-abetz-has-an-issue-with-the-rainbow-flag-ocmparing-it-to-a-hostile-nation/news-story/b9f2cc53605482296f0ba41f80b1f4a8[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/abetz-rainbow-flag-hostile-nation/155996 \"Senator Eric Abetz criticises government department flying ‘hostile’ activist rainbow flag\"], Jess Jones, Star Observer, 28 February 2017. on the grounds that government departments should take a neutral stand on political debates such as same sex marriage.
