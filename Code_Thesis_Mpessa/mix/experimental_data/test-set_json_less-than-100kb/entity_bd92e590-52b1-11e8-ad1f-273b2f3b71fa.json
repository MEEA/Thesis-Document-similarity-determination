  "textBody" : "The Lumière brothers, Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas (19 October 1862, Besançon, France – 10 April 1954, Lyon) and Louis Jean (5 October 1864, Besançon, France – 7 June 1948, Bandol), were among the first filmmakers in history. They patented an improved cinematograph, which in contrast to Thomas Edison's \"peepshow\" kinetoscope allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lumière brothers were born in Besançon, France, to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911)[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/antoinelumiere http://www.victorian-cinema.net/antoinelumiere] and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to Lyon in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended La Martiniere, the largest technical school in Lyon. Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.\n\nWhen their father retired in 1892 the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably film perforations (originally implemented by Emile Reynaud) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original cinématographe had been patented by Léon Guillaume Bouly on 12 February 1892.[http://cinematographes.free.fr/bouly-219350.html \"Brevet FR 219.350\"]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 13 November 2013. The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.[http://cinematographes.free.fr/lumiere-245032.html \"Brevet FR 245.032\"]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 12 November 2013. The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on 19 March 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.\n\nThe Lumières brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumière Autochrome.\n\nLouis died on 6 June 1948 and Auguste on 10 April 1954. They are buried in a family tomb in the New Guillotiere Cemetery in Lyon.\n\nFirst film screenings\n\nThe Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895. This first screening on 22 March 1895 took place in Paris, at the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which Léon Gaumont, then director of the company the Comptoir géneral de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills photographs.Chardère 1985, p. 71. The American Woodville Latham had screened works of film month later on 20 May 1895.Burns, Paul.

The first public screening of films at which admission was charged was a program by the Skladanowsky brothers that was held on 1 November 1895, in Berlin.[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/skladanowsky Who's Who of Victorian Cinema]\n\nThe Lumières gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris.[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ 28 December 1895.] This history-making presentation featured 10 short films, including their first film, Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory).[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html \"La première séance publique payante\", Institut Lumière] \n\n \nEach film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.\n\n It is believed their first film was recorded that same year (1895) with Léon Bouly's cinématographe device, which was patented the previous year. The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded 19 March 1895, and then publicly projected 22 March at the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in Paris. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project motion pictures — was further developed by the Lumières.Chardère 1987, p. 70.\n\nThe public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following 10 short films (in order of presentation):[https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html \"Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4\"].

Their actuality films, or actualités, are often cited as the first, primitive documentaries. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of L'Arroseur Arrosé.\n\nEarly colour photography\n\nThe brothers stated that \"the cinema is an invention without any future\" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as Georges Méliès. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process,[http://www.ignomini.com/photographica/stereophotovintage/Trichrome/Lumiere_Trichrome.html \"Lumiere Trichrome\"]. ignomini.com. Retrieved 2 January 2017. a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the Autochrome Lumière, which was launched on the market in 1907.Lavédrine and Gandolfo 2013, p. 70. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with Ilford.[http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?executeshow_document&id\nMERIMEEIA69000030 \"City of Lyon Document\"]. sdx.rhonealpes.fr.

Louis Le Prince and Claude Mechant had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, Kazimierz Prószyński had built his camera and projecting device, called Pleograph, in 1894. Max and Emil Skladanowsky, inventors of the Bioscop, had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (1 November 1895, in Berlin). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.Cook 2004, p. 34.\n\nAlthough the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.",
