  "textBody" : "The demographics of Kazakhstan enumerate the demographic features of the population of Kazakhstan, including population growth, population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. Some use the word Kazakh to refer to the Kazakh ethnic group and language (autochthonous to Kazakhstan as well as parts of Russia, China and Mongolia) and Kazakhstani to refer to Kazakhstan and its citizens regardless of ethnicity,Schreiber, Dagmar and Tredinnick, Jeremy. Kazakhstan. Odyssey Publications, 2010, p. 82. but it is common to use Kazakh in both senses.[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/asia-oceania/kazakhstan?profile=all UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Kazakhstan, 2 Feb 2011].[http://www.erlanidrissov.com/ Ambassador Erlan A Idissov, Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the USA.]\n\nDemographic trends\n\nOfficial estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 18,137,300 as of December 2017, of which 44% is rural and 56% urban population., Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan  The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from January 1999 (slightly less than 15 million). These estimates have been confirmed by the 2009 population census, and this means that the decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and reversed.\n\nThe proportion of men makes up 48.3%, the proportion of women 51.7%. The proportion of Kazakhs makes up 63.6%, Russians 23.7%, Uzbeks 2.9%, Ukrainians 2.1%, Uygur 1.4%, Tatars 1.3%, Germans 1.1%, others 3.9%. Note that a large percentage of the population are of mixed ethnicity.\n\nThe population of Kazakhstan increased steadily from 6.1 million in the 1939 census to 16.5 million in the 1989 census. Official estimates indicate that the population continued to increase after 1989, peaking out at 17 million in 1993 and then declining to 15 million in the 1999 census. The downward trend continued through 2002, when the estimated population bottomed out at 14.9 million, and then resumed its growth.[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2003/0103/analit03.php Population dynamics and ethnic composition of Kazakhstan in the second half of the 20th century], Demoscope Weekly, No. 103-104, 3–16 March 2003   Significant amounts of Russians returned to Russia.  Kazakhstan underwent significant urbanization during the first 50 years of the Soviet era, as the share of rural population declined from more than 90% in the 1920s to less than 50% since the 1970s.\n\nPopulation of Kazakhstan 1897–2018\n\nData sources: Population 1897 from Russian Empire Census. Population 1926 from First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union. Population 1939-1999 from demoscope.ru, 2002-2008 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site.[http://www.stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx Population and social policy], Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan  Rural/urban shares 1939-1993 from statistical yearbooks, print editions,Statistical Yearbook of Kazakhstan, Almaty, various years since 1980  2002-2008 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site. 2009-2014 from Kazakhstan Statistical Agency web site.[http://www.stat.gov.kz] Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan \n\nAs of 2003, there were discrepancies between Western sources regarding the population of Kazakhstan. United States government sources, including the CIA World Fact Book and the US Census Bureau International Data Base, listed the population as 15,340,533,[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html CIA Factbook (Kazakhstan)] Retrieved on May 2, 2008 while the World Bank gave a 2002 estimate of 14,858,948. This discrepancy was presumably due to difficulties in measurement caused by the large migratory population in Kazakhstan, emigration, and low population density - only about 5.5 persons per km² in an area the size of Western Europe.\n\nVital statistics\n\nBirths and deaths\n\nhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001 United nations. Demographic Yearbooks\n\n1 \n\nStructure of the population  \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2008) (Estimates) :\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\nTotal fertility rate by regions of Kazakhstan: Mangystau - 3.80, South Kazakhstan - 3.71, Kyzylorda - 3.42, Atyrau - 3.29, Jambyl - 3.20, Aqtobe - 2.70, Almaty (province) - 2.65, Almaty (city) - 2.65, City of Astana - 2.44, West Kazakhstan - 2.29, Aqmola - 2.19, East Kazakhstan - 2.07, Qaragandy - 2.04, Pavlodar - 1.98, North Kazakhstan - 1.72, Qostanay - 1.70, Republic of Kazakhstan - 2.65. Thus it can be seen that fertility rate is higher in more traditionalist and religious south and west, and lower in the north and east, where the percentage of Slavic and German population is still relatively high.[http://www.stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx]\n\nAccording to the Kazakhstan Demographic and Health Survey in 1999, the TFR for Kazakhs was 2.5 and that for Russians was 1.38. TFR in 1989 for Kazakhs & Russians were 3.58 and 2.24 respectively.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nHistory of ethnic composition \n\nKazakhstan's dominant ethnic group Kazakhs, traces its origin to 15th century, when a number of Turkic and some Mongol tribes united to establish the Kazakh Khanate. With cohesive culture and national identity, they constituted absolute majority on the land until Russian colonization.\nRussian advancement into the territory of Kazakhstan began in the late 18th century, when the Kazakhs nominally accepted Russian rule in exchange for protection against repeated attacks by the western Mongolian Kalmyks. In the 1890s, Russian peasants began to settle the fertile lands of northern Kazakhstan, causing many Kazakhs to move eastwards into Chinese territory in search of new grazing grounds. The 1906 completion of the Trans-Aral Railway between Orenburg and Tashkent further facilitated Russian colonization.Olcott, M. B. (1995). The Kazakhs. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.Pierce, A. R. (1960) Russian Central Asia, 1867-1917: A study in colonial rule. Berkeley: University of California Press. The first collectivized farms opened in Kazakhstan in 1921, populated primarily by Russians and Soviet deportees. In 1930, as part of the first Five Year Plan, the Kazakh Central Committee decreed the sedentarization of nomads and their incorporation into collectivized farms. This movement resulted in devastating famine, claiming the lives of an estimated 40% of ethnic Kazakhs (1.5 million), between 1930-33.Pianciola, N. (2001). The collectivization famine in Kazakhstan, 1931–1933. Harvard Ukrainian Studies, 25(3/4), 237–251. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/41036834 Hundreds of thousands also fled to China, Iran and Afghanistan. The famine rendered Kazakhs a minority within Kazakhstan, and only after the republic gained independence in 1991 did Kazakhs recover a slim demographic majority within Kazakhstan.\n\nDemographics would continue to shift in the 1950-1960s, wherein as part of Nikita Khrushchev's Virgin Lands Campaign, hundreds of thousands of Soviet deportees were relocated to the Kazakh steppes in order to farm. As recognized in the 1959 census, the Kazaks became a minority for the first time in history, comprising just  30% of the total population of Kazakhstan. Russians numbered 42.7%.Zardykhan, Z. (2004). Russians in Kazakhstan and demographic change: Imperial legacy and the Kazakh way of nation building. Asian Ethnicity, 5(1), 61–79.\n\nAccording to the 2009 census, the ethnic composition of Kazakhstan is approximately: 63.1% Kazakh, 23.7% Russian, 2.9% Uzbek, 2.1% Ukrainian, 1.4% Uyghur, 1.3% Tatar, 1.1% German, 1% Kyrgyz, and Central Intelligence Agency.
