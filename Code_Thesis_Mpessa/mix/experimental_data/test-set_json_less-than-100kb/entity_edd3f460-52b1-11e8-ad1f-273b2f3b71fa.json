  "textBody" : "Erotica is any artistic work that deals substantively with erotically stimulating or sexually arousing subject matter. Erotic art may use any artistic form to depict erotic content, including painting, sculpture, drama, film or music. Erotic literature and erotic photography have become genres in their own right.

A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica \"seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes\" that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography.[http://tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html \"Erotica Is Not Pornography\"].
