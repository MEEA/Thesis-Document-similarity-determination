  "textBody" : "Glasnevin (, also known as Glas Naedhe, meaning \"stream of O'Naeidhe\" after an ancient chieftain) is a largely residential neighbourhood of Dublin, Ireland.  Dublin City University has its main campus and other facilities in the area.\n\nGlasnevin is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.[http://www.logainm.ie/846.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Glasnevin civil parish\n\nGeography\n\nA mainly residential neighbourhood, Glasnevin is located on the Northside of the city of Dublin (about 3 km north of Dublin City centre). It was established on the northern bank of the River Tolka, and now extends north and south of it.  At least two streams flow into the Tolka in the area, and can be seen near the Catholic church; one comes from the vicinity of Glasnevin Cemetery and one from the north.  In addition, a major diversion from the Wad River comes from the Ballymun area.\n\nGlasnevin is bordered to the north by Finglas, northeast by Ballymun and Santry, Whitehall to the east, Phibsboro and Drumcondra to the south and Cabra to the west.\n\nGlasnevin is part of the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Central and Dublin North-West\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\n\nGlasnevin seems to have been founded by Saint Mobhi (sometimes known as St Berchan) in the sixth (or perhaps fifth) century as a monastery. His monastery continued to be used for many years afterwards - St. Colman is recorded as having paid homage to its founder when he returned from abroad to visit Ireland a century after St Mobhi's death in 544. St. Columba of Iona is thought to have studied under St. Mobhi, but left Glasnevin following an outbreak of plague and journeyed north to open the House at Derry; there is a long street (Iona Road) in Glasnevin named in his honour and the church on Iona Road is called Saint Columba's.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nA settlement grew up around the monastery, which survived until the Viking invasions in the eighth century. After raids on monasteries at Glendalough and Clondalkin, the monasteries at Glasnevin and Finglas were attacked and destroyed.\n\nBy 822 Glasnevin, along with Grangegorman and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as Deansgrange),Mac Giolla Phadraig, Brian, '14th century life in a Dublin Monastery' in Dublin Historical Record 1(3) (September, 1938), pp 69, 72. had become parts of the grange (farm) of Christ Church Cathedral and it seems to have maintained this connection up to the time of the Reformation.\n\nThe Battle of Clontarf was fought on the banks of the River Tolka in 1014 (a  field called the bloody acre is supposed to be part of the site). The Irish defeated the Danes in a battle, in which 7,000 Danes and 4,000 Irish died.\n\nThe 12th century saw the Normans (who had conquered England and Wales in the eleventh century) invade Ireland. As local rulers continued fighting amongst themselves the Norman King of England Henry II was invited to intervene. He arrived in 1171, took control of much land, and then parcelled it out amongst his supporters. Glasnevin ended up under the jurisdiction of Finglas Abbey. Later, Laurence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin, took responsibility for Glasnevin and it became the property of the Priory of the Most Holy Trinity (Christ Church Cathedral).\n\nIn 1240 a church and tower was reconstructed on the site of the Church of St. Mobhi in the monastery. The returns of the church for 1326 stated that 28 tenants resided in Glasnevin. The church was enlarged in 1346, along with a small hall known as the Manor Hall.\n\nLate Middle Ages\n\nWhen King Henry VIII broke from Rome an era of religious repression began. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Catholic Church property and land was appropriated to the new Church of England, and monasteries (including the one at Glasnevin) were forcibly closed and fell into ruin. Glasnevin had at this stage developed as a village, with its principal landmark and focal point being its \"bull-ring\" noted in 1542.\n\nBy 1667 Glasnevin had expanded - but not by very much; it is recorded as containing 24 houses. The development of the village was given a fresh impetus when Sir John Rogerson built his country residence - \"The Glen\" or \"Glasnevin House\" - outside the village.\n\nThe plantations of Ireland saw the settlement of Protestant English families on land previously held by Catholics. Lands at Glasnevin were leased to such families and a Protestant church was erected there in 1707. It was built on the site of the old Catholic Church and was named after St. Mobhi. The church was largely rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The attached churchyard became a graveyard for both Protestants and Catholics.  It is said that Robert Emmet is buried there, this claim being made because once somebody working in the graveyard there dug up a headless body.\n\nEarly modern times\n\nBy now Glasnevin was an area for families of distinction - in spite of a comment attributed to the Protestant Archbishop King of Dublin that \"when any couple had a mind to be wicked, they would retire to Glasnevin\". In a letter, dated 1725 he described Glasnevin as \"the receptacle for thieves and rogues. The first search when anything was stolen, was there, and when any couple had a mind to retire to be wicked there was their harbour. But since the church was built, and service regularly settled, all these evils are banished. Good houses are built in it, and the place civilised.\"Richard Mant, History of the Church of Ireland. Glasnevin National School was also built during this period.\n\n19th and 20th centuries\n\nIn the 1830's, the civil parish population was recorded as 1,001, of whom 559 resided in the village. Glasnevin was described as a parish in the barony of Coolock, pleasantly situated and the residence of many families of distinction.Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, Lewis (1837)\n\nOn 1 June 1832, Charles Lindsay, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin and the William John released their holdings of Sir John Rogerson's lands at Glasnevin, (including Glasnevin House) to George Hayward Lindsay. This transfer included the sum of 1,500 Pounds Sterling. Although this does not specifically cite the marriage of George Hayward Lindsay to Lady Mary Catherine Gore, George Lindsay almost certainly came into the lands at Glasnevin as a result of his marriage.\n\nWhen Drumcondra began to rapidly expand in the 1870s, the residents of Glasnevin sought to protect their district and opposed being merged with the neighbouring suburb. One of the objectors was the property-owner, Dr Gogarty, the father of the Irish poet, Oliver St. John Gogarty.\n\nGlasnevin became a township in 1878 and became part of the City of Dublin in 1900 under the Dublin Boundaries Act, which received the Royal Assent on August 6, 1900.\n\nGeorge Hayward Lindsay's eldest son, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gore Lindsay, was in possession of his father's lands at Glasnevin when the area began to be developed at the beginning of the twentieth-century. The development of his lands after 1903/04 marked the start of the gradual development of the area.\n\nGlasnevin remained relatively undeveloped until the opening up of the Carroll Estate in 1914, which saw the creation of the redbrick residential roads running down towards Drumcondra. The process was accelerated by Dublin Corporation in the 1920s and the present shape of the suburb was firmly in place by 1930. Nevertheless, until comparatively recent years, a short stroll up the Old Finglas Road brought you rapidly into open countryside.\n\nThe start of the 20th century also saw the opening of a short lived railway station on the Drumcondra and North Dublin Link Railway line from Glasnevin Junction to Connolly Station (then Amiens Street). It opened in 1906 and closed at the end of 1907. Glasnevin railway station opened on 1 April 1901 and closed on 1 December 1910.\n\nVillage of Glasnevin\n\nThe village has changed a lot over the years, and is now part of Dublin city. It is now populated by a mix of young families, senior citizens and students attending Dublin City University.\n\nAs well as the amenities of the National Botanic Gardens (Ireland) and local parks, the national meteorological office Met Éireann, the [http://www.cfb.ie/Central Fisheries Board], the National Standards Authority of Ireland, [http://www.sei.ie/ Sustainable Energy Ireland], the [http://www.nml-ireland.ie/ National Metrology Laboratory] (NML), the Department of Defence and the national enterprise and trade board Enterprise Ireland are all located in the area.\n\nNational Botanic Gardens\n\nThe house and lands of the poet Thomas Tickell were sold in 1790 to the Irish Parliament and given to the Royal Dublin Society for them to establish Ireland's first Botanic Gardens. The gardens were the first location in Ireland where the infection responsible for the 1845–1847 potato famine was identified. Throughout the famine research to stop the infection was undertaken at the gardens.\n\nThe 48 acre which border the River Tolka also adjoin the Prospect Cemetery. In 2002 the Botanic Gardens gained a new two-storey complex which included a new cafe and a large lecture theatre. The Irish National Herbarium is also located at the botanic gardens.\n\nGlasnevin (Prospect) Cemetery\n\nProspect Cemetery is located in Glasnevin, although better known as Glasnevin Cemetery, the most historically notable burial place in the country and the last resting place, among a host of historical figures, of Michael Collins, Eamon DeValera, Charles Stewart Parnell and also Arthur Griffith.  This graveyard led to Glasnevin being known as \"the dead centre of Dublin\". It opened in 1832 and is the final resting place for thousands of ordinary citizens, as well as many Irish patriots.\n\nHart's Corner\n\nApproaching Glasnevin via Phibsboro is what is known as Hart's Corner but which about 200 years ago was called Glasmanogue, and was then a well-known stage on the way to Finglas. At an earlier date the name possessed a wider signification and was applied to a considerable portion of the adjoining district.\n\nDelville\n\nAt the start of the 18th century a large house, called Delville - known at first as The Glen - was built on the site of the present Bon Secours Hospital, Dublin. Its name was an amalgamation of the surnames of two tenants, Dr. Helsam and Dr. Patrick Delany (as Heldeville), both Fellows of Trinity College.\n\nWhen Delany married his first wife he acquired sole ownership, but it became famous as the home of Delany and his second wife - Mary Pendarves. She was a widow whom Delany married in 1743, and was an accomplished letter writer.\n\nThey couple were friends of Dean Jonathan Swift and, through him, of Alexander Pope. Pope encouraged the Delaneys to develop a garden in a style then becoming popular in England - moving away from the very formal, geometric layout that was common. He redesigned the house in the style of a villa and had the gardens laid out in the latest Dutch fashion creating what was almost certainly Ireland's first naturalistic garden.\n\nThe house was, under Mrs Delany, a centre of Dublin's intellectual life. Swift is said to have composed many of his campaigning pamphlets while staying there. He and his life - long companion Stella were both in the habit of visiting, and Swift satirised the grounds which he considered too small for the size of the house. Through her correspondence with her sister, Mrs Dewes, Mary wrote of Swift in 1733: \"he calls himself my master and corrects me when I speak bad English or do not pronounce my words distinctly\".\n\nPatrick Delany died in 1768 at the age of 82, prompting his widow to sell Delville and return to her native England until her death twenty years later.\n\nThe Pyramid Church\n\nGlasnevin is also a parish in the Fingal South West deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.[http://www.glasnevinparish.ie/ Official website] - Glasnevin parish It is served by the Church of Lady of Dolours. The church underwent some refurbishment work inside and in its grounds and car park during the first half of 2011. A timber church, which originally stood on Berkeley Road, was moved to a riverside site on Botanic Avenue early in the twentieth century. The altar in this church was from Newgate prison in Dublin. It served as the parish church until it was replaced, in 1972, by a structure resembling a pyramid when viewed from Botanic Avenue. The previous church was known locally as \"The Woodener\" or \"The Wooden\" and the new building is still known to older residents as \"The new Woodener\" or \"The Wigwam\".\n\nMet Éireann\n\nIn 1975 the new headquarters of Met Éireann, the Irish Meteorological Office, opened just off Glasnevin Hill, on the former site of Marlborough House. The Met Éireann building too was built in a somewhat pyramidal shape and is recognised as one of the most significant, smaller commercial buildings, to be erected in Dublin in the 1970s.\n\nGriffith Avenue\n\nGriffith Avenue, which runs through Glasnevin, Drumcondra and Marino. The avenue spans three electoral constituencies. It was named after Arthur Griffith who was the founder and third leader of Sinn Féin and also served as President of Dáil Éireann. Arthur Griffith also was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nAmenities and sport\n\nThe Gaelic games of Gaelic football, hurling, camogie and Gaelic handball are all organised locally by Na Fianna CLG, while soccer is played by local clubs Iona FC(now defunct), Tolka Rovers, Glasnevin FC and Glasnaion FC. They celebrated their 125th anniversary in 2006. Basketball is organised by Tolka Rovers. Tennis is played in Charleville Lawn Tennis Club, founded in 1894 by a small group of tennis enthusiasts headed by a Mrs McConnell. Charleville took its name from the original location at the corner of the Charleville and Cabra Roads. The move to its present location on Whitworth Road took place in 1904. The club boasts a membership of 400 senior and junior members and the club has won many Dublin Lawn Tennis Council titles, above the average for a club of their size. Hockey is also played in Botanic Hockey club on the Old Finglas Road. Glasnevin Boxing Club and Football(soccer) club has a clubhouse on Mobhi road.\n\nScouting has a strong tradition in Glasnevin with 1st Dublin (L.H.O) Scout Troop located on the corner of Griffith Avenue and Ballygall Road East. The Scout group celebrated 100 years of Scouting in 2011 making it one of the longest established Scout Groups in the world.\n\nThere are several primary schools in Glasnevin, including Lindsay Road National School, Glasnevin National School, Glasnevin Educate Together National school, North Dublin National School Project, Scoil Mobhi, St.Brigids GNS, St.Columbas NS and St.Vincents CBS.\n\nThere are several Roman Catholic secondary schools in the area  St Vincent's (Christian Brothers) School, Scoil Chaitríona and St Mary's Secondary School.\n\nBilly Whelan, one of the eight Manchester United players who lost their lives in the Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958, was born locally on 1 April 1935. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nNotable people\n\n*Margaret Buckley\n*Niamh Kavanagh, singer and winner of the  Eurovision Song Contest\n*Saint Canice\n*Liam Harrison, Musician and Songwriter\n*Robbie Kelleher\n*Colm Meaney\n*Damien McCaul - Television presenter and Dublin's Q102 disc jockey\n*John O'Connell\n*Francis Martin O'Donnell\n*Patrick Denis O'Donnell\n*Michael O'Hehir\n*James O'Higgins Norman\n*John J.
