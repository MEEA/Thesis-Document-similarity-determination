  "textBody" : "A Burns supper is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns, the author of many Scots poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally  known as Robert Burns Day (or Robbie Burns Day or Rabbie Burns Day) but more commonly known as Burns Night (). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first supper was held in memoriam at Burns Cottage by Burns's friends, on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death; it has been a regular occurrence ever since. The first still extant Burns Club was founded in Greenock in 1801 by merchants who were born in Ayrshire, some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803, they discovered the Ayr parish records that noted his date of birth was actually 25 January 1759. Since then, suppers have been held on or about 25 January.\n\nBurns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include haggis (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in Address to a Haggis), Scotch whisky and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the Freemasons or St Andrews Societies; they occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard order.\n\nStandard order \n\nPiping in guests\n\nA piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party. At less formal gatherings, traditional Scottish music is played.[http://www.visitscotland.com/en-us/about/robert-burns/supper-whats-involved \"Burns Supper – what's involved?\", VisitScotland.com, Buidheann Turasachd Nàiseanta na h-Alba]\n\nHost's welcoming speech \n\nThe host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns/burns_night_running_order.shtml \"Burns Night\", BBC]\n\nAll the guests are seated and grace is said, usually using the Selkirk Grace, a well-known thanksgiving said before meals that uses the Scots language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century as the \"Galloway Grace\" or the \"Covenanters' Grace\". It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the Earl of Selkirk.\n\nSelkirk Grace \n\nSome hae meat an canna eat,\nAnd some wad eat that want it;\nBut we hae meat, and we can eat,\nAnd sae the Lord be thankit.\n\nSoup course\n\nThe supper starts with the soup course.  Normally, a Scottish soup, such as Scotch broth, potato soup, cullen skink, or cock-a-leekie, is served.\n\nHaggis\n\n\"Piping\" of haggis \n\nEveryone stands as the haggis is brought in. It is usually brought in by the cook on a large dish, generally while a piper plays the bagpipe and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. \"A Man's A Man for A' That\", \"Robbie Burns Medley\" or \"The Star O' Robbie Burns\" might be played.Archie Cairns – Book 1 Pipe Music 1995 The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the \nAddress to a Haggis.\n\nAddress to a Haggis \n\nAt the line His knife see rustic Labour dicht, the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife. At the line An' cut you up wi' ready slicht, he plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly, the \"ceremony\" is a highlight of the evening.\n\nMain course \n\nAt the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, and the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed swede (neeps).\n\nOther courses\n\nA dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc., may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be cranachan or tipsy laird (whisky trifle), followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the \"water of life\" (uisge beatha), Scotch whisky.\n\nToasts\n\nWhen the meal reaches the coffee stage, various speeches and toasts are given.\n\nImmortal memory \n\nThe main speaker gives a speech remembering some aspect of Burns's life or poetry. It may be either light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or a song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.\n\nAddress to the Lassies \n\nThis was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, it is now much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing and not offensive, particularly since it will be followed by a reply from the \"lassies\" concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.\n\nReply to the Laddies \n\nThis is occasionally (and humorously) called the \"Toast to the Laddies\". Like the previous toast, it is generally now quite wide-ranging. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, it should be amusing but not offensive. Quite often, the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.\n\nWorks by Burns \n\nAfter the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns (such as Ae Fond Kiss, Parcel o' Rogues and A Man's a Man) and more poetry (such as To a Mouse, To a Louse, Tam o' Shanter, The Twa Dogs and Holy Willie's Prayer).\n\nThat may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish. It may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests may also be invited to sing or say works from their land.\n\nClosing \n\nFinally, the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks. Then, everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing  Auld Lang Syne to bring the evening to an end.",
