  "textBody" : "Gamma (uppercase , lowercase  ;  g√°mma) is the third letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 3. In Ancient Greek, the letter gamma represented a voiced velar stop. In Modern Greek, this letter represents either a voiced velar fricative or a voiced palatal fricative.\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet and other modern Latin-alphabet based phonetic notations, it represents the voiced velar fricative.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Greek letter Gamma Œì was derived from the Phoenician letter for the /g/ phoneme ( gƒ´ml), and as such is cognate with Hebrew gimel ◊í.\n\nBased on its name, the letter has been interpreted as an abstract representation of a camel's neck, but this has been criticized as contrived, and it is more likely that the letter is derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing a club or throwing stick.\n\nIn Archaic Greece, the shape of gamma was closer to a classical lambda (Œõ), while lambda retained the Phoenician L-shape ().\n\nLetters that arose from the Greek gamma include Etruscan (Old Italic) êåÇ,  Roman C and G, Runic kaunan , Gothic geuua , the Coptic ‚≤Ñ, and the Cyrillic letters –ì and “ê.\n\nGreek phoneme\n\nThe Ancient Greek /g/ phoneme was the voiced velar stop, continuing the reconstructed proto-Indo-European *g, *«µ.\n\nThe modern Greek phoneme represented by gamma is realized either as a voiced palatal fricative before a front vowel (/e/, /i/), or as a voiced velar fricative in all other environments. Both in Ancient and in Modern Greek, before other velar consonants (Œ∫, œá, Œæ k, kh, ks), gamma represents a velar nasal.
