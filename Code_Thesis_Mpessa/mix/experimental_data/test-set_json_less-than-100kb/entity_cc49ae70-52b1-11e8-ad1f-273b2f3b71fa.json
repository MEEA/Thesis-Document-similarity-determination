  "textBody" : "Barcelonnette (; ) is a commune of France and a subprefecture in the department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. It is located in the southern French Alps, at the crossroads between Provence, Piedmont and the Dauphiné, and is the largest town in the Ubaye Valley. The town's inhabitants are known as Barcelonnettes.\n\nToponymy\n\nBarcelonnette was founded and named in 1231, by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence.Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, Éd. Larousse, 1968, pp. 1693–1694. While the town's name is generally seen as a diminutive form of Barcelona in Catalonia, Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing point out an earlier attestation of the name Barcilona in Barcelonnette in around 1200, and suggest that it is derived instead from two earlier stems signifying a mountain, *bar and *cin (the latter of which is also seen in the name of Mont Cenis).Charles Rostaing, Essai sur la toponymie de la Provence (depuis les origines jusqu’aux invasions barbares, Laffite Reprints, Marseille, 1973 (1st edition 1950), p 91Ernest Nègre, Toponymie générale de la France : étymologie de 35 000 noms de lieux, Genève : Librairie Droz, 1990. Collection Publications romanes et françaises, volume CVCIII. Volume III : Formations dialectales (suite) ; formations françaises § 30208 § 30208\n\nIn the Vivaro-Alpine dialect of Occitan, the town is known as Barcilona de Provença or more rarely Barciloneta according to the classical norm; under the Mistralian norm it is called Barcilouna de Prouvença or Barcilouneto. In Valéian (the dialect of Occitan spoken in the Ubaye Valley), it is called Barcilouna de Prouvença or Barcilounéta.François Arnaud, Gabriel Maurin, Le langage de la vallée de Barcelonnette, Paris : Champion, 1920 - Re-edited in 1973, Marseille: Laffitte ReprintsJean-Rémy Fortoul, Ubaye, la mémoire de mon pays : les gens, les bêtes, les choses, le temps, Barcelonnette: Sabença de la Valeia/Mane: Alpes de Lumière, 1995. ;  Barcino Nova is the town's Latin name meaning \"new Barcelona\"; Barcino was the Roman name for Barcelona in Catalonia from its foundation by Emperor Augustus in 10 BC,[http://www.bcn.cat/historia/pag/capitols/cap_02/en/capitol_02.htm Chapter 2: Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino, Romans at Mons Taber], Town Hall of Barcelona and it was only changed to Barcelona in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town are called Barcelonnettes, or Vilandroises in Valéian.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Barcelonnette region was populated by Ligures from the 1st millennium BC onwards, and the arrival of the Celts several centuries later led to the formation of a mixed Celto-Ligurian people, the Vesubians. Polybius described the Vesubians as belligerent but nonetheless civilised and mercantile, and Julius Caesar praised their bravery.Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette, p.12 and p.15[https://books.google.com/books?idZzsXAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA30&dq%C3%A9subiens&as_brr\n3&hlfr#PPA31,M1 Recherche sur la géographie ancienne et les antiquités du département des Basses-Alpes], p. 30, le col de la Magdeleine étant l'ancien nom du col de Larche, Colle della Maddalena in Italian.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nAncBAAAAQAAJ&pgPA115&lpg\nPA115&dq%C3%89subiens&source\nbl&ots8zRprnJyqt&sig\nA4Az5L3mNRIY82XPg_F3ZILrUT0&hlfr&ei\nP5L1Sfm5OcnOjAeq5P3ADA&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n5 Dictionnaire historique et topographique de la Provence ancienne et moderne], page 115 The work History of the Gauls also places the Vesubians in the Ubaye Valley.[https://books.google.com/books?idM8oWAAAAQAAJ&pg\nRA2-PA218&dqubaye&lr\n&as_brr=1 Histoire des Gaules, et des conquêtes des Gaulois depuis leur origine jusqu'à la fondation de la Monarchie française], 1754\n\nFollowing the Roman conquest of Provence, Barcelonnette was included in a small province with modern Embrun as its capital and governed by Albanus Bassalus. This was integrated soon afterwards into Gallia Narbonensis.Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette, p.16 In 36 AD, Emperor Nero transferred Barcelonnette to the province of the Cottian Alps. The town was known as Rigomagensium under the Roman Empire and was the capital of a civitas (a provincial subdivision),Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, Digne, Imprimerie Louis Jean, 1986, p. 15 though no Roman money has yet been found in the canton of Barcelonnette.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 37\n\nMedieval town\n\nThe town of Barcelonnette was founded in 1231 by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal \"foundation\", according certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of Barcilona. The town was afforded a consulat (giving it the power to administer and defend itself) in 1240.Under the direction of Édouard Baratier, Georges Duby, and Ernest Hildesheimer, Atlas historique. Provence, Comtat Venaissin, principauté d’Orange, comté de Nice, principauté de Monaco, Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1969, p. 163\n\nControl of the area in the Middle Ages swung between the Counts of Savoy and of Provence. In 1388, after Count Louis II of Provence had left to conquer Naples, the Count of Savoy Amadeus VIII took control of Barcelonnette; however, it returned to Provençal control in 1390, with the d'Audiffret family as its lords. On the death of Louis II in 1417 it reverted to Savoy, and, although Count René again retook the area for Provence in 1471, it had returned to Savoyard dominance by the start of the 16th century, by which point the County of Provence had become united with the Kingdom of France due to the death of Count Charles V in 1481.[https://books.google.com/books?id7DQOAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA674 Google Books: Aristide Mathieu Guilbert, Histoire des Villes de France. First book, pp. 674-676, Paris, 1844]\n\nAncien Régime\n\nDuring Charles V's invasion of Provence in 1536, Francis I of France sent the Count of Fürstenberg's 6000 Landsknechte to ravage the area in a scorched earth policy. Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley remained under French sovereignty until the second Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis on 3 April 1559.\n\nIn 1588 the troops of François, Duke of Lesdiguières entered the town and set fire to the church and convent during their campaign against the Duke of Savoy. In 1600, after the Treaty of Vervins, conflict returned between Henry IV of France and Savoy, and Lesdiguières retook Barcelonnette until the conclusion of the Treaty of Lyon on 17 January the following year. In 1628, during the War of the Mantuan Succession, Barcelonnette and the other towns of the Ubaye Valley were pillaged and burned by Jacques du Blé d'Uxelles and his troops, as they passed through towards Italy to the Duke of Mantua's aid. The town was retaken by the Duke of Savoy in 1630; and in 1691 it was captured by the troops of the Marquis de Vins during the War of the League of Augsburg.\n\nBetween 1614 and 1713, Barcelonnette was the seat of one of the four prefectures under the jurisdiction of the Senate of Nice.[http://jc.clariond.free.fr/dixneuf.html#19p4 Histoire d'Allos : la préfecture de Barcelonnette] At this time, the community of Barcelonnette successfully purchased the seigneurie of the town as it was put to auction by the Duke of Savoy; it thereby gained its own justicial powers.Jean Nicolas, La Rébellion française : mouvements populaires et conscience sociale, 1661-1789, Paris: Gallimard, 2008.

The patriotic society of the commune was one of the first 21 created in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in spring 1792, by the envoys of the departmental administration.Alphand, \"Les Sociétés populaires\", pp. 296–301 Around a third of the male population attended at the club.Alphand, \"Les Sociétés populaires\", p. 320 Another episode of political violence occurred in August 1792.\n\nBarcelonnette was the seat of the District of Barcelonnette from 1790 to 1800.\n\nModern history\n\nIn December 1851, the town was home to a movement of republican resistance towards Napoleon III's coup. Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the maison d'arrêt. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of Jausiers and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Brès, and Mayor Signoret of Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in L'Argentière in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).\n\nBetween 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of emigration to Mexico. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the Liverpool department store chain in Mexico; Marcelo Ebrard, the head of government of Mexico City from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as maisons mexicaines), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930. A plaque in the town commemorates the deaths of ten Mexican citizens who returned to Barcelonnette to fight in the First World War.\n\nDuring the Second World War, 26 Jews were arrested in Barcelonnette before being deported.AJPN, \"[http://www.ajpn.org/departement-Alpes-de-Haute-Provence-4.html Département des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence en 1939-1945]\", Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France, accessed 25 May 2012 The 89th compagnie de travailleurs étrangers (Company of Foreign Workers), consisting of foreigners judged as undesirable by the Third Republic and the Vichy regime and committed to forced labour, was established in Barcelonnette.AJPN, \"[http://www.ajpn.org/internement-89e-CTE-574.html 89e CTE]\", Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France, accessed 27 May 2012Josette Lesueur, Gérard Lesueur, Les travailleurs espagnols en Ubaye, 1939-1940, Barcelonnette, Sabença de la Valeia, 2010, collection \"Cahiers de la Vallée\", , p. 11\n\nThe 11th Battalion of Chasseurs alpins was garrisoned at Barcelonnette between 1948 and 1990.Conseil général des AHP, \"Un second souffle pour l’Ubaye?\", Le Magazine du conseil général, no. 70 June 2009, p. 6\n\nGeography\n\nBarcelonnette is situated in the wide and fertile Ubaye Valley, of which it is the largest town.

There are on average almost 300 days of sun and 700 mm of rain per year.\n\nHazards\n\nNone of the 200 communes of the department is entirely free of seismic risk; the canton of Barcelonnette is placed in zone 1b (low risk) by the determinist classification of 1991 based on seismic history,Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, [http://www.alpes-de-haute-provence.pref.gouv.fr/pages/themes/defense/securite%20civile/index.html#menu1 Dossier départemental sur les risques majeurs dans les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]  (DDRM), 2008, p. 39 and zone 4 (average risk) according to the probabilistic EC8 classification of 2011.Minister of Ecology, Sustainable development, transport and housing, [http://macommune.prim.net/d_commune.php?insee04019 Notice communale]  on the Gaspar database, uploaded 8 July 2011, accessed 30 June 2012 The commune is also vulnerable to avalanches, forest fires, floods, and landslides.

The old hospital in the town dates from 1717.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 434\n* The old gendarmerie on Place Manuel was originally constructed to house the subprefecture in 1825 in a neoclassical style, and its façade occupies one entire side of the square. Place Manuel was named after the Restoration politician Jacques-Antoine Manuel; the fountain in the centre of the square contains his image sculpted by David d'Angers.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 533\n* The parish church was originally built in the Middle Ages, but was destroyed in the fire of 1628. It was quickly reconstructed between 1634 and 1638, and further between 1643 and 1644. This was later demolished in 1926-27 to allow the construction of the current church, though this still contains the steeple from the 17th-century reconstruction.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, pp. 193 and 392-393\n* The Cardinalis tower was constructed in the 14th century as a bell tower for the Dominican convent, which was founded on the bequest of Hugh of Saint-Cher. It was damaged in the wars of the 17th century and was rebuilt, though parts still exist from the original construction. It is classed as a monument historique of France.\n\nThe subprefecture has been situated since 1978 in a maison mexicaine, the Villa l'Ubayette, constructed between 1901 and 1903.\n\nPopulation\n\nIn 1471, the community of Barcelonnette (including several surrounding parishes) comprised 421 fires (households). In 1765, it had 6674 inhabitants, but emigration, particularly to Mexico, slowed the town's growth in the period before the Second World War. According to the census of 2007, Barcelonnette has a population of 2766 (municipal population) or 2939 (total)04019-Barcelonnette, insee.fr across a total of 16.42 km2. The town is characterised by low population density. Between 1990 and 1999 the town's annual mean population growth was -0.6%,http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/DL/DEP/04/COM/DL_COM04019.pdf though between 1999 and 2007 this increased to an average of -0.1%.http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/DEP/04/COM/RS_COM04019.pdf\n\nEconomy\n\nThe city is mainly a tourist and resort centre, serving many ski lodges. The Pra-Loup resort is 7 km from Barcelonnette; Le Sauze is 5 km away. It and the Ubaye Valley are served by the Barcelonnette – Saint-Pons Airfield. Notably, Barcelonnette is the only subprefecture of France not served by rail transport; the Ubaye line which would have linked Chorges to Barcelonnette was never completed as a result of the First World War and the construction of the Serre-Ponçon Dam between 1955 and 1961.\n\nEducation\n\nAn école normale (an institute for training primary school teachers) was founded in Barcelonnette in 1833, and remained there until 1888 when it was transferred to Digne.Th.

This was integrated soon afterwards into Gallia Narbonensis.Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette, p.16 In 36 AD, Emperor Nero transferred Barcelonnette to the province of the Cottian Alps. The town was known as Rigomagensium under the Roman Empire and was the capital of a civitas (a provincial subdivision),Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, Digne, Imprimerie Louis Jean, 1986, p. 15 though no Roman money has yet been found in the canton of Barcelonnette.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 37\n\nMedieval town\n\nThe town of Barcelonnette was founded in 1231 by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal \"foundation\", according certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of Barcilona. The town was afforded a consulat (giving it the power to administer and defend itself) in 1240.Under the direction of Édouard Baratier, Georges Duby, and Ernest Hildesheimer, Atlas historique. Provence, Comtat Venaissin, principauté d’Orange, comté de Nice, principauté de Monaco, Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1969, p. 163\n\nControl of the area in the Middle Ages swung between the Counts of Savoy and of Provence. In 1388, after Count Louis II of Provence had left to conquer Naples, the Count of Savoy Amadeus VIII took control of Barcelonnette; however, it returned to Provençal control in 1390, with the d'Audiffret family as its lords. On the death of Louis II in 1417 it reverted to Savoy, and, although Count René again retook the area for Provence in 1471, it had returned to Savoyard dominance by the start of the 16th century, by which point the County of Provence had become united with the Kingdom of France due to the death of Count Charles V in 1481.[https://books.google.com/books?id7DQOAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA674 Google Books: Aristide Mathieu Guilbert, Histoire des Villes de France. First book, pp. 674-676, Paris, 1844]\n\nAncien Régime\n\nDuring Charles V's invasion of Provence in 1536, Francis I of France sent the Count of Fürstenberg's 6000 Landsknechte to ravage the area in a scorched earth policy. Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley remained under French sovereignty until the second Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis on 3 April 1559.\n\nIn 1588 the troops of François, Duke of Lesdiguières entered the town and set fire to the church and convent during their campaign against the Duke of Savoy. In 1600, after the Treaty of Vervins, conflict returned between Henry IV of France and Savoy, and Lesdiguières retook Barcelonnette until the conclusion of the Treaty of Lyon on 17 January the following year. In 1628, during the War of the Mantuan Succession, Barcelonnette and the other towns of the Ubaye Valley were pillaged and burned by Jacques du Blé d'Uxelles and his troops, as they passed through towards Italy to the Duke of Mantua's aid. The town was retaken by the Duke of Savoy in 1630; and in 1691 it was captured by the troops of the Marquis de Vins during the War of the League of Augsburg.\n\nBetween 1614 and 1713, Barcelonnette was the seat of one of the four prefectures under the jurisdiction of the Senate of Nice.[http://jc.clariond.free.fr/dixneuf.html#19p4 Histoire d'Allos : la préfecture de Barcelonnette] At this time, the community of Barcelonnette successfully purchased the seigneurie of the town as it was put to auction by the Duke of Savoy; it thereby gained its own justicial powers.Jean Nicolas, La Rébellion française : mouvements populaires et conscience sociale, 1661-1789, Paris: Gallimard, 2008.

Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the maison d'arrêt. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of Jausiers and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Brès, and Mayor Signoret of Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in L'Argentière in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).\n\nBetween 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of emigration to Mexico. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the Liverpool department store chain in Mexico; Marcelo Ebrard, the head of government of Mexico City from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as maisons mexicaines), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930. A plaque in the town commemorates the deaths of ten Mexican citizens who returned to Barcelonnette to fight in the First World War.\n\nDuring the Second World War, 26 Jews were arrested in Barcelonnette before being deported.AJPN, \"[http://www.ajpn.org/departement-Alpes-de-Haute-Provence-4.html Département des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence en 1939-1945]\", Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France, accessed 25 May 2012 The 89th compagnie de travailleurs étrangers (Company of Foreign Workers), consisting of foreigners judged as undesirable by the Third Republic and the Vichy regime and committed to forced labour, was established in Barcelonnette.AJPN, \"[http://www.ajpn.org/internement-89e-CTE-574.html 89e CTE]\", Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France, accessed 27 May 2012Josette Lesueur, Gérard Lesueur, Les travailleurs espagnols en Ubaye, 1939-1940, Barcelonnette, Sabença de la Valeia, 2010, collection \"Cahiers de la Vallée\", , p. 11\n\nThe 11th Battalion of Chasseurs alpins was garrisoned at Barcelonnette between 1948 and 1990.Conseil général des AHP, \"Un second souffle pour l’Ubaye?\", Le Magazine du conseil général, no. 70 June 2009, p. 6\n\nGeography\n\nBarcelonnette is situated in the wide and fertile Ubaye Valley, of which it is the largest town.

Barcelonnette is situated 210 km from Turin, 91 km from Nice and 68 km from Gap.Votre entreprise à Barcelonnette, Les distances, barcelonnette.com\n\nBiodiversity\n\nAs a result of its relief and geographic situation, the Ubaye Valley has an \"abundance of plant and animal species\".[http://www.mercantour.eu/index.php/Vallee-de-l-Ubaye.html « Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »], www.mercantour.eu The fauna is largely constituted of golden eagles, marmots, ibex and vultures, and the flora includes a large proportion of larches, génépis and white asphodels.\n\nClimate\n\nThe Ubaye Valley has an alpine climate and winters are harsh as a result of the altitude,[http://www.laprovence.com/article/alpes-de-haute-provence « Alpes-de-Haute-Provence »], www.laprovence.com, 19 juin 2007. but there are only light winds as a result of the relief. There are on average almost 300 days of sun and 700 mm of rain per year.\n\nHazards\n\nNone of the 200 communes of the department is entirely free of seismic risk; the canton of Barcelonnette is placed in zone 1b (low risk) by the determinist classification of 1991 based on seismic history,Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, [http://www.alpes-de-haute-provence.pref.gouv.fr/pages/themes/defense/securite%20civile/index.html#menu1 Dossier départemental sur les risques majeurs dans les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]  (DDRM), 2008, p. 39 and zone 4 (average risk) according to the probabilistic EC8 classification of 2011.Minister of Ecology, Sustainable development, transport and housing, [http://macommune.prim.net/d_commune.php?insee04019 Notice communale]  on the Gaspar database, uploaded 8 July 2011, accessed 30 June 2012 The commune is also vulnerable to avalanches, forest fires, floods, and landslides.

The old hospital in the town dates from 1717.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 434\n* The old gendarmerie on Place Manuel was originally constructed to house the subprefecture in 1825 in a neoclassical style, and its façade occupies one entire side of the square. Place Manuel was named after the Restoration politician Jacques-Antoine Manuel; the fountain in the centre of the square contains his image sculpted by David d'Angers.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, p. 533\n* The parish church was originally built in the Middle Ages, but was destroyed in the fire of 1628. It was quickly reconstructed between 1634 and 1638, and further between 1643 and 1644. This was later demolished in 1926-27 to allow the construction of the current church, though this still contains the steeple from the 17th-century reconstruction.Raymond Collier, La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique, pp. 193 and 392-393\n* The Cardinalis tower was constructed in the 14th century as a bell tower for the Dominican convent, which was founded on the bequest of Hugh of Saint-Cher. It was damaged in the wars of the 17th century and was rebuilt, though parts still exist from the original construction. It is classed as a monument historique of France.\n\nThe subprefecture has been situated since 1978 in a maison mexicaine, the Villa l'Ubayette, constructed between 1901 and 1903.\n\nPopulation\n\nIn 1471, the community of Barcelonnette (including several surrounding parishes) comprised 421 fires (households). In 1765, it had 6674 inhabitants, but emigration, particularly to Mexico, slowed the town's growth in the period before the Second World War. According to the census of 2007, Barcelonnette has a population of 2766 (municipal population) or 2939 (total)04019-Barcelonnette, insee.fr across a total of 16.42 km2. The town is characterised by low population density. Between 1990 and 1999 the town's annual mean population growth was -0.6%,http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/DL/DEP/04/COM/DL_COM04019.pdf though between 1999 and 2007 this increased to an average of -0.1%.http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/DEP/04/COM/RS_COM04019.pdf\n\nEconomy\n\nThe city is mainly a tourist and resort centre, serving many ski lodges. The Pra-Loup resort is 7 km from Barcelonnette; Le Sauze is 5 km away. It and the Ubaye Valley are served by the Barcelonnette – Saint-Pons Airfield. Notably, Barcelonnette is the only subprefecture of France not served by rail transport; the Ubaye line which would have linked Chorges to Barcelonnette was never completed as a result of the First World War and the construction of the Serre-Ponçon Dam between 1955 and 1961.\n\nEducation\n\nAn école normale (an institute for training primary school teachers) was founded in Barcelonnette in 1833, and remained there until 1888 when it was transferred to Digne.Th.
