Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as \"WID\" and \"ZOF\" (CVCs or Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the \"forgetting curve\". From his discovery regarding the \"forgetting curve\", Ebbinghaus came up with the effects of \"overlearning\". Essentially, if you practiced something more than what is usually necessary to memorize it, you would have effectively achieved overlearning. Overlearning ensures that information is more impervious to being lost or forgotten, and the forgetting curve for this overlearned material is shallower.\"Human Memory. Herman Ebbinghaus\".

He further hypothesized that the basal forgetting rate differs little between individuals.  He concluded that the difference in performance (e.g. at school) can be explained by mnemonic representation skills.\n\nHe went on to hypothesize that basic training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome those differences in part. He asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:\n# better memory representation (e.g. with mnemonic techniques)\n# repetition based on active recall (especially spaced repetition).\nHis premise was that each repetition in learning increases the optimum interval before the next repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions may need to be made within days, but later they can be made after years). Later research suggested that, other than the two factors Ebbinghaus proposed, higher original learning would also produce slower forgetting.\n\nSpending time each day to remember information, such as that for exams, will greatly decrease the effects of the forgetting curve. Reviewing material in the first 24 hours after learning information is the optimum time to re-read notes and reduce the amount of knowledge forgotten.\n\nSome memories remain free from the detrimental effects of interference and don’t necessarily follow the typical forgetting curve as various noise and outside factors influence what information would be remembered.\n\nThere is debate among supporters of the hypothesis about the shape of the curve for events and facts that are more significant to the subject.[http://www.trainingindustry.com/wiki/entries/forgetting-curve.aspx Forgetting Curve | Training Industry] Some supporters, for example, suggest that memories of shocking events such as the Kennedy Assassination or 9/11 are vividly imprinted in memory (flashbulb memory).
