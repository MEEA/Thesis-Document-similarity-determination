  "textBody" : "Haddocks' Eyes is a term for the name of a poem by Lewis Carroll from Through the Looking-Glass. It is sung by The White Knight in chapter eight to a tune that he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as \"I give thee all, I can no more\".\n\nBy the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.\n\nIt parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of \"Resolution and Independence\" by William Wordsworth.\n\nNaming\n\nThe White Knight explains a confusing nomenclature for the song.\n\n*The song's name is called Haddocks' Eyes\n*The song's name is The Aged Aged Man\n*The song is called Ways and Means\n*The song is A-sitting on a Gate\n\nThe complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the use–mention distinction.\n\nThe Poem\n\nI'll tell thee everything I can:\n    There's little to relate.\nI saw an aged aged man,\n    A-sitting on a gate.\n\"Who are you, aged man?\" I said,\n    \"And how is it you live?\"\nAnd his answer trickled through my head,\n    Like water through a sieve.\n    \nHe said \"I look for butterflies\n    That sleep among the wheat:\nI make them into mutton-pies,\n    And sell them in the street.\nI sell them unto men,\" he said,\n    \"Who sail on stormy seas;\nAnd that's the way I get my bread –\n    A trifle, if you please.\"\n    \nBut I was thinking of a plan\n    To dye one's whiskers green,\nAnd always use so large a fan\n    That they could not be seen.\nSo, having no reply to give\n    To what the old man said,\nI cried \"Come, tell me how you live!\"\n    And thumped him on the head.\n    \nHis accents mild took up the tale:\n    He said \"I go my ways,\nAnd when I find a mountain-rill,\n    I set it in a blaze;\nAnd thence they make a stuff they call\n    Rowlands' Macassar-Oil –\nYet twopence-halfpenny is all\n    They give me for my toil.\"\n    \nBut I was thinking of a way\n    To feed oneself on batter,\nAnd so go on from day to day\n    Getting a little fatter.\nI shook him well from side to side,\n    Until his face was blue:\n\"Come, tell me how you live,\" I cried,\n    \"And what it is you do!\"\n    \nHe said \"I hunt for haddocks' eyes\n    Among the heather bright,\nAnd work them into waistcoat-buttons\n    In the silent night.\nAnd these I do not sell for gold\n    Or coin of silvery shine,\nBut for a copper halfpenny,\n    And that will purchase nine.\n    \n\"I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,\n    Or set limed twigs for crabs:\nI sometimes search the grassy knolls\n    For wheels of Hansom-cabs.\nAnd that's the way\" (he gave a wink)\n    \"By which I get my wealth--\nAnd very gladly will I drink\n    Your Honour's noble health.\"\n    \nI heard him then, for I had just\n    Completed my design\nTo keep the Menai bridge from rust\n    By boiling it in wine.\nI thanked him much for telling me\n    The way he got his wealth,\nBut chiefly for his wish that he\n    Might drink my noble health.\n    \nAnd now, if e'er by chance I put\n    My fingers into glue,\nOr madly squeeze a right-hand foot\n    Into a left-hand shoe,\n    \nOr if I drop upon my toe\n    A very heavy weight,\nI weep, for it reminds me so\nOf that old man I used to know--\nWhose look was mild, whose speech was slow\nWhose hair was whiter than the snow,\nWhose face was very like a crow,\nWith eyes, like cinders, all aglow,\nWho seemed distracted with his woe,\nWho rocked his body to and fro,\nAnd muttered mumblingly and low,\nAs if his mouth were full of dough,\nWho snorted like a buffalo--\nThat summer evening long ago,\n    A-sitting on a gate.\n\nUpon the Lonely Moor\n\nLike \"Jabberwocky,\" another poem published in Through the Looking Glass, \"Haddocks’ Eyes\" appears to have been revised over the course of many years.
