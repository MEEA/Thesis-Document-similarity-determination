  "textBody" : "A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. \nA cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is also termed a saltire in heraldic terminology.\n\nName \n\nThe word cross is recorded in 10th-century Old English as cros, exclusively for the instrument of Christ's crucifixion, replacing the native Old English word rood. The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin crux (or its accusative crucem and its genitive crucis), \"stake, cross\". The English verb to cross arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense \"to make the sign of the cross\"; the generic meaning \"to intersect\" develops in the 15th century.\nThe Latin word was, however, influenced by popular etymology by a native Germanic word reconstructed as *krukjo (English crook, Old English crycce, Old Norse krokr, Old High German krucka). This word, by conflation with Latin crux, gave rise to Old French crocier (modern French crosse), the term for a shepherd's crook, adopted in English as crosier.\n\nLatin crux referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D117%3Aentry%3Dcrux Lewish and Short, A Latin Dictionary: crux] From this word was derived the Latin verb crucio \"to put to death on the cross\" or (more frequently) \"to put to the rack, to torture, torment\" especially in reference to mental troubles.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D116%3Aentry%3Dcrucio Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary: crucio] The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of crux.[http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/crux002.pdf Gunnar Samuelsson, Crucifixion in Antiquity (Mohr Siebeck 2011), p. 203] A crux can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (crux simplex) to the various composite kinds of cross (crux compacta) made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional †-shaped cross (the crux immissa), but also the T-shaped cross (the crux commissa or Tau Cross), which the Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the crux decussata or saltire).\n\nThe Greek equivalent of Latin crux \"stake, gibbet\" is σταυρός stauros, found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross, which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter tau (Τ).[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.vi.ii.ix.html The Epistle of Barnabas, IX][http://logoslibrary.org/clement/stromata/611.html Clement of Alexandria, The Stromata, book VI, chapter 11][http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.marcionem3.shtml Adversus Marcionem, liber III, cap.

Speculation of this kind became especially popular in the mid- to late-19th century in the context of comparative mythology seeking to tie Christian mythology to ancient cosmological myths.

Pars crucis est omne robur, quod erecta statione defigitur; nos, si forte, integrum et totum deum colimus. Diximus originem deorum vestrorum a plastis de cruce induci. \nIn his book De Corona, written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign\" ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html De Corona, chapter 3])\n\nWhile early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross and Latin cross, i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of Late Antiquity. An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (6th century). \nThe Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century.\nA wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of heraldry beginning in the age of the Crusades.William Wood Seymour, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/360/mode/2up \"The Cross in Heraldry\"],  The Cross in Tradition, History, and Art (1898).\n\nCross-like marks and graphemes \n\nThe cross mark is used to mark a position, or as a check mark, but also to mark deletion.\nDerived from Greek Chi are the Latin letter X, Cyrillic Kha and possibly runic Gyfu.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs involving cross shapes include  ankh \"life\",  ndj \"protect\" and nfr \"good; pleasant, beautiful\".\n\nSumerian cuneiform had a simple cross-shaped character, consisting of a horizontal and a vertical wedge (𒈦), read as maš \"tax, yield, interest\"; the superposition of two diagonal wedges results in a decussate cross (𒉽), read as pap \"first, pre-eminent\" (the superposition of these two types of crosses results in the eight-pointed star used as the sign for \"sky\" or \"deity\" (𒀭), DINGIR).\nThe cuneiform script has other, more complex, cruciform characters, consisting of an arrangement of boxes or the fourfold arrangement of other characters, including the archaic cuneiform characters LAK-210, LAK-276, LAK-278, LAK-617 and the classical sign EZEN (𒂡).An example of a cruciform arrangement of a character that is itself cruciform is the ligature \"EZEN x KASKAL squared\", encoded by Unicode at U+120AD (𒂭).\n\nPhoenician tāw is still cross-shaped in  Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and in some Old Italic scripts (Raetic and Lepontic), and its descendant T becomes again cross-shaped in the Latin  minuscule  t. \nThe plus sign   (+) is derived from Latin t via a simplification of a ligature for et \"and\" (introduced by Johannes Widmann in the late 15th century).\n\nThe letter Aleph is cross-shaped in Aramaic and paleo-Hebrew.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs with cross-shapes include Gardiner Z9 – Z11 (\"crossed sticks\", \"crossed planks\").\n\nOther, unrelated cross-shaped letters include Brahmi ka (predecessor of the Devanagari letter क) and Old Turkic (Orkhon) d² and Old Hungarian b, and Katakana ナ na and  メme.\n\nThe   multiplication sign   (×), often attributed to  William Oughtred (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier's Descriptio) apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.Florian Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notations\nDover Books on Mathematics (1929), [https://books.google.ch/books?id_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA251  251f.]\n\nOther typographical symbols resembling crosses include the dagger or obelus (†), \nthe  Chinese (十, Kangxi radical 24) and Roman () ten.\n\nUnicode has a variety of cross symbols in the \"Dingbat\" block (U+2700–U+27BF) : \n✕ ✖ ✗ ✘ ✙ ✚ ✛ ✜ ✝ ✞ ✟ ✠ ✢ ✣ ✤ ✥\nThe Miscellaneous Symbols block (U+2626 to U+262F) adds three specific Christian cross variants, viz. the Patriarchal cross (☦), \nCross of Lorraine (☨) and \"Cross of Jerusalem\" (implemented as Cross potent, ☩).\n\nCross-like emblems \n\nThe following is  a list of cross symbols, except for variants of the Christian cross and Heraldic crosses, for which see the dedicated lists at Christian cross variants and Crosses in heraldry, respectively.\n\n;As a design element\n\nNotable formations known as \"cross\" \n\n*Crux, or the Southern Cross, is a cross-shaped constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. It appears on the national flags of Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea and Samoa.\n*Notable free-standing Christian crosses (or Summit crosses): The tallest cross, at 152.4 metres high, is part of Francisco Franco's monumental \"Valley of the Fallen\", the Monumento Nacional de Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caidos in Spain. A cross at the junction of Interstates 57 and 70 in Effingham, Illinois, is purportedly the tallest in the United States, at 198 feet (60.3 m) tall. The tallest freestanding cross in the United States is located in Saint Augustine, FL and stands 208 feet.\n*The tombs at Naqsh-e Rustam, Iran, made in the 5th century BC, are carved into the cliffside in the shape of a cross.  They are known as the \"Persian crosses\".\n\nPhysical gestures \n\nCross shapes are made by a variety of physical gestures. Crossing the fingers of one hand is a common invocation of the symbol. The sign of the cross associated with Christian genuflection is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.\n\nCrossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the \"cross my heart\" movement associated with making a promise and the Tau shape of the referee's \"time out\" hand signal.\n\nIn Chinese-speaking cultures, crossed index fingers represent the number 10.",

An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (6th century). \nThe Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century.\nA wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of heraldry beginning in the age of the Crusades.William Wood Seymour, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/360/mode/2up \"The Cross in Heraldry\"],  The Cross in Tradition, History, and Art (1898).\n\nCross-like marks and graphemes \n\nThe cross mark is used to mark a position, or as a check mark, but also to mark deletion.\nDerived from Greek Chi are the Latin letter X, Cyrillic Kha and possibly runic Gyfu.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs involving cross shapes include  ankh \"life\",  ndj \"protect\" and nfr \"good; pleasant, beautiful\".\n\nSumerian cuneiform had a simple cross-shaped character, consisting of a horizontal and a vertical wedge (𒈦), read as maš \"tax, yield, interest\"; the superposition of two diagonal wedges results in a decussate cross (𒉽), read as pap \"first, pre-eminent\" (the superposition of these two types of crosses results in the eight-pointed star used as the sign for \"sky\" or \"deity\" (𒀭), DINGIR).\nThe cuneiform script has other, more complex, cruciform characters, consisting of an arrangement of boxes or the fourfold arrangement of other characters, including the archaic cuneiform characters LAK-210, LAK-276, LAK-278, LAK-617 and the classical sign EZEN (𒂡).An example of a cruciform arrangement of a character that is itself cruciform is the ligature \"EZEN x KASKAL squared\", encoded by Unicode at U+120AD (𒂭).\n\nPhoenician tāw is still cross-shaped in  Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and in some Old Italic scripts (Raetic and Lepontic), and its descendant T becomes again cross-shaped in the Latin  minuscule  t. \nThe plus sign   (+) is derived from Latin t via a simplification of a ligature for et \"and\" (introduced by Johannes Widmann in the late 15th century).\n\nThe letter Aleph is cross-shaped in Aramaic and paleo-Hebrew.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs with cross-shapes include Gardiner Z9 – Z11 (\"crossed sticks\", \"crossed planks\").\n\nOther, unrelated cross-shaped letters include Brahmi ka (predecessor of the Devanagari letter क) and Old Turkic (Orkhon) d² and Old Hungarian b, and Katakana ナ na and  メme.\n\nThe   multiplication sign   (×), often attributed to  William Oughtred (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier's Descriptio) apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.Florian Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notations\nDover Books on Mathematics (1929), [https://books.google.ch/books?id_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA251  251f.]\n\nOther typographical symbols resembling crosses include the dagger or obelus (†), \nthe  Chinese (十, Kangxi radical 24) and Roman () ten.\n\nUnicode has a variety of cross symbols in the \"Dingbat\" block (U+2700–U+27BF) : \n✕ ✖ ✗ ✘ ✙ ✚ ✛ ✜ ✝ ✞ ✟ ✠ ✢ ✣ ✤ ✥\nThe Miscellaneous Symbols block (U+2626 to U+262F) adds three specific Christian cross variants, viz. the Patriarchal cross (☦), \nCross of Lorraine (☨) and \"Cross of Jerusalem\" (implemented as Cross potent, ☩).\n\nCross-like emblems \n\nThe following is  a list of cross symbols, except for variants of the Christian cross and Heraldic crosses, for which see the dedicated lists at Christian cross variants and Crosses in heraldry, respectively.\n\n;As a design element\n\nNotable formations known as \"cross\" \n\n*Crux, or the Southern Cross, is a cross-shaped constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. It appears on the national flags of Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea and Samoa.\n*Notable free-standing Christian crosses (or Summit crosses): The tallest cross, at 152.4 metres high, is part of Francisco Franco's monumental \"Valley of the Fallen\", the Monumento Nacional de Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caidos in Spain. A cross at the junction of Interstates 57 and 70 in Effingham, Illinois, is purportedly the tallest in the United States, at 198 feet (60.3 m) tall. The tallest freestanding cross in the United States is located in Saint Augustine, FL and stands 208 feet.\n*The tombs at Naqsh-e Rustam, Iran, made in the 5th century BC, are carved into the cliffside in the shape of a cross.  They are known as the \"Persian crosses\".\n\nPhysical gestures \n\nCross shapes are made by a variety of physical gestures. Crossing the fingers of one hand is a common invocation of the symbol. The sign of the cross associated with Christian genuflection is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.\n\nCrossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the \"cross my heart\" movement associated with making a promise and the Tau shape of the referee's \"time out\" hand signal.\n\nIn Chinese-speaking cultures, crossed index fingers represent the number 10.
