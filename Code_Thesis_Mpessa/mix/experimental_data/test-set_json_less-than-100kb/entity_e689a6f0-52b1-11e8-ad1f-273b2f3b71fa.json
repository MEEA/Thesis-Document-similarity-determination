Retrieved 7 March 2011.R. S. P. Beekes.  Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 324. However, the dā element in the name of Demeter is not so simply equated with \"earth\" according to John Chadwick.Chadwick, The Mycenaean World, Cambridge University Press, 1976, p. 87) \"Every Greek was aware of the maternal functions of Demeter; if her name bore the slightest resemblance to the Greek word for 'mother', it would inevitably have been deformed to emphasize that resemblance.

I (Verlag C.H.Beck) pp 461-462.[https://archive.org/stream/prolegomenatostu00harr#page/272/mode/2up Harisson ,Prolegomena, p.272] Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion (Greek: Πάρεδρος, Paredros) in Mycenaean cult.Dietrich, p.181 The Arcadian cult  links her to the god Poseidon, who probably substituted  the male companion of the Great Goddess ; Demeter may therefore be related to a Minoan Great Goddess (Cybele).Nilsson, 1967:444\n\nAn alternative Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through Potnia and Despoina, where Des- represents a derivative of PIE *dem (house, dome), and Demeter is \"mother of the house\" (from PIE *dems-méh₂tēr).Frisk, Griechisches Etymological Woerterbuch. Entry 1271\n\nAgricultural deity \n\nAccording to the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates, Demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture, particularly of cereals, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.Isocrates, Panegyricus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Isoc.+4+27 4.28]: \"When Demeter came to our land, in her wandering after the rape of Kore, and, being moved to kindness towards our ancestors by services which may not be told save to her initiates, gave these two gifts, the greatest in the world — the fruits of the earth, which have enabled us to rise above the life of the beasts, and the holy rite, which inspires in those who partake of it sweeter hopes regarding both the end of life and all eternity\". These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter's myths and mystery cults. In Homer's Odyssey she is the blond-haired goddess who separates the chaff from the grain.Odyssey 5.499 In Hesiod, prayers to Zeus-Chthonios (chthonic Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong.Hesiod Works and Days, 465 Demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Demeter is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. At the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, Demeter lured Iasion away from the other revelers. They had intercourse in a ploughed furrow in Crete, and she gave birth to a son, Ploutos.Odyssey 5.125; Theogony 969 ff. Her daughter by Zeus was Persephone, Queen of the Underworld.Hesiod, Theogony [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHes.+Th.+912&fromdoc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 912]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D2 Homeric Hymn to Demeter (2)]; Pausnias, Description of Greece [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPaus.%208.37.9&lang=original 8.37.9]\n\nFestivals and cults \n\nDemeter's two major festivals were sacred mysteries. Her Thesmophoria festival (11–13 October) was women-only.Benko, Stephen, The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology, BRILL, 2004, note 111 on pp. 63 - 4, and p. 175. Her Eleusinian mysteries were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as Mother and Persephone as her daughter.\n\nMythology\n\nDemeter and Persephone \n\nDemeter's virgin daughter Persephone was abducted to the underworld by Hades. Demeter searched for her ceaselessly, preoccupied with her loss and her grief. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth, then began to die.Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951, pp.232 - 41 and notes 784 - 98. Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to the underworld to bring Persephone back. Hades agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm; but Persephone had eaten a small number of pomegranate seeds. This bound her to Hades and the underworld for certain months of every year, either the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought,As in Burkert, Greek Religion (Harvard, 1985) p. 160. or the autumn and winter.As in Porphyry There are several variations on the basic myth. In the Homeric hymn to Demeter, Hecate assists in the search and later becomes Persephone's underworld attendant.[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/demeter.html Homer Hymn to Demeter, trans. Gregory Nagy, lines 50 - 60, 438 - 440.] In another, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. Contrary to popular perception, Persephone's time in the underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient Greek calendar, nor her return to the upper world with springtime.Graf, \"Demeter\" in Brill's New Pauly Demeter's descent to retrieve Persephone from the underworld is connected to the Eleusinian Mysteries.\n\nDemeter and her daughter Persephone were usually called:Martin Nilsson (1967) Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion pp.463, 477\n* The goddesses, often distinguished as \"the older\" and \"the younger\" in Eleusis.\n* Demeters, in Rhodes and Sparta\n* The thesmophoroi, \"the legislators\" in the Thesmophoria.\n* The Great Goddesses, in Arcadia.\n* The mistresses in Arcadia.Pausanias.Description of Greece 5.15.4, 5, 6\nIn Mycenaean Pylos, Demeter and Persephone were probably called \"queens\" (wa-na-ssoi).\n\nThe myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version, Ploutos (πλούτος, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (pithoi). Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for funerary practices. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.[http://www.sacred-texts.com|cla gpr Martin Nilsson, Greek Popular Religion. ] pp 48-50\n\nAccording to the personal mythology of Robert Graves,Graves' work on Greek myth was often criticized; see The White Goddess#Criticism and The Greek Myths. Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter,The idea that Kore (the maiden) is not Demeter's daughter, but Demeter's own younger self, was discussed much earlier than Graves, in Lewis Richard Farnell (1896), [https://books.google.com/books?idFKVEsNO6wFYC&pg\nPA121 The Cults of the Greek States, volume 3, p.121.] she is in turn also one of three guises of the Triple Goddess – Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name. Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').Graves, Robert. The Greek Myths. Penguin, 1990. . 24. pp.94–95.\n\nDemeter at Eleusis \n\nDemeter's search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.Nilsson (1940), p. 50: \"The Demophon story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult. It is introduced in order to let Demeter reveal herself in her divine shape\".\n\nDemeter and Poseidon \n\nDemeter and Poseidon's names appear in the earliest scratched notes in Linear B found at Mycenae and Mycenaean Pylos; e-ne-si-da-o-ne (earth-shaker) for Poseidon, and si-to-po-ti-ni-ja, who is probably related with Demeter.George Mylonas (1966), \"Mycenae and the Mycenean world \". p.159. Princeton University Press Poseidon carries frequently the title wa-na-ka (wanax) in Linear B inscriptions, as king of the underworld, and his title  E-ne-si-da-o-ne indicates his chthonic nature. In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) Enesidaon is related with the cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth.Dietrich pp. 181-185 She was related with the annual birth of the divine child.Dietrich pp. 141 During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature, dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cult, and Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion (paredros) in Mycenean cult. She and her paredros survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered : \" Mighty Potnia bore a strong son\"Dietrich:166-167 However, there is no evidence that originally the name of Potnia was Demeter.\n\nTablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for \"the Two Queens and Poseidon\" (\"to the Two Queens and the King\" :wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te). The \"Two Queens\" may be related with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. An exception is the myth of isolated Arcadia in southern Greece. Despoina, is daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios, Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the Bronze age. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with Artemis, the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.\n\nDemeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King Onkios, but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious (erinys) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River Ladon, becoming Demeter Lousia, the \"bathed Demeter\".Other ritually bathed goddesses were Argive Hera and Cybele; Aphrodite renewed her own powers bathing herself in the sea. \"In her alliance with Poseidon,\" Karl Kerenyi noted,Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951:185. \"she was Earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of grain or a mare.\" She bore a daughter Despoina (: the \"Mistress\"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian Mysteries,\"In Arcadia she was also a second goddess in the Mysteries of her daughter, the unnameable, who was invoked only as 'Despoina', the 'Mistress'\" (Karl Kerenyi, Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter(Princeton University Press) 1967:31f, instancing Pausanias, viii.37.9. and a horse named Arion, with a black mane and tail.\n\nIn Arcadia, Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her xoanon of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her: a Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.L. H. Jeffery (1976). Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c. 800-500 B.C. (Ernest Benn Limited) p 23 \n\nTitles and functions \n\nDemeter's epithets show her many religious functions. She was the \"Corn-Mother\" who blesses the harvesters. Some cults interpreted her as \"Mother-Earth\". Demeter may be linked to goddess-cults of Minoan Crete, and embody aspects of a pre-Hellenic Mother Goddess.A Linear A inscription can tentatively be read as DA-MA-TE (KY Za 2), which is possibly the name of the Mother Goddess. [http://www.teicrete.gr/arkalochori/linear-inscription.php]  It is possible that the title \"Mistress of the labyrinth\", which appears in a Linear B inscription, belonged originally to Sito (\"[she] of the grain\"), the Great Mother Demeter and that in the Eleusinian mysteries this title was kept by her daughter Persephone (Kore or Despoina).R.Wunderlich (1975),The secret of Creta.Souvenir Press Ltd.London p 319 However, there is no evidence that the name of Potnia in Eleusis was originally Demeter. Her other epithets include:\n\n* Aganippe (\"the Mare who destroys mercifully\", \"Night-Mare\")\n* Potnia (\"mistress\") in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. Hera especially, but also Artemis and Athena, are addressed as \"potnia\" as well.\n* Despoina (\"mistress of the house\"), a Greek word similar to the Mycenean potnia. This title was also applied to Persephone, Aphrodite and Hecate.\n* Thesmophoros (\"giver of customs\" or even \"legislator\"), a role that links her to the even more ancient goddess Themis, derived from thesmos, the unwritten law.L. H. Jeffery (1976). Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c. 800-500 B.C. (Ernest Benn Limited) p. 42  This title was connected with the Thesmophoria, a festival of secret women-only rituals in Athens connected with marriage customs.\n* Erinys (\"implacable\"),Pausanias 8.25.50 with a function similar with the function of the avenging Dike (Justice), goddess of moral justice based on custom rules who represents the divine retribution,C.M.

[...] How did it escape transformation into *Gāmātēr, a name transparent to any Greek speaker?\" Compare the Latin transformation Iuppiter and Diespiter vis-a-vis *Deus pater..\n\nThe element De- may be connected with Deo, an epithet of DemeterOrphic Hymn 40 to Demeter (translated by Thomas Taylor: \"O universal mother Deo famed, august, the source of wealth and various names\". probably derived from the Cretan word dea (), Ionic zeia ()—variously identified with emmer, spelt, rye, or other grains by modern scholars—so that she is the Mother and the giver of food generally.Compare sanskr. yava, lit. yavai, Δά is probably derived from δέFα :Martin Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, vol. I (Verlag C.H.Beck) pp 461-462.[https://archive.org/stream/prolegomenatostu00harr#page/272/mode/2up Harisson ,Prolegomena, p.272] Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion (Greek: Πάρεδρος, Paredros) in Mycenaean cult.Dietrich, p.181 The Arcadian cult  links her to the god Poseidon, who probably substituted  the male companion of the Great Goddess ; Demeter may therefore be related to a Minoan Great Goddess (Cybele).Nilsson, 1967:444\n\nAn alternative Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through Potnia and Despoina, where Des- represents a derivative of PIE *dem (house, dome), and Demeter is \"mother of the house\" (from PIE *dems-méh₂tēr).Frisk, Griechisches Etymological Woerterbuch. Entry 1271\n\nAgricultural deity \n\nAccording to the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates, Demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture, particularly of cereals, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.Isocrates, Panegyricus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Isoc.+4+27 4.28]: \"When Demeter came to our land, in her wandering after the rape of Kore, and, being moved to kindness towards our ancestors by services which may not be told save to her initiates, gave these two gifts, the greatest in the world — the fruits of the earth, which have enabled us to rise above the life of the beasts, and the holy rite, which inspires in those who partake of it sweeter hopes regarding both the end of life and all eternity\". These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter's myths and mystery cults. In Homer's Odyssey she is the blond-haired goddess who separates the chaff from the grain.Odyssey 5.499 In Hesiod, prayers to Zeus-Chthonios (chthonic Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong.Hesiod Works and Days, 465 Demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Demeter is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. At the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, Demeter lured Iasion away from the other revelers. They had intercourse in a ploughed furrow in Crete, and she gave birth to a son, Ploutos.Odyssey 5.125; Theogony 969 ff. Her daughter by Zeus was Persephone, Queen of the Underworld.Hesiod, Theogony [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHes.+Th.+912&fromdoc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 912]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D2 Homeric Hymn to Demeter (2)]; Pausnias, Description of Greece [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPaus.%208.37.9&lang=original 8.37.9]\n\nFestivals and cults \n\nDemeter's two major festivals were sacred mysteries. Her Thesmophoria festival (11–13 October) was women-only.Benko, Stephen, The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology, BRILL, 2004, note 111 on pp. 63 - 4, and p. 175. Her Eleusinian mysteries were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as Mother and Persephone as her daughter.\n\nMythology\n\nDemeter and Persephone \n\nDemeter's virgin daughter Persephone was abducted to the underworld by Hades. Demeter searched for her ceaselessly, preoccupied with her loss and her grief. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth, then began to die.Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951, pp.232 - 41 and notes 784 - 98. Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to the underworld to bring Persephone back. Hades agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm; but Persephone had eaten a small number of pomegranate seeds. This bound her to Hades and the underworld for certain months of every year, either the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought,As in Burkert, Greek Religion (Harvard, 1985) p. 160. or the autumn and winter.As in Porphyry There are several variations on the basic myth. In the Homeric hymn to Demeter, Hecate assists in the search and later becomes Persephone's underworld attendant.[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/demeter.html Homer Hymn to Demeter, trans. Gregory Nagy, lines 50 - 60, 438 - 440.] In another, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. Contrary to popular perception, Persephone's time in the underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient Greek calendar, nor her return to the upper world with springtime.Graf, \"Demeter\" in Brill's New Pauly Demeter's descent to retrieve Persephone from the underworld is connected to the Eleusinian Mysteries.\n\nDemeter and her daughter Persephone were usually called:Martin Nilsson (1967) Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion pp.463, 477\n* The goddesses, often distinguished as \"the older\" and \"the younger\" in Eleusis.\n* Demeters, in Rhodes and Sparta\n* The thesmophoroi, \"the legislators\" in the Thesmophoria.\n* The Great Goddesses, in Arcadia.\n* The mistresses in Arcadia.Pausanias.Description of Greece 5.15.4, 5, 6\nIn Mycenaean Pylos, Demeter and Persephone were probably called \"queens\" (wa-na-ssoi).\n\nThe myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version, Ploutos (πλούτος, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (pithoi). Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for funerary practices. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.[http://www.sacred-texts.com|cla gpr Martin Nilsson, Greek Popular Religion. ] pp 48-50\n\nAccording to the personal mythology of Robert Graves,Graves' work on Greek myth was often criticized; see The White Goddess#Criticism and The Greek Myths. Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter,The idea that Kore (the maiden) is not Demeter's daughter, but Demeter's own younger self, was discussed much earlier than Graves, in Lewis Richard Farnell (1896), [https://books.google.com/books?idFKVEsNO6wFYC&pg\nPA121 The Cults of the Greek States, volume 3, p.121.] she is in turn also one of three guises of the Triple Goddess – Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name. Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').Graves, Robert. The Greek Myths. Penguin, 1990. . 24. pp.94–95.\n\nDemeter at Eleusis \n\nDemeter's search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.Nilsson (1940), p. 50: \"The Demophon story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult. It is introduced in order to let Demeter reveal herself in her divine shape\".\n\nDemeter and Poseidon \n\nDemeter and Poseidon's names appear in the earliest scratched notes in Linear B found at Mycenae and Mycenaean Pylos; e-ne-si-da-o-ne (earth-shaker) for Poseidon, and si-to-po-ti-ni-ja, who is probably related with Demeter.George Mylonas (1966), \"Mycenae and the Mycenean world \". p.159. Princeton University Press Poseidon carries frequently the title wa-na-ka (wanax) in Linear B inscriptions, as king of the underworld, and his title  E-ne-si-da-o-ne indicates his chthonic nature. In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) Enesidaon is related with the cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth.Dietrich pp. 181-185 She was related with the annual birth of the divine child.Dietrich pp. 141 During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature, dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cult, and Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion (paredros) in Mycenean cult. She and her paredros survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered : \" Mighty Potnia bore a strong son\"Dietrich:166-167 However, there is no evidence that originally the name of Potnia was Demeter.\n\nTablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for \"the Two Queens and Poseidon\" (\"to the Two Queens and the King\" :wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te). The \"Two Queens\" may be related with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. An exception is the myth of isolated Arcadia in southern Greece. Despoina, is daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios, Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the Bronze age. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with Artemis, the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.\n\nDemeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King Onkios, but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious (erinys) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River Ladon, becoming Demeter Lousia, the \"bathed Demeter\".Other ritually bathed goddesses were Argive Hera and Cybele; Aphrodite renewed her own powers bathing herself in the sea. \"In her alliance with Poseidon,\" Karl Kerenyi noted,Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951:185. \"she was Earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of grain or a mare.\" She bore a daughter Despoina (: the \"Mistress\"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian Mysteries,\"In Arcadia she was also a second goddess in the Mysteries of her daughter, the unnameable, who was invoked only as 'Despoina', the 'Mistress'\" (Karl Kerenyi, Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter(Princeton University Press) 1967:31f, instancing Pausanias, viii.37.9. and a horse named Arion, with a black mane and tail.\n\nIn Arcadia, Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her xoanon of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her: a Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.L. H. Jeffery (1976). Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c. 800-500 B.C. (Ernest Benn Limited) p 23 \n\nTitles and functions \n\nDemeter's epithets show her many religious functions. She was the \"Corn-Mother\" who blesses the harvesters. Some cults interpreted her as \"Mother-Earth\". Demeter may be linked to goddess-cults of Minoan Crete, and embody aspects of a pre-Hellenic Mother Goddess.A Linear A inscription can tentatively be read as DA-MA-TE (KY Za 2), which is possibly the name of the Mother Goddess. [http://www.teicrete.gr/arkalochori/linear-inscription.php]  It is possible that the title \"Mistress of the labyrinth\", which appears in a Linear B inscription, belonged originally to Sito (\"[she] of the grain\"), the Great Mother Demeter and that in the Eleusinian mysteries this title was kept by her daughter Persephone (Kore or Despoina).R.Wunderlich (1975),The secret of Creta.Souvenir Press Ltd.London p 319 However, there is no evidence that the name of Potnia in Eleusis was originally Demeter. Her other epithets include:\n\n* Aganippe (\"the Mare who destroys mercifully\", \"Night-Mare\")\n* Potnia (\"mistress\") in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. Hera especially, but also Artemis and Athena, are addressed as \"potnia\" as well.\n* Despoina (\"mistress of the house\"), a Greek word similar to the Mycenean potnia. This title was also applied to Persephone, Aphrodite and Hecate.\n* Thesmophoros (\"giver of customs\" or even \"legislator\"), a role that links her to the even more ancient goddess Themis, derived from thesmos, the unwritten law.L. H. Jeffery (1976). Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c. 800-500 B.C.
