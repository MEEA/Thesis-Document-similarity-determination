  "textBody" : "The Lost Generation was the generation that came of age during World War I. Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe outlined their Strauss–Howe generational theory using 1883–1900 as birth years for this generation. The term was coined by Gertrude Stein and popularized by Ernest Hemingway, who used it as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway credits the phrase to Gertrude Stein, who was then his mentor and patron.\n\nIn literature \n\n In A Moveable Feast, published after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway claims that Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car. When a young mechanic failed to repair the car quickly enough, the garage owner shouted at the boy, \"You are all a \"génération perdue.\" Stein, in telling Hemingway the story, added, \"That is what you are. That's what you all are ... all of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.\" Mellow, James R. (1991). Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company, p,273. New York: Houghton Mifflin. .\n\nLost in this respect means disoriented, wandering, directionless—a recognition that there was great confusion and aimlessness among the war's survivors in the early post-war years.\"\n\nThe 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises popularized the term as Hemingway used it as an epigraph. The novel serves to epitomize the post-war expatriate generation. However, Hemingway later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the \"point of the book\" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that \"the earth abideth forever\"; he believed the characters in The Sun Also Rises may have been \"battered\" but were not lost.\n\nIn his memoir A Moveable Feast, published after his death, he writes \"I tried to balance Miss Stein's quotation from the garage owner with one from Ecclesiastes.\" A few lines later, recalling the risks and losses of the war, he adds: \"I thought of Miss Stein and Sherwood Anderson and egotism and mental laziness versus discipline and I thought 'who is calling who a lost generation?\n\nLiterary themes \n\nThe writings of the Lost Generation literary figures tended to have common themes. These themes mostly pertained to the writers' experiences in World War I and the years following it. It is said that the work of these writers was autobiographical based on their use of mythologized versions of their lives. One of the themes that commonly appears in the authors' works is decadence and the frivolous lifestyle of the wealthy. Both Hemingway and Fitzgerald touch on this theme throughout the novels The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby. Another theme that is common for these authors was the death of the American dream, which is exhibited throughout many of their novels. It is most prominent in The Great Gatsby, in which the character Nick Carraway comes to realize the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nOther uses \n\nThe term is also used in a broader context for the generation of young people who came of age during and shortly after World War I, alternatively known as the World War I generation. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, well known for their generational theory, define the Lost Generation as the cohort born from 1883 to 1900, who came of age during World War I and the Roaring Twenties. In Europe, they are mostly known as the \"Generation of 1914\", for the year World War I began. In France, the country in which many expatriates settled, they were sometimes called the Génération au Feu, the \"Generation in Flames\".\n\nIf one goes by Strauss and Howe's birth years, the last U.S. member of the Lost Generation to live was Susannah Mushatt Jones, who was born on July 6, 1899 and died on May 12, 2016. This makes the generation fully ancestral in the United States. Nabi Tajima (born 4 August 1900) from Japan is believed to be the last living member of this generation.\n\nIn Britain, the term was originally used for those who died in the war, and often implicitly referred to upper-class casualties who were perceived to have died disproportionately, robbing the country of a future elite.

Wallace, British-born film director Alfred Hitchcock, composers George Gershwin and Aaron Copland, and Italian born Nicola Sacco.\n\nBecause the United States was a safe haven from the persecution, repression, and murder characteristic of fascist and Communist regimes, the United States often became a refuge for entrepreneurs, scientists (like Enrico Fermi), and creative people (like Bohuslav Martinů) who did much of their best work in America.\n\nU.S. presidents were Harry S.
