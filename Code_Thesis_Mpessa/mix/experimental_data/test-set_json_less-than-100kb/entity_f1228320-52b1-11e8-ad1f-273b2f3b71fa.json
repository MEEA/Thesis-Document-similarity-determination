  "textBody" : "The Epistle of James (), the Book of James, or simply James, is one of the twenty-one epistles (didactic letters) in the New Testament.\n\nThe author identifies himself as \"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,\" who is writing to \"the twelve tribes scattered abroad\" (James 1:1). The epistle is traditionally attributed to James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), and the audience is generally considered to be Jewish Christians, who were dispersed outside Palestine due to persecution.\n\nFramed within an overall theme of patient perseverance during trials and temptations, James writes to encourage believers to live consistently with what they have learned in Christ. He wants his readers to mature in their faith in Christ by living what they say they believe. He condemns various sins, including pride, hypocrisy, favouritism, and slander. He encourages believers to humbly live by godly rather than worldly wisdom and to pray in all situations.\n\nWithin the New Testament canon, the Epistle of James is noteworthy because it makes no reference to the death, resurrection, or divine sonship of Jesus. It refers to Jesus twice, as \"the Lord Jesus Christ\" and as \"our glorious Lord Jesus Christ\" (James 1:1, 2:1).\n\nAuthorship \n\nAccording to Robert J. Foster, \"there is little consensus as to the genre, structure, dating, and authorship of the book of James.\" There are four \"commonly espoused\" views concerning authorship and dating of the Epistle of James:\n# the letter was written by James before the Pauline Epistles,\n# the letter was written by James after the Pauline Epistles,\n# the letter is pseudonymous,\n# the letter comprises material originally from James but reworked by a later editor.\n\nThe writer refers to himself only as \"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" As many as six different men in the Bible are named James, and if none of them wrote this letter, some other man not mentioned might be the author.\n\nJesus had two apostles named James: James, the son of Zebedee and James, the son of Alphaeus, but it is unlikely that either of these wrote the letter. According to the Book of Acts, James, the son of Zebedee, was martyred about 44 AD.See  That would be very early for him to have been the writer. The other apostle James, the son of Alphaeus, is not prominent in the Scriptural record, and very little is known about him.\n\nRather, evidence points to James, the brother of Jesus, to whom Jesus evidently had made a special appearance after his resurrection described in the New Testament. This James was prominent among the disciples.See ; ;; and ,  The writer of the letter of James identifies himself as \"a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in much the same way as did Jude, who introduced the Epistle of Jude by calling himself \"a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James\" (Jas 1:1; Jude 1). Furthermore, the salutation of his letter concludes with the term “greetings\" (Greek χαίρειν), much like the letter on circumcision that was sent to the congregations.Cf.  and . In the latter instance it was apparently Jesus's brother, James, who spoke prominently in the assembly of \"the apostles and the older men\" at Jerusalem.Adam Clarke,1821, commentary on 5:13, 22, 23.\n\nFrom the middle of the 3rd century, patristic authors cited the Epistle as written by James, the brother of Jesus and a leader of the Jerusalem church. Not numbered among the Twelve Apostles unless he is identified as James the Less, James was nonetheless a very important figure: Paul described him as \"the brother of the Lord\" in Galatians 1:19 and as one of the three \"pillars of the Church\" in 2:9.\n\nPseudonymous authorship (3 above) implies that the person named \"James\" is respected and doubtless well known. Moreover, this James, brother of Jesus, is honored by the epistle written and distributed after the lifetime of James, the brother of Jesus.\n\nJohn Calvin and others suggested that the author was the Apostle James, son of Alphaeus, who is referred to as James the Less. The Protestant reformer Martin Luther denied it was the work of an apostle and termed it an \"epistle of straw\" as compared to some other books in the New Testament, partly because of the conflict he thought it raised with Paul on the doctrine of justification (see below).\n\nDating\n\nMany scholars consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries:\n* The author introduces himself merely as \"a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ\" without invoking any special family relationship to Jesus.\n* The cultured Greek language of the Epistle, it is contended, could not have been written by a Jerusalem Jew. Some scholars argue for a primitive version of the letter composed by James and then later polished by another writer.\n* The epistle was only gradually accepted into the canon of the New Testament.\n* Some see parallels between James and 1 Peter, 1 Clement, and the Shepherd of Hermas and take this to reflect the socio-economic situation Christians were dealing with in the late 1st or early 2nd century. It thus could have been written anywhere in the Empire that Christians spoke Greek. There are some scholars who argued for Syria.\n\nOther scholars, such as Luke Timothy Johnson, suggest an early dating for the Epistle of James:\n\"The Letter of James also, according to the majority of scholars who have carefully worked through its text in the past two centuries, is among the earliest of New Testament compositions. It contains no reference to the events in Jesus' life, but it bears striking testimony to Jesus' words.  Jesus' sayings are embedded in James' exhortations in a form that is clearly not dependent on the written Gospels.\"\n\nIf written by James the brother of Jesus, it would have been written sometime before AD 69 (or AD 62), when he was martyred. Jerusalem would also be the place of writing.\n\nThe earliest extant manuscripts of James usually date to the mid-to-late 3rd century.\n\nGenre\n\nJames is considered New Testament wisdom literature: \"like Proverbs and Sirach, it consists largely of moral exhortations and precepts of a traditional and eclectic nature.\"\n\nThe content of James is directly parallel, in many instances, to sayings of Jesus found in the gospels of Luke and Matthew, i.e., those attributed to the Q Source. Compare, e.g., \"Do not swear at all, either by heaven...or by the earth....Let your word be 'Yes, Yes' or 'No, No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one\" (Matthew 5:34, 37) and \"...do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your 'Yes' be yes and your 'No' be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation\" (James 5:12). According to James Tabor, the epistle of James contains \"no fewer than thirty direct references, echoes, and allusions to the teachings of Jesus found in the Q source.\"\n\nStructure\n\nSome view the epistle as having no overarching outline: \"James may have simply grouped together small 'thematic essays' without having more linear, Greco-Roman structures in mind.\" That view is generally supported by those who believe that the epistle may not be a true piece of correspondence between specific parties but an example of wisdom literature, formulated as a letter for circulation. The Catholic Encyclopedia says, \"the subjects treated of in the Epistle are many and various; moreover, St. James not infrequently, whilst elucidating a certain point, passes abruptly to another, and presently resumes once more his former argument.\"\n\nOthers view the letter as having only broad topical or thematic structure. They generally organize James under three (Ralph Martin) to seven (Luke Johnson) general key themes or segments.\n\nA third group believes that James was more purposeful in structuring his letter, linking each paragraph theologically and thematically:\n\nThe third view of the structuring of James is a historical approach that is supported by scholars who are not content with leaving the book as \"New Testament wisdom literature, like a small book of proverbs\" or \"like a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string.\"Some numerous writers and commentators assume so, like William Barclay, The Daily Study Bible, rev. ed., 17 vols. (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1976), Vol 14, The Letters of James and Peter, p. 28.\n\nA fourth group uses modern discourse analysis or Greco-Roman rhetorical structures to describe the structure of James.\n\nThe United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament divides the letter into the following sections:\n\nHistorical context \n\nUnderstanding the circumstances of James' writing helps scholars better understand James' organization of the letter. They view the epistle as having a legitimate purpose for its composition, a response to the suffering of its recipients.\n\nA 2013 journal articleJim Reiher, \"Violent Language – a clue to the Historical Occasion of James.\" Evangelical Quarterly. Vol. LXXXV No. 3. July 2013 explores a violent historical background behind the epistle and offers the suggestion that it was indeed written by James, the brother of Jesus, and it was written before AD 62, the year he was killed.On the death of James, see Josephus Antiquities, 20.9.1 and Eusebius II.23.1-18. The 50s saw the growth of turmoil and violence in Roman Judea, as Jews became more and more frustrated with corruption, injustice and poverty. It continued into the 60s, four years before James was killed. War broke out with Rome and would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people. The epistle is renowned for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways (1:26–27; 2:1-4; 2:14-19; 5:1-6), standing up for the oppressed (2:1-4; 5:1-6) and not being \"like the world\" in the way one responds to evil in the world (1:26-27; 2:11; 3:13-18; 4:1-10). Worldly wisdom is rejected and people are exhorted to embrace heavenly wisdom, which includes peacemaking and pursuing righteousness and justice (3:13-18).\n\nThis approach sees the epistle as a real letterNumerous studies argue for a letter- structure to James. See, for example, Euan Fry, \"Commentaries on James, I and 2 Peter, and Jude,\" The Bible Translator, 41 (July 1990): 330, and F.O. Francis, \"The Form and Function of the Opening and Closing Paragraphs of James and I John,\" ZNW 61 (1970):110-126. with a real immediate purpose: to encourage Christian Jews not to revert to violence in their response to injustice and poverty but to stay focused on doing good, staying holy and to embrace the wisdom of heaven, not that of the world.\n\nDoctrine \n\nJustification \n\nIt contains the following famous passage concerning salvation and justification:\n\nThat passage has been cited in Christian theological debates, especially regarding the doctrine of justification. Gaius Marius Victorinus (4th century) associated James's teaching on works with the heretical Symmachian sect, followers of Symmachus the Ebionite, and openly questioned whether James' teachings were heretical. This passage has also been contrasted with the teachings of Paul the Apostle on justification. Some scholars even believe that the passage is a response to Paul. One issue in the debate is the meaning of the Greek word δικαιόω (dikaiόō) 'render righteous or such as he ought to be', with some among the participants taking the view that James is responding to a misunderstanding of Paul.Martin, D. 2009. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nBRWj6j2Dswc New Testament History & Literature: 18. Arguing with Paul]. Yale University.\n\nRoman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have historically argued that the passage disproves the doctrine of justification by faith alone (or sola fide), The early and many modern Protestants resolve the apparent conflict between James and Paul regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox:\n\nAnointing of the Sick \n\nThe epistle is also the chief biblical text for the Anointing of the Sick. James wrote:\n\nG. A. Wells suggested that the passage was evidence of late authorship of the epistle, on the grounds that the healing of the sick being done through an official body of presbyters (elders) indicated a considerable development of ecclesiastical organisation \"whereas in Paul's day to heal and work miracles pertained to believers indiscriminately (I Corinthians, XII:9).\"\n\nCanonicity \n\nThe Epistle was first explicitly referred to and quoted by Origen of Alexandria, and possibly a bit earlier by Irenaeus of Lyons as well as Clement of Alexandria in a lost work according to Eusebius, although it was not mentioned by Tertullian, who was writing at the end of the Second Century. It is also absent from the Muratorian fragment, the earliest known list of New Testament books.\n\nThe Epistle of James was included among the twenty-seven New Testament books first listed by Athanasius of Alexandria in his Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle (AD 367) and was confirmed as a canonical epistle of the New Testament by a series of councils in the Fourth Century. Today, virtually all denominations of Christianity consider this book to be a canonical epistle of the New Testament.\n\nIn the first centuries of the Church the authenticity of the Epistle was doubted by some, including Theodore, Bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia. Because of the silence of several of the western churches regarding it, Eusebius classes it among the Antilegomena or contested writings (Historia ecclesiae, 3.25; 2.23). Jerome gives a similar appraisal but adds that with time it had been universally admitted. Gaius Marius Victorinus, in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, openly questioned whether the teachings of James were heretical.\n\nIts late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, may be explained by the fact that it was written for or by Jewish Christians, and therefore not widely circulated among the Gentile Churches. There is some indication that a few groups distrusted the book because of its doctrine. In Reformation times a few theologians, most notably Martin Luther in his early career,The Lutheran Study Bible, Concordia Publishing House, 2009, p2132 argued that this epistle should not be part of the canonical New Testament.\n\nMartin Luther's description of the Epistle of James changes. In some cases, Luther argues that it was not written by an apostle; but in other cases, he describes James as the work of an apostle.Die deutsche Bibel 41:578-90 He even cites it as authoritative teaching from GodLuther's Large Catechism, [http://bookofconcord.org/lc-5-ourfather.php#para123 IV 122-24] and describes James as \"a good book, because it sets up no doctrines of men but vigorously promulgates the law of God.\"Luther's Works (American Edition) 35:395 Lutherans hold that the Epistle is rightly part of the New Testament, citing its authority in the Book of Concord, however it remains part of the Lutheran antilegomena.",
