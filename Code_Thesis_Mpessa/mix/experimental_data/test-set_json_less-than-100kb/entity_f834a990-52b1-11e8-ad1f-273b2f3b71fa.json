  "textBody" : "West Flemish (, ) is a dialect of the Dutch language spoken in western Belgium and adjoining parts of the Netherlands and France.RL Trask, \"Number of Languages\", in Language and Linguistics: The Key Concepts, 2nd ed. 2007\n\nWest Flemish is spoken by about a million people in the Belgian province of West Flanders, and a further 120,000 in the neighbouring Dutch coastal district of Zeelandic Flanders (and another 220,000 if Zealandic is included), and 10,000 in the northern part of the French département of Nord. Some of the main cities where West Flemish is widely spoken are Bruges, Kortrijk, Ostend, Roeselare, and Ypres. The dialects of the rest of the Dutch province of Zeeland, Zeelandic, are often included in West Flemish; these are part of a dialect continuum which proceeds further north into Hollandic.\n\nWest Flemish is listed as a \"vulnerable\" language in UNESCO's online Red Book of Endangered Languages.[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO.org] \n\nDifferences from Standard Dutch \n\nPhonology\n\nWest Flemish phonology differs significantly from the standard Dutch phonology. The best known are the (pre-)velar fricatives g and ch in Dutch, being realised as glottal  h -, and the overall lack of diphthongs compared to Dutch. The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have evolved to the same sound in Dutch, but stayed separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ a bit from region to region.\n\n* sch - is realised as or (sh or sk).\n* ei - is realised as or (è or jè).\n* ij  - is realised as (short ie, also written as y).\n* au - is realised as (ow)\n* ou - is realised as (short oe), it resembles a lot the long \"oe\" that is also used in Dutch, and can cause confusion\n* e - is realised as or.\n* i - is realised as.\n* ie - is longer\n* aa - is realised as.\n\nDue to the non-existent and sounds in West Flemish, native speakers of the dialect have to concentrate a lot to pronounce these sounds. This often results in hyper-correction of the sounds to a or.\n\nThe Dutch language also has many words with an -en suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While standard Dutch and most Dutch dialects do not pronounce the final n, West Flemish typically drops the e and pastes the n to the base word. For base words already ending with n, the final n sound is often prolonged to make the suffix clear. This mute-e is similar to many English words: beaten, listen, ...\n\nThe short o  in words can also be pronounced as a short u. This happens spontaneously on some words, but other words keep their original short o sounds. Similarly, the short a can turn into a short o in some words without apparent reason.\n\nThe diphthong ui does not exist in West Flemish, and is (depending on the word) pronounced as a long u or a long ie. Similar to the ui, the long o can turn into an (eu) on some words, while it becomes a in other ones.\n\nThis transition often shows similarities with English.\n\nHere are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:\n\nGrammar \n\nPlural form \n\nPlural forms in Dutch are made most often by appending an -en suffix, while West Flemish uses the -s suffix on more plural forms. This phenomenon is shared with the Lower Saxon Germanic dialects, and even more prominent in English (where a plural form on -en has become very rare). Under influence of Standard Dutch, the number of people that uses the -s suffix for the plural form on these words diverging from Dutch is diminishing. Younger speakers tend to resort more to the plural form on -en.\n\nVerb conjugation \n\nThe verbs \"zijn\" (to be) and \"hebben\" (to have) are also conjugated differently.\n\nDouble subject \n\nWest Flemish often shows a duplicated subject.\n\nArticles \n\nIn Dutch, the indefinite article does not depend on gender, while in West Flemish, it does. Though this practice is dying, and the gender-independent article more often being used. And similar to English, a connection n is only made when the next word starts with a vowel.\n\nConjugation of yes and no \n\nAnother feature of the West Flemish dialect is the conjugation of ja and nee (yes and no) to the subject of the sentence. This is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, ja and nee are generally pronounced together with the first part of the double subject. There is also an extra word: toet which is used for negating the previous sentence but giving a positive answer.\n\nJa, nee and toet can also always be made stronger by adding a mo- or ba- in front of it. Both mean \"but\" (and are derived from \"but\" or \"maar\" in Dutch), and they even can be added together (f.e. \"mobatoet\").\n\nVocabulary \n\nWest Flemish inherited many words from Saxon settlers, and later on received loanwords from wool and cloth trade with England. These two categories both differ from standard Dutch, and show similarities with English, and as such, it is difficult to differentiate between the two categories.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, the trade with French became more important, and many industrial words are French loanwords\n\nFalse friends \n\nEven when words exist in Dutch and West Flemish, their meaning is not guaranteed to be the same. This can sometimes cause confusion for native speakers who do not realise these words are used differently.",
