  "textBody" : "In probability theory and statistics, kurtosis (from , kyrtos or kurtos, meaning \"curved, arching\") is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. In a similar way to the concept of skewness, kurtosis is a descriptor of the shape of a probability distribution and, just as for skewness, there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Depending on the particular measure of kurtosis that is used, there are various interpretations of kurtosis, and of how particular measures should be interpreted.\n\nThe standard measure of kurtosis, originating with Karl Pearson, is based on a scaled version of the fourth moment of the data or population. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak; hence, the sometimes-seen characterization as \"peakedness\" is mistaken. For this measure, higher kurtosis is the result of infrequent extreme deviations (or outliers), as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations.\n\nThe kurtosis of any univariate normal distribution is 3.  It is common to compare the kurtosis of a distribution to this value.  Distributions with kurtosis less than 3 are said to be platykurtic, although this does not imply the distribution is \"flat-topped\" as sometimes reported. Rather, it means the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than does the normal distribution. An example of a platykurtic distribution is the uniform distribution, which does not produce outliers.  Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be leptokurtic.  An example of a leptokurtic distribution is the Laplace distribution, which has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a Gaussian, and therefore produces more outliers than the normal distribution. It is also common practice to use an adjusted version of Pearson's kurtosis, the excess kurtosis, which is the kurtosis minus 3, to provide the comparison to the normal distribution.  Some authors use \"kurtosis\" by itself to refer to the excess kurtosis.  For the reason of clarity and generality, however, this article follows the non-excess convention and explicitly indicates where excess kurtosis is meant.\n\nAlternative measures of kurtosis are: the L-kurtosis, which is a scaled version of the fourth L-moment; measures based on four population or sample quantiles. These are analogous to the alternative measures of skewness that are not based on ordinary moments.\n\nPearson moments \n\nThe kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment, defined as\n\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] \\operatorname{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^4\\right] \n \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^4]}{(\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^2])^2},\n\nwhere μ4 is the fourth central moment and σ is the standard deviation.\nSeveral letters are used in the literature to denote the kurtosis.  A very common choice is κ, which is fine as long as it is clear that it does not refer to a cumulant.  Other choices include γ2, to be similar to the notation for skewness, although sometimes this is instead reserved for the excess kurtosis.\n\nThe kurtosis is bounded below by the squared skewness plus 1:\n\n \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} \\geq \\left(\\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma^3}\\right)^2 + 1,\nwhere μ3 is the third central moment.\nThe lower bound is realized by the Bernoulli distribution.\nThere is no upper limit to the excess kurtosis of a general probability distribution, and it may be infinite.\n\nA reason why some authors favor the excess kurtosis is that cumulants are extensive.  Formulas related to the extensive property are more naturally expressed in terms of the excess kurtosis.  For example, let X1, ..., Xn be independent random variables for which the fourth moment exists, and let Y be the random variable defined by the sum of the Xi.  The excess kurtosis of Y is\n\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3  \\frac{1}{( \\sum_{j\n1}^n \\sigma_j^{\\,2})^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i^{\\,4} \\cdot \\left(\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3\\right),\nwhere \\sigma_i is the standard deviation of X_i.  In particular if all of the Xi have the same variance, then this simplifies to\n\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 {1 \\over n^2} \\sum_{i\n1}^n (\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3).\n\nThe reason not to subtract off 3 is that the bare fourth moment better generalizes to multivariate distributions, especially when independence is not assumed.  The cokurtosis between pairs of variables is an order four tensor.  For a bivariate normal distribution, the cokurtosis tensor has off-diagonal terms that are neither 0 nor 3 in general, so attempting to \"correct\" for an excess becomes confusing.  It is true, however, that the joint cumulants of degree greater than two for any multivariate normal distribution are zero.\n\nFor two random variables, X and Y, not necessarily independent, the kurtosis of the sum, X + Y, is\n: \n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X+Y] = {1 \\over \\sigma_{X+Y}^4} \\big( & \\sigma_X^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] + 4\\sigma_X^3\\sigma_Y\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,X,Y] \\\\\n& {} + 6\\sigma_X^2\\sigma_Y^2\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,Y,Y] \\\\[6pt]\n& {} + 4\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y^3\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,Y,Y,Y] + \\sigma_Y^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] \\big).\n\\end{align}\n\nNote that the binomial coefficients appear in the above equation.\n\nInterpretation \n\nThe exact interpretation of the Pearson measure of kurtosis (or excess kurtosis) used to be disputed, but is now settled. As Westfall (2014) notes, \"...its only unambiguous interpretation is in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution).\" The logic is simple: Kurtosis is the average (or expected value) of the standardized data raised to the fourth power. Any standardized values that are less than 1 (i.e., data within one standard deviation of the mean, where the \"peak\" would be), contribute virtually nothing to kurtosis, since raising a number that is less than 1 to the fourth power makes it closer to zero. The only data values (observed or observable) that contribute to kurtosis in any meaningful way are those outside the region of the peak; i.e., the outliers. Therefore, kurtosis measures outliers only; it measures nothing about the \"peak.\"\n\nMany incorrect interpretations of kurtosis that involve notions of peakedness have been given. One is that kurtosis measures both the \"peakedness\" of the distribution and the heaviness of its tail. Various other incorrect interpretations have been suggested, such as \"lack of shoulders\" (where the \"shoulder\" is defined vaguely as the area between the peak and the tail, or more specifically as the area about one standard deviation from the mean) or \"bimodality\". Balanda and MacGillivray assert that the standard definition of kurtosis \"is a poor measure of the kurtosis, peakedness, or tail weight of a distribution\"Balanda and MacGillivray, p. 114. and instead propose to \"define kurtosis vaguely as the location- and scale-free movement of probability mass from the shoulders of a distribution into its center and tails\".\n\nMoors' interpretation\n\nIn 1986 Moors gave an interpretation of kurtosis. Let\n  \n Z = \\frac{ X - \\mu } \\sigma,  \n \nwhere X is a random variable, μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. Then\n \n \\kappa E( Z^4 ) \n \\operatorname{var}( Z^2 ) + [ E( Z^2 ) ]^2 = \\operatorname{var}( Z^2 ) + 1, \n \nwhere κ is the kurtosis, var() is the variance and E() is the expectation operator. The kurtosis can now be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of Z2 around its expectation. Alternatively it can be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of Z around +1 and −1. κ attains its minimal value in a symmetric two-point distribution. In terms of the original variable X, the kurtosis is a measure of the dispersion of X around the two values μ ± σ.\n\nHigh values of κ arise in two circumstances:\n \n* where the probability mass is concentrated around the mean and the data-generating process produces occasional values far from the mean, \n* where the probability mass is concentrated in the tails of the distribution.\n\nExcess kurtosis \n\nThe excess kurtosis is defined as kurtosis minus 3. There are 3 distinct regimes as described below.\n\nMesokurtic \n\nDistributions with zero excess kurtosis are called mesokurtic, or mesokurtotic. The most prominent example of a mesokurtic distribution is the normal distribution family, regardless of the values of its parameters. A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the binomial distribution is mesokurtic for p = 1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{1/12}.\n\nLeptokurtic \n\nA distribution with positive excess kurtosis is called leptokurtic, or leptokurtotic. \"Lepto-\" means \"slender\".http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lepto- In terms of shape, a leptokurtic distribution has fatter tails. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the Student's t-distribution, Rayleigh distribution,  Laplace distribution, exponential distribution, Poisson distribution and the logistic distribution.  Such distributions are sometimes termed super-Gaussian.\n\nPlatykurtic \n\nA distribution with negative excess kurtosis is called platykurtic, or platykurtotic. \"Platy-\" means \"broad\".http://www.yourdictionary.com/platy-prefix In terms of shape, a platykurtic distribution has thinner tails. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the continuous or discrete uniform distributions, and the raised cosine distribution. The most platykurtic distribution of all is the Bernoulli distribution with p = ½ (for example the number of times one obtains \"heads\" when flipping a coin once, a coin toss), for which the excess kurtosis is −2. Such distributions are sometimes termed sub-Gaussian.The original paper presenting sub-Gaussians  See also \n\nGraphical examples \n\nThe Pearson type VII family \n\nThe effects of kurtosis are illustrated using a parametric family of distributions whose kurtosis can be adjusted while their lower-order moments and cumulants remain constant. Consider the Pearson type VII family, which is a special case of the Pearson type IV family restricted to symmetric densities. The probability density function is given by\n\nf(x; a, m) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m)}{a\\,\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma(m-1/2)} \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-m}, \\!\n\nwhere a is a scale parameter and m is a shape parameter.\n\nAll densities in this family are symmetric. The kth moment exists provided m > (k + 1)/2. For the kurtosis to exist, we require m > 5/2. Then the mean and skewness exist and are both identically zero. Setting a2  2m − 3 makes the variance equal to unity. Then the only free parameter is m, which controls the fourth moment (and cumulant) and hence the kurtosis.  One can reparameterize with m \n 5/2 + 3/\\gamma_2, where \\gamma_2 is the excess kurtosis as defined above. This yields a one-parameter leptokurtic family with zero mean, unit variance, zero skewness, and arbitrary non-negative excess kurtosis. The reparameterized density is\n\ng(x; \\gamma_2) f\\left(x;\\; a \n \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{6}{\\gamma_2}},\\; m = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{\\gamma_2}\\right). \\!\n\nIn the limit as \\gamma_2 \\to \\infty one obtains the density\n\ng(x) = 3\\left(2 + x^2\\right)^{-\\frac{5}{2}}, \\!\n\nwhich is shown as the red curve in the images on the right.\n\nIn the other direction as \\gamma_2 \\to 0 one obtains the standard normal density as the limiting distribution, shown as the black curve.\n\nIn the images on the right, the blue curve represents the density x \\mapsto g(x; 2) with excess kurtosis of 2.  The top image shows that leptokurtic densities in this family have a higher peak than the mesokurtic normal density, although this conclusion is only valid for this select family of distributions. The comparatively fatter tails of the leptokurtic densities are illustrated in the second image, which plots the natural logarithm of the Pearson type VII densities: the black curve is the logarithm of the standard normal density, which is a parabola. One can see that the normal density allocates little probability mass to the regions far from the mean (\"has thin tails\"), compared with the blue curve of the leptokurtic Pearson type VII density with excess kurtosis of 2.  Between the blue curve and the black are other Pearson type VII densities with γ2  1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.  The red curve again shows the upper limit of the Pearson type VII family, with \\gamma_2 \n \\infty (which, strictly speaking, means that the fourth moment does not exist). The red curve decreases the slowest as one moves outward from the origin (\"has fat tails\").\n\nOf well-known distributions \n\nSeveral well-known, unimodal and symmetric distributions from different parametric families are compared here.  Each has a mean and skewness of zero. The parameters have been chosen to result in a variance equal to 1 in each case. The images on the right show curves for the following seven densities, on a linear scale and logarithmic scale:\n\n* D: Laplace distribution, also known as the double exponential distribution, red curve (two straight lines in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 3\n* S: hyperbolic secant distribution, orange curve, excess kurtosis = 2\n* L: logistic distribution, green curve, excess kurtosis = 1.2\n* N: normal distribution, black curve (inverted parabola in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 0\n* C: raised cosine distribution, cyan curve, excess kurtosis = −0.593762...\n* W: Wigner semicircle distribution, blue curve, excess kurtosis = −1\n* U: uniform distribution, magenta curve (shown for clarity as a rectangle in both images), excess kurtosis = −1.2.\n\nNote that in these cases the platykurtic densities have bounded support, whereas the densities with positive or zero excess kurtosis are supported on the whole real line.\n\nThere exist platykurtic densities with infinite support,\n*e.g., exponential power distributions with sufficiently large shape parameter b\n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities with finite support.\n*e.g., a distribution that is uniform between −3 and −0.3, between −0.3 and 0.3, and between 0.3 and 3, with the same density in the (−3, −0.3) and (0.3, 3) intervals, but with 20 times more density in the (−0.3, 0.3) interval\n\nSample kurtosis \n\nFor a sample of n values the sample excess kurtosis is\n\n g_2 \\frac{m_4}{m_2^2} -3 \n \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^4}{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\right)^2} - 3 \n\nwhere m4 is the fourth sample moment about the mean, m2 is the second sample moment about the mean (that is, the sample variance), xi is the ith value, and \\overline{x} is the sample mean.\n\nThis formula has the simpler representation,\n\n g_2 \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\n1}^n z_i^4  - 3 \n\nwhere the  z_i  values are the standardized data values using the standard deviation defined using n rather than n − 1 in the denominator.\n\nFor example, suppose the data values are 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999.\n\nThen the   z_i  values are −0.239, −0.225, −0.221, −0.234, −0.230, −0.225, −0.239, −0.230, −0.234, −0.225, −0.230, −0.239, −0.230, −0.230, −0.225, −0.230, −0.216, −0.230, −0.225, 4.359\n\nand the  z_i^4  values are  0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 360.976.\n\nThe average of these values is 18.05 and the excess kurtosis is thus 18.05 − 3 = 15.05.  This example makes it clear that data near the \"middle\" or \"peak\" of the distribution do not contribute to the kurtosis statistic, hence kurtosis does not measure \"peakedness.\" It is simply a measure of the outlier, 999 in this example.\n\nSampling variance under normality \n\nThe variance of the sample kurtosis of a sample of size n from the normal distribution is\n\n \\frac{24n(n-1)^2}{(n-3)(n-2)(n+3)(n+5)} \n\nStated differently, under the assumption that the underlying random variable X is normally distributed, it can be shown that \\sqrt{n} g_2 \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, 24).Kendall, M.G.; Stuart, A. (1969) The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition, Griffin. \n\nUpper bound \n\nAn upper bound for the sample kurtosis of n (n > 2) real numbers is\n \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} \\le \\frac 12 \\frac {n-3}{n-2}  \\left(\\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma^3}\\right)^2 + \\frac {n}2.\n\nEstimators of population kurtosis \n\nGiven a sub-set of samples from a population, the sample excess kurtosis above is a biased estimator of the population excess kurtosis. An alternative estimator of the population excess kurtosis is defined as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\nG_2 & = \\frac{k_4}{k_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n^2\\,((n+1)\\,m_4 - 3\\,(n-1)\\,m_{2}^2)}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n^2\\,m_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left( (n+1)\\,\\frac{m_4}{m_{2}^2} - 3\\,(n-1) \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left( (n+1)\\,g_2 + 6 \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{(n+1)\\,n\\,(n-1)}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\right)^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{(n+1)\\,n}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{k_2^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2) (n-3)}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere k4 is the unique symmetric unbiased estimator of the fourth cumulant, k2 is the unbiased estimate of the second cumulant (identical to the unbiased estimate of the sample variance), m4 is the fourth sample moment about the mean, m2 is the second sample moment about the mean, xi is the ith value, and \\bar{x} is the sample mean. Unfortunately, G_2 is itself generally biased. For the normal distribution it is unbiased.\n\nApplications \n\nThe sample kurtosis is a useful measure of whether there is a problem with outliers in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious outlier problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.\n\nD'Agostino's K-squared test is a goodness-of-fit normality test based on a combination of the sample skewness and sample kurtosis, as is the Jarque–Bera test for normality.\n\nFor non-normal samples, the variance of the sample variance depends on the kurtosis; for details, please see variance.\n\nPearson's definition of kurtosis is used as an indicator of intermittency in turbulence.\n\nKurtosis convergence\n\nApplying band-pass filters to digital images, kurtosis values tend to be uniform, independent of the range of the filter. This behavior, termed kurtosis convergence, can be used to detect image splicing in forensic analysis.[http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/homepage/PUBLICATIONS_files/ICCP.pdf]\n\nOther measures \n\nA different measure of \"kurtosis\", that purports to measure the \"peakedness\" of a distribution, is provided by using L-moments instead of the ordinary moments.",

A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the binomial distribution is mesokurtic for p = 1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{1/12}.\n\nLeptokurtic \n\nA distribution with positive excess kurtosis is called leptokurtic, or leptokurtotic. \"Lepto-\" means \"slender\".http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lepto- In terms of shape, a leptokurtic distribution has fatter tails. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the Student's t-distribution, Rayleigh distribution,  Laplace distribution, exponential distribution, Poisson distribution and the logistic distribution.  Such distributions are sometimes termed super-Gaussian.\n\nPlatykurtic \n\nA distribution with negative excess kurtosis is called platykurtic, or platykurtotic. \"Platy-\" means \"broad\".http://www.yourdictionary.com/platy-prefix In terms of shape, a platykurtic distribution has thinner tails. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the continuous or discrete uniform distributions, and the raised cosine distribution. The most platykurtic distribution of all is the Bernoulli distribution with p = ½ (for example the number of times one obtains \"heads\" when flipping a coin once, a coin toss), for which the excess kurtosis is −2. Such distributions are sometimes termed sub-Gaussian.The original paper presenting sub-Gaussians  See also \n\nGraphical examples \n\nThe Pearson type VII family \n\nThe effects of kurtosis are illustrated using a parametric family of distributions whose kurtosis can be adjusted while their lower-order moments and cumulants remain constant. Consider the Pearson type VII family, which is a special case of the Pearson type IV family restricted to symmetric densities. The probability density function is given by\n\nf(x; a, m) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m)}{a\\,\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma(m-1/2)} \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-m}, \\!\n\nwhere a is a scale parameter and m is a shape parameter.\n\nAll densities in this family are symmetric. The kth moment exists provided m > (k + 1)/2. For the kurtosis to exist, we require m > 5/2. Then the mean and skewness exist and are both identically zero. Setting a2  2m − 3 makes the variance equal to unity. Then the only free parameter is m, which controls the fourth moment (and cumulant) and hence the kurtosis.  One can reparameterize with m \n 5/2 + 3/\\gamma_2, where \\gamma_2 is the excess kurtosis as defined above. This yields a one-parameter leptokurtic family with zero mean, unit variance, zero skewness, and arbitrary non-negative excess kurtosis. The reparameterized density is\n\ng(x; \\gamma_2) f\\left(x;\\; a \n \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{6}{\\gamma_2}},\\; m = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{\\gamma_2}\\right). \\!\n\nIn the limit as \\gamma_2 \\to \\infty one obtains the density\n\ng(x) = 3\\left(2 + x^2\\right)^{-\\frac{5}{2}}, \\!\n\nwhich is shown as the red curve in the images on the right.\n\nIn the other direction as \\gamma_2 \\to 0 one obtains the standard normal density as the limiting distribution, shown as the black curve.\n\nIn the images on the right, the blue curve represents the density x \\mapsto g(x; 2) with excess kurtosis of 2.  The top image shows that leptokurtic densities in this family have a higher peak than the mesokurtic normal density, although this conclusion is only valid for this select family of distributions. The comparatively fatter tails of the leptokurtic densities are illustrated in the second image, which plots the natural logarithm of the Pearson type VII densities: the black curve is the logarithm of the standard normal density, which is a parabola. One can see that the normal density allocates little probability mass to the regions far from the mean (\"has thin tails\"), compared with the blue curve of the leptokurtic Pearson type VII density with excess kurtosis of 2.  Between the blue curve and the black are other Pearson type VII densities with γ2  1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.  The red curve again shows the upper limit of the Pearson type VII family, with \\gamma_2 \n \\infty (which, strictly speaking, means that the fourth moment does not exist). The red curve decreases the slowest as one moves outward from the origin (\"has fat tails\").\n\nOf well-known distributions \n\nSeveral well-known, unimodal and symmetric distributions from different parametric families are compared here.  Each has a mean and skewness of zero. The parameters have been chosen to result in a variance equal to 1 in each case. The images on the right show curves for the following seven densities, on a linear scale and logarithmic scale:\n\n* D: Laplace distribution, also known as the double exponential distribution, red curve (two straight lines in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 3\n* S: hyperbolic secant distribution, orange curve, excess kurtosis = 2\n* L: logistic distribution, green curve, excess kurtosis = 1.2\n* N: normal distribution, black curve (inverted parabola in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 0\n* C: raised cosine distribution, cyan curve, excess kurtosis = −0.593762...\n* W: Wigner semicircle distribution, blue curve, excess kurtosis = −1\n* U: uniform distribution, magenta curve (shown for clarity as a rectangle in both images), excess kurtosis = −1.2.\n\nNote that in these cases the platykurtic densities have bounded support, whereas the densities with positive or zero excess kurtosis are supported on the whole real line.\n\nThere exist platykurtic densities with infinite support,\n*e.g., exponential power distributions with sufficiently large shape parameter b\n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities with finite support.\n*e.g., a distribution that is uniform between −3 and −0.3, between −0.3 and 0.3, and between 0.3 and 3, with the same density in the (−3, −0.3) and (0.3, 3) intervals, but with 20 times more density in the (−0.3, 0.3) interval\n\nSample kurtosis \n\nFor a sample of n values the sample excess kurtosis is\n\n g_2 \\frac{m_4}{m_2^2} -3 \n \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^4}{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\right)^2} - 3 \n\nwhere m4 is the fourth sample moment about the mean, m2 is the second sample moment about the mean (that is, the sample variance), xi is the ith value, and \\overline{x} is the sample mean.\n\nThis formula has the simpler representation,\n\n g_2 \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\n1}^n z_i^4  - 3 \n\nwhere the  z_i  values are the standardized data values using the standard deviation defined using n rather than n − 1 in the denominator.\n\nFor example, suppose the data values are 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999.\n\nThen the   z_i  values are −0.239, −0.225, −0.221, −0.234, −0.230, −0.225, −0.239, −0.230, −0.234, −0.225, −0.230, −0.239, −0.230, −0.230, −0.225, −0.230, −0.216, −0.230, −0.225, 4.359\n\nand the  z_i^4  values are  0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 360.976.\n\nThe average of these values is 18.05 and the excess kurtosis is thus 18.05 − 3 = 15.05.  This example makes it clear that data near the \"middle\" or \"peak\" of the distribution do not contribute to the kurtosis statistic, hence kurtosis does not measure \"peakedness.\" It is simply a measure of the outlier, 999 in this example.\n\nSampling variance under normality \n\nThe variance of the sample kurtosis of a sample of size n from the normal distribution is\n\n \\frac{24n(n-1)^2}{(n-3)(n-2)(n+3)(n+5)} \n\nStated differently, under the assumption that the underlying random variable X is normally distributed, it can be shown that \\sqrt{n} g_2 \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, 24).Kendall, M.G.; Stuart, A. (1969) The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition, Griffin. \n\nUpper bound \n\nAn upper bound for the sample kurtosis of n (n > 2) real numbers is\n \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} \\le \\frac 12 \\frac {n-3}{n-2}  \\left(\\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma^3}\\right)^2 + \\frac {n}2.\n\nEstimators of population kurtosis \n\nGiven a sub-set of samples from a population, the sample excess kurtosis above is a biased estimator of the population excess kurtosis. An alternative estimator of the population excess kurtosis is defined as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\nG_2 & = \\frac{k_4}{k_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n^2\\,((n+1)\\,m_4 - 3\\,(n-1)\\,m_{2}^2)}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n^2\\,m_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left( (n+1)\\,\\frac{m_4}{m_{2}^2} - 3\\,(n-1) \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left( (n+1)\\,g_2 + 6 \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{(n+1)\\,n\\,(n-1)}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\right)^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{(n+1)\\,n}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i\n1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{k_2^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2) (n-3)}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere k4 is the unique symmetric unbiased estimator of the fourth cumulant, k2 is the unbiased estimate of the second cumulant (identical to the unbiased estimate of the sample variance), m4 is the fourth sample moment about the mean, m2 is the second sample moment about the mean, xi is the ith value, and \\bar{x} is the sample mean. Unfortunately, G_2 is itself generally biased. For the normal distribution it is unbiased.\n\nApplications \n\nThe sample kurtosis is a useful measure of whether there is a problem with outliers in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious outlier problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.\n\nD'Agostino's K-squared test is a goodness-of-fit normality test based on a combination of the sample skewness and sample kurtosis, as is the Jarque–Bera test for normality.\n\nFor non-normal samples, the variance of the sample variance depends on the kurtosis; for details, please see variance.\n\nPearson's definition of kurtosis is used as an indicator of intermittency in turbulence.\n\nKurtosis convergence\n\nApplying band-pass filters to digital images, kurtosis values tend to be uniform, independent of the range of the filter. This behavior, termed kurtosis convergence, can be used to detect image splicing in forensic analysis.[http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/homepage/PUBLICATIONS_files/ICCP.pdf]\n\nOther measures \n\nA different measure of \"kurtosis\", that purports to measure the \"peakedness\" of a distribution, is provided by using L-moments instead of the ordinary moments.
