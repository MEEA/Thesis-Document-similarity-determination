  "textBody" : "In classical logic, disjunctive syllogism (historically known as modus tollendo ponens) is a valid argument form  which is a syllogism having a disjunctive statement for one of its premises.HurleyCopi and Cohen\n\nThe breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines.\nThe breach is not a safety violation.\nTherefore, it is not subject to fines.\n\nIn propositional logic, disjunctive syllogism (also known as disjunction elimination and or elimination, or abbreviated ∨E),Sanford, David Hawley. 2003. If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning. London, UK: Routledge: 39HurleyCopi and CohenMoore and Parker is a valid rule of inference. If we are told that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not the former that is true; we can infer that it has to be the latter that is true. If P is true or Q is true and P is false, then Q is true. The reason this is called \"disjunctive syllogism\" is that, first, it is a syllogism, a three-step argument, and second, it contains a logical disjunction, which simply means an  \"or\" statement.  \"P or Q\" is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's disjuncts.  The rule makes it possible to eliminate a disjunction from a logical proof. It is the rule that:\n\n\\frac{P \\or Q, \\neg P}{\\therefore Q}\n\nwhere the rule is that whenever instances of \"P \\or Q\", and \"\\neg P\" appear on lines of a proof, \"Q\" can be placed on a subsequent line.\n\nDisjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to hypothetical syllogism, in that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference. It is also related to the Law of noncontradiction and the Law of excluded middle, two of the three traditional laws of thought.\n\nFormal notation \n\nThe disjunctive syllogism rule may be written in sequent notation:\n\n P \\lor Q, \\lnot P \\vdash Q \n\nwhere \\vdash is a metalogical symbol meaning that Q is a syntactic consequence of P \\lor Q, and \\lnot P in some logical system;\n\nand expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:\n\n ((P \\or Q) \\and \\neg P) \\to Q\n\nwhere P, and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system.\n\nNatural language examples \n\nHere is an example:\nI will choose soup or I will choose salad.\nI will not choose soup.\nTherefore, I will choose salad.\n\nHere is another example:\nIt is red or it is blue.\nIt is not blue.\nTherefore, it is red.\n\nInclusive and exclusive disjunction \n\nPlease observe that the disjunctive syllogism works whether 'or' is considered 'exclusive' or 'inclusive' disjunction. See below for the definitions of these terms.\n\nThere are two kinds of logical disjunction:\n\n* inclusive means \"and/or\"  - at least one of them is true, or maybe both.\n* exclusive (\"xor\") means exactly one must be true, but they cannot both be.\n\nThe widely used English language concept of or is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments.\n\nThis argument:\nP or Q.\nNot P.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nis valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the exclusive meaning is the following form valid:\n\nEither (only) P or (only) Q.\nP.\nTherefore, not Q.\n\nHowever, if the fact is true it does not commit the fallacy.\n\nWith the inclusive meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument.
