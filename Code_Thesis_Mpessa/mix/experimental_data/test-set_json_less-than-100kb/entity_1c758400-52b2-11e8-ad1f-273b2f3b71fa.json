  "textBody" : "The International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU) is an umbrella organization founded in 1995 bringing together many Unitarian, Universalist, and Unitarian Universalist organizations. \nThe size of the affiliated organizations varies widely. Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the Unitarian Universalist Association, has over 160,000 members  and is larger than all the other groups put together.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (British Unitarians) in 1987. This led to the establishment of the Advocates for the Establishment of an International Organization of Unitarians (AEIOU), which worked towards creating the council. However, the General Assembly resolution provided no funding.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) became particularly interested in the establishment of a council when it had to deal with an increasing number of applications for membership from congregations outside North America. It had already granted membership to congregations in Adelaide, Auckland, the Philippines and Pakistan, and congregations in Sydney, Russia and Spain had applied for membership. Rather than admit congregations from all over the world, the UUA hoped that they would join a world council instead. The UUA thus became willing to provide funding for the council's establishment.\n\nAs a result, the council was finally established at a meeting in Essex, Massachusetts, United States on 23–26 March 1995.\n\nPrinciples and purposes\n\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists reads:\n\nWe, the member groups of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists, affirming our belief in religious community based on:\n\n*liberty of conscience and individual thought in matters of faith,\n*the inherent worth and dignity of every person.\n*justice and compassion in human relations,\n*responsible stewardship in human relations,\n*and our commitment to democratic principles,\n\ndeclare our purposes to be:\n*to serve the Infinite Spirit of Life and the human community by strengthening the worldwide Unitarian and Universalist faith,\n*to affirm the variety and richness of our living traditions,\n*to facilitate mutual support among member organizations,\n*to promote our ideals and principles around the world,\n*to provide models of liberal religious response to the human condition which upholds our common values.\n\nMembers\n\nFull members\n\n*Australian and New Zealand Unitarian Universalist Association (ANZUUA), 500 members\n*Brazilian Unitarian Association\n*Burundi Unitarian Church\n*Canadian Unitarian Council, 5,150\n*Czech Republic: Náboženská společnost českých unitářů (Religious Society of Czech Unitarians)\n*Denmark: Unitarisk Kirkesamfund, 55 families\n*European Unitarian Universalists, 120 members across Europe\n*Finland: Unitarian Universalist Society of Finland, 22 members\n*Germany: Unitarier - Religionsgemeinschaft freien Glaubens\n*Hungary: Unitarian Church of Hungary, 25,000 members\n*India: The Indian Council of Unitarian Churches, which includes the Khasi Unitarian Union, 9,000 members, and the Unitarian Christian Church of Madras, 225 members\n*Indonesia Global Church of God, around 200 members\n*Netherlands: Vrijzinnige Geloofsgemeenschap NPB, 4,385 members (2011), 60 congregations\n*Nigeria: First Unitarian Church of Nigeria and Ijo Isokan Gbogbo Eda (Unitarian Brotherhood Church)\n*Norwegian Unitarian Church\n*Philippines: Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines founded 1954, 2000 members\n*Romania: Unitarian Church of Transylvania, 80,000 members\n*South Africa: Unitarian Church of South Africa, 110 members\n*Spain: Unitarian Universalist Society of Spain, 55 members\n*UK: General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, 6,000 members\n*USA: Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), 162,796 (adult members)\n\nReorganizing\n\n*Kosciol Unitarianski (Unitarian Church in Poland), 80 attendees and friends.\n\nPolish Unitarians have reported a need for a period of reorganization, and that at this time they are unable to maintain the level of activity needed to be full Council members, be it moved that membership of these groups be suspended. This action is taken with regret and the ICUU looks forward to welcoming Poland back into membership at the earliest possible date.\n\nProvisional members\n\nChurches and religious associations which have expressed their will to become members of the Council may be admitted as \"Provisional Members\" for a period of time (generally two or four years), until the Council decides that they have shown their organizational stability, affinity with the ICUU principles and commitment to deserve becoming Full Members of the Council. Provisional Members are invited to Council meetings through a delegate but cannot vote.\n\n*Kenyan Unitarians\n\nEmerging groups\n\nAccording to the [http://icuu.net/about/Bylaws.html Bylaws of the ICUU], Emerging Groups are \"applicants that are deemed to be reasonable prospects for membership, but do not fulfil the conditions of either Provisional membership or Full Membership\". These groups may be designated as Emerging Groups by the Executive Committee upon its sole discretion. Emerging Groups may be invited as observers to General Meetings.\n\nThe current list of Emerging Groups after the last meeting of the Executive Committee (London, 22–25 November 2008) is as follows:\n*Congo Unitarians\n*French Unitarians ([http://afcu.over-blog.org Assemblée Fraternelle des Chrétiens Unitariens])\n*[http://uuhk.org Unitarian Universalists Hong Kong]—Hong Kong (China)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050411045142/http://italianunitarian.christian.net/index.html Italian Unitarians]\n*Mexico (two groups: the [http://www.lcum.blogspot.com/ Free Unitarian Congregation of Mexico, (LCUM)] and the Unitarian Universalists of Mexico AC)\n\nAssociates\n\nOrganizations with beliefs and purposes closely akin to those of ICUU but which by nature of their constitution are not eligible for full membership or which do not wish to become full members now or in the foreseeable future, may become Associates of the ICUU.
