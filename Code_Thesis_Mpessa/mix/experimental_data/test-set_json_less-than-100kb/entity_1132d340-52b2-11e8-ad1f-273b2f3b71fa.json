  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a hyperbola (plural hyperbolas or hyperbolae) is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows.  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.  (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function f(x) = 1/x in the Cartesian plane,\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a sundial,\n* as the shape of an open orbit (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a spacecraft during a gravity assisted swing-by of a planet or more generally any spacecraft exceeding the escape velocity of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition comet (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the scattering trajectory of a subatomic particle (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in radio navigation, when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the asymptote of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve f(x) = 1/x the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes.\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids (\"wastebaskets\"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).\n\nEtymology and history\n\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the Greek , meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones.. The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–c. 190 BC) in his definitive work on the conic sections, the Conics. \nThe names of the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for \"deficient\" and \"applied\"; all three names are borrowed from earlier Pythagorean terminology which referred to a comparison of the side of rectangles of fixed area with a given line segment. The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.\n\nDefinition of a hyperbola as locus of points \n\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n* A hyperbola is a set of points, such that for any point P of the set, the absolute difference of the distances |PF_1|,\\ |PF_2| to two fixed points F_1,F_2 (the foci), is  constant, usually denoted by 2a, \\ a>0\\ :\n\nH \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || \n 2a \\}\\ .\n\nThe midpoint M of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the major axis. It contains the vertices V_1,V_2, which have distance  a to the center. The distance c of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity. The quotient \\tfrac c a is the eccentricity e.\n\nThe equation ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):\nIf c_2 is the circle with midpoint F_2 and radius 2a, then the distance of a point P of the right branch to the circle c_2 equals the distance to the focus F_1:\n:|PF_1|=|Pc_2|.\nc_2 is called  the circular directrix (related to focus F_2) of the hyperbola.The German term for this circle is Leitkreis which can be translated as \"Director circle\", but that term has a different meaning in the English literature (see Director circle). In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to F_1. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.\n\nHyperbola in Cartesian coordinates \n\nEquation \n\nIf Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the x-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called east-west-opening and \nthe foci are the points F_1(c,0),\\ F_2\n(-c,0), \nthe vertices are V_1(a, 0),\\ V_2\n(-a,0).\nFor an arbitrary point (x,y) the distance to the focus (c,0) is \n\\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2 } and to the second focus \\sqrt{ (x+c)^2 + y^2 }. Hence the point (x,y) is on the hyperbola if the following condition is fulfilled \n\\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2} - \\sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} = \\pm 2a \\ .\nRemove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation b^2 = c^2-a^2 to obtain the equation of the hyperbola:\n\n*\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ .\n\nThis equation is called the canonical form of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is congruent to the original (see below).\n\nThe axes of symmetry or principal axes are the transverse axis (the segment of length 2a with endpoints at the vertices) and the conjugate axis (the segment of length 2b perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola’s center). As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: (a,0),\\; (-a,0). The two points (0,b),\\; (0,-b) on the conjugate axis are not on the hyperbola.\n\nIt follows from the equation that the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nEccentricity\n\nFor a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the eccentricity is given by\n\ne=\\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}.\n\nTwo hyperbolas are geometrically similar to each other – meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – if and only if they have the same eccentricity.\n\nAsymptotes \n\nSolving the equation (above) of the hyperbola for y yields\ny=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}\\sqrt{x^2-a^2}.\nIt follows from this that the hyperbola approaches the two lines  \n*y=\\pm \\frac{b}{a}x \nfor large values of |x|. These two lines intersect at the center (origin) and are called asymptotes of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ .\n\nWith help of the figure one can see that\n{\\color{blue}{(1)}} The distance from a focus to either asymptote is b (the semi-minor axis).\n\nFrom the Hesse normal form \\tfrac{bx\\pm ay}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}0  of the asymptotes and the equation of the hyperbola one gets:Mitchell, Douglas W., \"A property of hyperbolas and their asymptotes\", Mathematical Gazette 96, July 2012, 299–301.\n{\\color{magenta}{(2)}} The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to both the asymptotes is the constant \\tfrac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}\\ ,  which can also be written in terms of the eccentricity e as \\left( \\tfrac{b}{e}\\right) ^2.\n\nFrom the equation y=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}\\sqrt{x^2-a^2} of the hyperbola (above) one can derive:\n{\\color{green}{(3)}} The product of the slopes of lines from a point P to the two vertices is the constant b^2/a^2\\ .\n\nIn addition, from (2) above it can be shown that\n{\\color{red}{(4)}} The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to the asymptotes along lines parallel to the asymptotes is the constant \\tfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}.\n\nSemi-latus rectum \n\nThe length of the chord through one of the foci, perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola, is called the latus rectum. One half of it is the semi-latus rectum p. A calculation shows\n*p = \\frac{b^2}a.\nThe semi-latus rectum p may also be viewed as the radius of curvature  of the osculating circles at the vertices.\n\nTangent \n\nThe simplest way to determine the equation of the tangent at a point (x_0,y_0) is to implicitly differentiate the equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 of the hyperbola. Denoting dy/dx as y′, this produces\n\\frac{2x}{a^2}-\\frac{2yy'}{b^2}0 \\ \\rightarrow \\ y'\n\\frac{x}{y}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\ \\rightarrow \\ y=\\frac{x_0}{y_0}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}(x-x_0) +y_0.\nWith respect to \\tfrac{x_0^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y_0^2}{b^2}= 1, the equation of the tangent at point (x_0,y_0) is,\n*\\frac{x_0}{a^2}x-\\frac{y_0}{b^2}y = 1.\n\nA particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections.J. W. Downs, Practical Conic Sections, Dover Publ., 2003 (orig. 1993): p. 26. Let f be the distance from the vertex V (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2f. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.\n\nRectangular hyperbola \n\nIn the case a b the hyperbola is called rectangular (or equilateral), because its asymptotes intersect rectangularly (i.e., are perpendicular). For this case, the linear eccentricity is c\n\\sqrt{2}a, the eccentricity e\\sqrt{2} and the semi-latus rectum p\na.\n\nParametric representation with hyperbolic sine/cosine \n\nUsing the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions \\cosh,\\sinh, a parametric representation of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 can be obtained, which is similar to the parametric representation of an ellipse:\n*(\\pm a \\cosh t, b \\sinh t),\\, t \\in \\R \\ ,\nwhich satisfies the Cartesian equation because \\cosh^2 t -\\sinh^2 t =1 .\n\nFurther parametric representations are given in the section Parametric equations below.\n\nConjugate hyperbola \n\nExchange x and y to obtain the equation of the conjugate hyperbola (see diagram):\n*\\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\\frac{x^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ , also written as \n\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= -1 \\ .\n\nHyperbola with equation y\nA/x \n\nIf the xy-coordinate system is rotated about the origin by the angle -45^\\circ  and new coordinates \\xi,\\eta are assigned, then x\\tfrac{\\xi+\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}},\\; y\n\\tfrac{-\\xi+\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}} . \nThe rectangular hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}1 (whose semi-axes are equal) has the new equation \\tfrac{2\\xi\\eta}{a^2}\n1.\nSolving for \\eta yields \\eta=\\tfrac{a^2/2}{\\xi} \\ . \n\nThus, in an xy-coordinate system the graph of a function f: x\\mapsto \\tfrac{A}{x},\\; A>0\\; ,  with equation\n*y=\\frac{A}{x}\\;, A>0\\; , is a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the first and third quadrants with\n*the coordinate axes as asymptotes,\n*the line y=x as major axis ,\n*the center (0,0) and the semi-axis  ab\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the vertices (\\sqrt{A},\\sqrt{A}), (-\\sqrt{A},-\\sqrt{A}) \\; ,\n*the semi-latus rectum and radius of curvature  at the vertices  pa\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the linear eccentricity c2\\sqrt{A} and the eccentricity e\n\\sqrt{2} \\; ,\n*the tangent y=-\\tfrac{A}{x_0^2}x+2\\tfrac{A}{x_0} at point (x_0,A/x_0)\\; .\n\nA rotation of the original hyperbola by +45^\\circ results in a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the second and fourth quadrants, with the same asymptotes, center, semi-latus rectum, radius of curvature at the vertices, linear eccentricity, and eccentricity as for the case of -45^\\circ rotation, with equation \n*y=\\frac{-A}{x} \\; , A>0\\; ,  \n*the semi-axes  ab\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the line  y=-x as major axis, \n*the vertices (-\\sqrt{A},\\sqrt{A}), (\\sqrt{A},-\\sqrt{A}) \\; .\n\nShifting the hyperbola with equation y=\\frac{A}{x}, \\ A\\ne 0\\ , so that the new center is (c_0,d_0), yields the new equation \n*y=\\frac{A}{x-c_0}+d_0\\; ,\nand the new asymptotes are xc_0  and y\nd_0. \nThe shape parameters a,b,p,c,e remain unchanged.\n\nDefinition of a hyperbola by the directrix property \n\nThe two lines at distance d = \\frac{a^2}c and parallel to the minor axis are called directrices of the hyperbola (see diagram). \n* For an arbitrary point P of the hyperbola the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity:\n:\\frac \\frac \n e= \\frac{c}{a}\\ .\nThe proof for the pair F_1, l_1 follows from the fact that |PF_1|^2(x-c)^2+y^2,\\ |Pl_1|^2\n(x-\\tfrac{a^2}{c})^2 and y^2=\\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}x^2-b^2 satisfy the equation\n|PF_1|^2-\\frac{c^2}{a^2}|Pl_1|^2=0\\ .\nThe second case is proven analogously.\n\nThe inverse statement is also true and can be used to define a hyperbola (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):\n* For any point F (focus), any line l (directrix) not through F and any real number e with e > 1 the set of points (locus of points), for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is e\n:H \\{P \\mid  \\frac \n e\\} \nis a hyperbola.\n\n(The choice e = 1 yields a parabola and if e  an ellipse.)\n\n;Proof:\nLet F=(f,0) ,\\ e >0 and assume (0,0) is a point on the curve. \nThe directrix l has equation x-\\tfrac{f}{e}. With P\n(x,y), the relation |PF|^2=e^2|Pl|^2 produces the equations\n(x-f)^2+y^2e^2(x+\\tfrac{f}{e})^2\n(e x+f)^2 and x^2(e^2-1)+2xf(1+e)-y^2=0.\nThe substitution p=f(1+e) yields\n* x^2(e^2-1)+2px-y^2=0.\nThis is the equation of an ellipse (e) or a parabola  (e=1) or a hyperbola (e>1). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).\n\nIf e>1, introduce new parameters a,b so that\ne^2-1 \\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}, \\text { and }\\ p\n\\tfrac{b^2}{a}, and then the equation above becomes \n\\tfrac{(x+a)^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1\\ ,\nwhich is the equation of a hyperbola with center (-a,0), the x-axis as major axis and\nthe major/minor semi axis a,b.\n\nHyperbola as plane section of a cone  \n\nThe intersection of an upright double cone by a plane not through the vertex with slope greater than the slope of the lines on the cone is a hyperbola (see diagram: red curve). In order to prove the defining property of a hyperbola (see above) one uses two Dandelin spheres d_1, d_2, which are spheres that touch the cone along circles c_1 , c_2  and the intersecting (hyperbola) plane at points F_1 and F_2. It turns out: F_1, F_2 are the foci of the hyperbola.\n# Let  P be an arbitrary point of the intersection curve .\n# The generator (line) of the cone containing P intersects circle c_1 at point A and circle c_2 at a point B.\n# The line segments \\overline{PF_1} and \\overline{PA} are tangential to the sphere d_1 and, hence, are of equal length.\n# The line segments \\overline{PF_2} and \\overline{PB} are tangential to the sphere d_2 and, hence, are of equal length.\n# The result is: |PF_1|-|PF_2||PA|-|PB|\n|AB| is independent of the hyperbola point P.\n\nThe tangent bisects the angle between the lines to the foci \n\nFor a hyperbola the following statement is true:\n* The tangent at a point P bisects the angle between the lines \\overline{PF_1}, \\overline{PF_2}.\n;Proof:\nLet L be the point on the line \\overline{PF_2} with the distance 2a to the focus F_2 (see diagram, a is the semi major axis of the hyperbola). Line w is the bisector of the angle between the lines \\overline{PF_1}, \\overline{PF_2}. In order to prove that w is the tangent line at point P, one checks that any point Q on line w which is different from P cannot be on the hyperbola. Hence w has  only point P in common with the hyperbola and is, therefore, the tangent at point P. \nFrom the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that |QF_2| holds, which means: |QF_2|-|QF_1|. But if Q is a point of the hyperbola, the difference should be 2a.\n\nMidpoints of parallel chords \n\n* The midpoints of parallel chords of a hyperbola lie on a line through the center (see diagram).\nThe points of any chord may lie on different branches of the hyperbola.\n\nThe proof of the property on midpoints is best done for the hyperbola y1/x. Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola y\n1/x (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:\nFor two points P(x_1,\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}), \\ Q\n(x_2,\\tfrac {1 }{x_2}) of the hyperbola y=1/x  \n* the midpoint of the chord is M(\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\cdots)\n\\cdots =\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}\\; (1,\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2}) \\ ;\n* the slope of the chord is \\frac{\\tfrac {1 }{x_2}-\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}}{x_2-x_1}\\cdots \n-\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\ .\nFor parallel chords the slope is constant and the midpoints of the parallel chords lie on the line y=\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\; x \\ .\n\nConsequence: for any pair of points P,Q of a chord there exists a skew reflection with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points P,Q and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line m, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to m.\n\nBecause a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint M of a chord P Q divides the related line segment \\overline P \\, \\overline Q between the asymptotes  into halves, too. This means that |P\\overline P|=|Q\\overline Q|. This property can be used for the construction of further points Q of the hyperbola if a point P and the asymptotes are given.\n\nIf the chord degenerates into a tangent, then the touching point divides the line segment between the asymptotes in two halves.\n\nSteiner generation of a hyperbola \n\nThe following method to construct single points of a hyperbola relies on the Steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section: \n*Given two pencils B(U),B(V) of lines at two points U,V (all lines containing U and  V, respectively) and a projective but not perspective mapping \\pi of B(U) onto B(V), then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non-degenerate projective conic section.\n\nFor the generation of points of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}1 one uses the pencils at the vertices V_1,V_2. Let P\n(x_0,y_0) be a point of the hyperbola and A(a,y_0), B\n(x_0,0). The line segment  \\overline{BP} is divided into n equally-spaced segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal AB as direction onto the line segment \\overline{AP} (see diagram). The parallel projection is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at V_1 and V_2 needed. The intersection points of any two related lines   S_1A_i and S_2B_i are points of the uniquely defined hyperbola.\n\nRemark: The subdivision could be extended beyond the points A and B in order to get more points, but the determination of the intersection points would become more inaccurate. A better idea is extending the points already constructed by symmetry (see animation).\n\nRemark:\n# The Steiner generation exists for ellipses and parabolas, too. \n# The Steiner generation is sometimes called a parallelogram method because one can use other points rather than the vertices, which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle.\n\nInscribed angles for hyperbolas y\na/(x−b)+c and the 3-point-form \n\nA hyperbola with equation y=\\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c,\\ a \\ne 0  is uniquely determined by three points (x_1,y_1),\\;(x_2,y_2),\\; (x_3,y_3) with different x- and y-coordinates. A simple way to determine the shape parameters a,b,c uses the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas:\n\n*In order to measure an angle between two lines with equations ym_1x+d_1, \\ y\nm_2x + d_2\\ ,m_1,m_2 \\ne 0  in this context one uses the quotient\n:\\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\ .\n\nAnalogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles one gets the\n\nInscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas:,:[http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~ehartmann/circlegeom.pdf E. Hartmann: Lecture Note 'Planar Circle Geometries', an Introduction to Möbius-, Laguerre- and Minkowski Planes, p. 93]W.

That means if\n:\\frac{(y_4-y_1)}{(x_4-x_1)}\\frac{(x_4-x_2)}{(y_4-y_2)}=\\frac{(y_3-y_1)}{(x_3-x_1)}\\frac{(x_3-x_2)}{(y_3-y_2)}\n\n(Proof: straightforward calculation. If the points are on a hyperbola, one can assume the hyperbola's equation is y=a/x.)\n\nA consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas is the\n\n3-point-form of a hyperbola's equation:\nThe equation of the hyperbola determined by 3 points P_i(x_i,y_i),\\ i\n1,2,3,\\ x_i\\ne x_k, y_i\\ne y_k, i\\ne k is the solution of the equation \n:\\frac{({\\color{red}y}-y_1)}{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_2)}{({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}=\\frac{(y_3-y_1)}{(x_3-x_1)}\\frac{(x_3-x_2)}{(y_3-y_2)}\nfor {\\color{red}y}.\n\nOrthogonal tangents - orthoptic\n\nFor a hyperbola \\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}1, \\, a>b the intersection points of orthogonal tangents lie on the circle x^2+y^2\na^2-b^2. \nThis circle is called the orthoptic of the given hyperbola.\n\nThe tangents may belong to points on different branches of the hyperbola.\n\nIn case of a\\le b there are no pairs of orthogonal tangents.\n\nPole-polar relation for a hyperbola \n\nAny hyperbola can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}1. The equation of the tangent at a point P_0\n(x_0,y_0) of the hyperbola  is \\tfrac{x_0x}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y_0y}{b^2}1. If one allows  point P_0\n(x_0,y_0) to be an arbitrary point different from the origin, then \n* point P_0(x_0,y_0)\\ne(0,0) is mapped onto the line \\frac{x_0x}{a^2}-\\frac{y_0y}{b^2}\n1 , not through the center of the hyperbola. \nThis relation between points and lines is a bijection.\n\nThe inverse function maps\n* line y=mx+d,\\ d\\ne 0 onto the point \\left(-\\frac{ma^2}{d},-\\frac{b^2}{d}\\right) and\nline x=c,\\ c\\ne 0 onto the point \\left(\\frac{a^2}{c},0\\right)\\ .\n\nSuch a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or just polarity. The pole is the point, the polar the line. See Pole and polar.\n\nBy calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the hyperbola:\n* For a point (pole) on the hyperbola the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram: P_1,\\ p_1).\n* For a pole P outside the hyperbola the intersection points of its polar with the hyperbola are the tangency points of the two tangents passing P (see diagram: P_2,\\ p_2,\\ P_3,\\ p_3).\n* For a point within the hyperbola the polar has no point with the hyperbola in common.  (see diagram: P_4,\\ p_4).\n\nRemarks:\n# The intersection point of two polars (for example: p_2,p_3) is the pole of the line through their poles (here: P_2,P_3).\n# The foci (c,0), and  (-c,0) respectively and the directrices x\\tfrac{a^2}{c} and x\n-\\tfrac{a^2}{c} respectively belong to pairs of  pole and polar.\nPole-polar relations exist for ellipses and parabolas, too.\n\nHyperbola as an affine image of the unit hyperbola x²-y²\n1 \n\nAnother definition of a hyperbola uses affine transformations:\n*Any hyperbola is the affine image of the unit hyperbola with equation x^2-y^2=1.\n\nAn affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form \\vec x \\to \\vec f_0+A\\vec x, where A is a regular matrix (its determinant is not 0) and \\vec f_0 is an arbitrary vector.

The area of a rhombus is equal to one half of the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are the semi-axes a,b of the hyperbola. Hence:\n*The area of the triangle MCD is independent of the point of the hyperbola: A=ab.\n\nPolar coordinates \n\npole = focus: \n\nThe polar coordinates used most commonly for the hyperbola are defined relative to the Cartesian coordinate system that has its origin in a focus and its x-axis pointing towards the origin of the \"canonical coordinate system\" as illustrated in the first diagram.\nIn this case the angle \\varphi is called true anomaly.\n\nRelative to this coordinate system one has that\n*r \\frac{p}{1 \\mp e \\cos \\varphi}, \\quad p\n\\tfrac{b^2}{a}\nand\n-\\arccos \\left(-\\frac 1 e\\right) \n\npole = center:\n\nWith polar coordinates relative to the \"canonical coordinate system\" (see second diagram)\none has that\n*r =\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{e^2 \\cos^2 \\varphi -1}} .\\,\nFor the right branch of the hyperbola the range of  \\varphi  is\n-\\arccos \\left(\\frac 1 e\\right) \n\nParametric equations \n\nA hyperbola with equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1  can be described by several parametric equations:\n1: \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\\quad \\; x \\, \\, \\pm a \\cosh t \\\\ y \\, \n \\, b \\sinh t \\end{matrix}\\right. \\quad ,\\ t \\in \\R \\ .\n2: \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} \\quad \\ x \\, \\, \\pm a\\, \\tfrac{t^2+1}{2t} \\\\ y \\, \n \\, b\\, \\tfrac{t^2-1}{2t} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\quad ,\\ t >0 \\ .

One gets\n\\vec c_\\pm(m) = \\left(-\\frac{ma^2}{\\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\\;,\\;\\frac{-b^2}{\\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\\right) \\ , \\ |m|>b/a \\ .\n\\vec c_- is the upper and \\vec c_+ the lower half of the hyperbola. The points with vertical tangents (vertices  (\\pm a,0)) are not covered by the representation.\nThe equation of the tangent at point \\vec c_\\pm(m) is\ny = m x \\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}.\nThis description of the tangents of a hyperbola is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of a hyperbola.\n\nOther mathematical definitions\n\nReciprocation of a circle\n\nThe reciprocation of a circle B in a circle C always yields a conic section such as a hyperbola. The process of \"reciprocation in a circle C\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding pole and polar, respectively. The pole of a line is the inversion of its closest point to the circle C, whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to C is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius r of reciprocation circle C. If B and C represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center B must lie outside of the reciprocating circle C.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle B, as well as the envelope of the polar lines of the points on B. Conversely, the circle B is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to B have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle C; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on B are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle B that are separated by these tangent points.\n\nQuadratic equation\n\nA hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) in the plane,\n\nA_{xx} x^2 + 2 A_{xy} xy + A_{yy} y^2 + 2 B_x x + 2 B_y y + C = 0,\n\nprovided that the constants Axx, Axy, Ayy, Bx, By, and C satisfy the determinant condition\n\nD := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix} \n\nThis determinant is conventionally called the discriminant of the conic section., [https://books.google.com/books?id75mAJPcAWT8C&pg\nPA45 Section 3.2, page 45]\n\nA special case of a hyperbola—the degenerate hyperbola consisting of two intersecting lines—occurs when another determinant is zero:\n\n\\Delta :\\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\\\ B_x & B_y & C \\end{vmatrix} \n 0.\n\nThis determinant Δ is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.Korn, Granino A. and Korn, Theresa M.  Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers: Definitions, Theorems, and Formulas for Reference and Review, Dover Publ., second edition, 2000: p. 40.\n\nGiven the above general parametrization of the hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates, the eccentricity can be found using the formula in Conic section#Eccentricity in terms of parameters of the quadratic form.\n\nThe center (xc, yc) of the hyperbola may be determined from the formulae\n\nx_c = -\\frac{1}{D} \\begin{vmatrix} B_x & A_{xy} \\\\ B_y & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix};\n\ny_c = -\\frac 1 D \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & B_y \\end{vmatrix}.\n\nIn terms of new coordinates,  and , the defining equation of the hyperbola can be written\n\nA_{xx} \\xi^2 + 2A_{xy} \\xi\\eta + A_{yy} \\eta^2 + \\frac \\Delta D = 0.\n\nThe principal axes of the hyperbola make an angle φ with the positive x-axis that is given by\n\n\\tan 2\\varphi = \\frac{2A_{xy}}{A_{xx} - A_{yy}}.\n\nRotating the coordinate axes so that the x-axis is aligned with the transverse axis brings the equation into its canonical form\n\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.\n\nThe major and minor semiaxes a and b are defined by the equations\n\na^2 -\\frac \\Delta {\\lambda_1 D} \n -\\frac \\Delta {\\lambda_1^2 \\lambda_2},\n\nb^{2} -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\lambda_{2}D} \n -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}^{2}},\n\nwhere λ1 and λ2 are the roots of the quadratic equation\n\n\\lambda^2 - \\left( A_{xx} + A_{yy} \\right)\\lambda + D = 0.\n\nFor comparison, the corresponding equation for a degenerate hyperbola (consisting of two intersecting lines) is\n\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0.\n\nThe tangent line to a given point (x0, y0) on the hyperbola is defined by the equation\n\nE x + F y + G = 0\n\nwhere E, F and G are defined by\n\nE = A_{xx} x_0 + A_{xy} y_0 + B_x,\n\nF = A_{xy} x_0 + A_{yy} y_0 + B_y,\n\nG = B_x x_0 + B_y y_0 + C.\n\nThe normal line to the hyperbola at the same point is given by the equation\n\nF(x - x_0) - E(y - y_0) = 0.\n\nThe normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, and both pass through the same point (x0, y0).\n\nFrom the equation\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \\qquad 0 \nthe left focus is (-ae,0) and the right focus is (ae,0),  where  is the eccentricity.

The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a central projection onto an image plane, i.e., all projection rays pass a fixed point O, the center. The lens plane is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens O.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \na) a circle, if circle c is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\nb) an ellipse, if c has no point with the lens plane in common,\nc) a parabola, if c has one point with the lens plane in common and\nd) a hyperbola, if c has two points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point O are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point O generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\nDerived curves\n\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by inversion, the so-called inverse curves of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.\n\nElliptic coordinates \n\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of elliptic coordinates in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance c from the origin on the x-axis, and where θ is the angle of the asymptotes with the x-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a conformal map of the Cartesian coordinate system w z + 1/z, where z\n x + iy are the original Cartesian coordinates, and w=u + iv are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping w = z2 transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\nOther properties of hyperbolas\n\n*The following are concurrent: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.[http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html][http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm]\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.\n\nHyperbolic functions\n\nJust as the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the unit hyperbola, as shown in this diagram.\n\nApplications\n\nSundials\n\nHyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\nMultilateration\n\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2a from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2a whose foci are the two given points.\n\nPath followed by a particle\n\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy E of the particle is greater than zero (i.e., if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated the existence of an atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse square law requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\nKorteweg–de Vries equation\n\nThe hyperbolic trig function \\operatorname{sech}\\, x appears as one solution to the Korteweg–de Vries equation which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\nAngle trisection\n\nAs shown first by Apollonius of Perga, a hyperbola can be used to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex O, which intersects the sides of the angle at points A and B. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  A and B and its perpendicular bisector \\ell. Construct a hyperbola of eccentricity e=2 with \\ell as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment OP about the line \\ell obtaining the point P' as the image of P. Segment AP' has the same length as segment BP due to the reflection, while segment PP' has the same length as segment BP due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As OA, OP', OP and OB are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles OAP', OPP' and OPB are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3×POB = AOB.This construction is due to Pappus of Alexandria (circa 300 A.D.) and the proof comes from .\n\nEfficient portfolio frontier\n\nIn portfolio theory, the locus of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.\n\nHyperbolas as plane sections of quadrics \n\nHyperbolas appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:\n* Elliptic cone \n* Hyperbolic cylinder\n* Hyperbolic paraboloid\n* Hyperboloid of one sheet\n* Hyperboloid of two sheets\n\nQuadric Cone.jpg|Elliptic cone\nHyperbolic Cylinder Quadric.png|Hyperbolic cylinder\nHyperbol Paraboloid.pov.png|Hyperbolic paraboloid\nHyperboloid1.png|Hyperboloid of one sheet\nHyperboloid2.png|Hyperboloid of two sheets",

    "aggregatedText" : "In mathematics, a hyperbola (plural hyperbolas or hyperbolae) is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows.  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.  (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function f(x) = 1/x in the Cartesian plane,\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a sundial,\n* as the shape of an open orbit (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a spacecraft during a gravity assisted swing-by of a planet or more generally any spacecraft exceeding the escape velocity of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition comet (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the scattering trajectory of a subatomic particle (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in radio navigation, when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the asymptote of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve f(x) = 1/x the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes.\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids (\"wastebaskets\"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).\n\nEtymology and history\n\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the Greek , meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones.. The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–c. 190 BC) in his definitive work on the conic sections, the Conics. \nThe names of the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for \"deficient\" and \"applied\"; all three names are borrowed from earlier Pythagorean terminology which referred to a comparison of the side of rectangles of fixed area with a given line segment. The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.\n\nDefinition of a hyperbola as locus of points \n\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n* A hyperbola is a set of points, such that for any point P of the set, the absolute difference of the distances |PF_1|,\\ |PF_2| to two fixed points F_1,F_2 (the foci), is  constant, usually denoted by 2a, \\ a>0\\ :\n\nH \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || \n 2a \\}\\ .\n\nThe midpoint M of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the major axis. It contains the vertices V_1,V_2, which have distance  a to the center. The distance c of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity. The quotient \\tfrac c a is the eccentricity e.\n\nThe equation ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):\nIf c_2 is the circle with midpoint F_2 and radius 2a, then the distance of a point P of the right branch to the circle c_2 equals the distance to the focus F_1:\n:|PF_1|=|Pc_2|.\nc_2 is called  the circular directrix (related to focus F_2) of the hyperbola.The German term for this circle is Leitkreis which can be translated as \"Director circle\", but that term has a different meaning in the English literature (see Director circle). In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to F_1. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.\n\nHyperbola in Cartesian coordinates \n\nEquation \n\nIf Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the x-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called east-west-opening and \nthe foci are the points F_1(c,0),\\ F_2\n(-c,0), \nthe vertices are V_1(a, 0),\\ V_2\n(-a,0).\nFor an arbitrary point (x,y) the distance to the focus (c,0) is \n\\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2 } and to the second focus \\sqrt{ (x+c)^2 + y^2 }. Hence the point (x,y) is on the hyperbola if the following condition is fulfilled \n\\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2} - \\sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} = \\pm 2a \\ .\nRemove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation b^2 = c^2-a^2 to obtain the equation of the hyperbola:\n\n*\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ .\n\nThis equation is called the canonical form of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is congruent to the original (see below).\n\nThe axes of symmetry or principal axes are the transverse axis (the segment of length 2a with endpoints at the vertices) and the conjugate axis (the segment of length 2b perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola’s center). As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: (a,0),\\; (-a,0). The two points (0,b),\\; (0,-b) on the conjugate axis are not on the hyperbola.\n\nIt follows from the equation that the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nEccentricity\n\nFor a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the eccentricity is given by\n\ne=\\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}.\n\nTwo hyperbolas are geometrically similar to each other – meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – if and only if they have the same eccentricity.\n\nAsymptotes \n\nSolving the equation (above) of the hyperbola for y yields\ny=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}\\sqrt{x^2-a^2}.\nIt follows from this that the hyperbola approaches the two lines  \n*y=\\pm \\frac{b}{a}x \nfor large values of |x|. These two lines intersect at the center (origin) and are called asymptotes of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ .\n\nWith help of the figure one can see that\n{\\color{blue}{(1)}} The distance from a focus to either asymptote is b (the semi-minor axis).\n\nFrom the Hesse normal form \\tfrac{bx\\pm ay}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}0  of the asymptotes and the equation of the hyperbola one gets:Mitchell, Douglas W., \"A property of hyperbolas and their asymptotes\", Mathematical Gazette 96, July 2012, 299–301.\n{\\color{magenta}{(2)}} The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to both the asymptotes is the constant \\tfrac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}\\ ,  which can also be written in terms of the eccentricity e as \\left( \\tfrac{b}{e}\\right) ^2.\n\nFrom the equation y=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}\\sqrt{x^2-a^2} of the hyperbola (above) one can derive:\n{\\color{green}{(3)}} The product of the slopes of lines from a point P to the two vertices is the constant b^2/a^2\\ .\n\nIn addition, from (2) above it can be shown that\n{\\color{red}{(4)}} The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to the asymptotes along lines parallel to the asymptotes is the constant \\tfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}.\n\nSemi-latus rectum \n\nThe length of the chord through one of the foci, perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola, is called the latus rectum. One half of it is the semi-latus rectum p. A calculation shows\n*p = \\frac{b^2}a.\nThe semi-latus rectum p may also be viewed as the radius of curvature  of the osculating circles at the vertices.\n\nTangent \n\nThe simplest way to determine the equation of the tangent at a point (x_0,y_0) is to implicitly differentiate the equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 of the hyperbola. Denoting dy/dx as y′, this produces\n\\frac{2x}{a^2}-\\frac{2yy'}{b^2}0 \\ \\rightarrow \\ y'\n\\frac{x}{y}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\ \\rightarrow \\ y=\\frac{x_0}{y_0}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}(x-x_0) +y_0.\nWith respect to \\tfrac{x_0^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y_0^2}{b^2}= 1, the equation of the tangent at point (x_0,y_0) is,\n*\\frac{x_0}{a^2}x-\\frac{y_0}{b^2}y = 1.\n\nA particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections.J. W. Downs, Practical Conic Sections, Dover Publ., 2003 (orig. 1993): p. 26. Let f be the distance from the vertex V (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2f. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.\n\nRectangular hyperbola \n\nIn the case a b the hyperbola is called rectangular (or equilateral), because its asymptotes intersect rectangularly (i.e., are perpendicular). For this case, the linear eccentricity is c\n\\sqrt{2}a, the eccentricity e\\sqrt{2} and the semi-latus rectum p\na.\n\nParametric representation with hyperbolic sine/cosine \n\nUsing the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions \\cosh,\\sinh, a parametric representation of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 can be obtained, which is similar to the parametric representation of an ellipse:\n*(\\pm a \\cosh t, b \\sinh t),\\, t \\in \\R \\ ,\nwhich satisfies the Cartesian equation because \\cosh^2 t -\\sinh^2 t =1 .\n\nFurther parametric representations are given in the section Parametric equations below.\n\nConjugate hyperbola \n\nExchange x and y to obtain the equation of the conjugate hyperbola (see diagram):\n*\\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\\frac{x^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ , also written as \n\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= -1 \\ .\n\nHyperbola with equation y\nA/x \n\nIf the xy-coordinate system is rotated about the origin by the angle -45^\\circ  and new coordinates \\xi,\\eta are assigned, then x\\tfrac{\\xi+\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}},\\; y\n\\tfrac{-\\xi+\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}} . \nThe rectangular hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}1 (whose semi-axes are equal) has the new equation \\tfrac{2\\xi\\eta}{a^2}\n1.\nSolving for \\eta yields \\eta=\\tfrac{a^2/2}{\\xi} \\ . \n\nThus, in an xy-coordinate system the graph of a function f: x\\mapsto \\tfrac{A}{x},\\; A>0\\; ,  with equation\n*y=\\frac{A}{x}\\;, A>0\\; , is a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the first and third quadrants with\n*the coordinate axes as asymptotes,\n*the line y=x as major axis ,\n*the center (0,0) and the semi-axis  ab\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the vertices (\\sqrt{A},\\sqrt{A}), (-\\sqrt{A},-\\sqrt{A}) \\; ,\n*the semi-latus rectum and radius of curvature  at the vertices  pa\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the linear eccentricity c2\\sqrt{A} and the eccentricity e\n\\sqrt{2} \\; ,\n*the tangent y=-\\tfrac{A}{x_0^2}x+2\\tfrac{A}{x_0} at point (x_0,A/x_0)\\; .\n\nA rotation of the original hyperbola by +45^\\circ results in a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the second and fourth quadrants, with the same asymptotes, center, semi-latus rectum, radius of curvature at the vertices, linear eccentricity, and eccentricity as for the case of -45^\\circ rotation, with equation \n*y=\\frac{-A}{x} \\; , A>0\\; ,  \n*the semi-axes  ab\n\\sqrt{2A} \\; ,\n*the line  y=-x as major axis, \n*the vertices (-\\sqrt{A},\\sqrt{A}), (\\sqrt{A},-\\sqrt{A}) \\; .\n\nShifting the hyperbola with equation y=\\frac{A}{x}, \\ A\\ne 0\\ , so that the new center is (c_0,d_0), yields the new equation \n*y=\\frac{A}{x-c_0}+d_0\\; ,\nand the new asymptotes are xc_0  and y\nd_0. \nThe shape parameters a,b,p,c,e remain unchanged.\n\nDefinition of a hyperbola by the directrix property \n\nThe two lines at distance d = \\frac{a^2}c and parallel to the minor axis are called directrices of the hyperbola (see diagram). \n* For an arbitrary point P of the hyperbola the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity:\n:\\frac \\frac \n e= \\frac{c}{a}\\ .\nThe proof for the pair F_1, l_1 follows from the fact that |PF_1|^2(x-c)^2+y^2,\\ |Pl_1|^2\n(x-\\tfrac{a^2}{c})^2 and y^2=\\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}x^2-b^2 satisfy the equation\n|PF_1|^2-\\frac{c^2}{a^2}|Pl_1|^2=0\\ .\nThe second case is proven analogously.\n\nThe inverse statement is also true and can be used to define a hyperbola (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):\n* For any point F (focus), any line l (directrix) not through F and any real number e with e > 1 the set of points (locus of points), for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is e\n:H \\{P \\mid  \\frac \n e\\} \nis a hyperbola.\n\n(The choice e = 1 yields a parabola and if e  an ellipse.)\n\n;Proof:\nLet F=(f,0) ,\\ e >0 and assume (0,0) is a point on the curve. \nThe directrix l has equation x-\\tfrac{f}{e}. With P\n(x,y), the relation |PF|^2=e^2|Pl|^2 produces the equations\n(x-f)^2+y^2e^2(x+\\tfrac{f}{e})^2\n(e x+f)^2 and x^2(e^2-1)+2xf(1+e)-y^2=0.\nThe substitution p=f(1+e) yields\n* x^2(e^2-1)+2px-y^2=0.\nThis is the equation of an ellipse (e) or a parabola  (e=1) or a hyperbola (e>1). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).\n\nIf e>1, introduce new parameters a,b so that\ne^2-1 \\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}, \\text { and }\\ p\n\\tfrac{b^2}{a}, and then the equation above becomes \n\\tfrac{(x+a)^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1\\ ,\nwhich is the equation of a hyperbola with center (-a,0), the x-axis as major axis and\nthe major/minor semi axis a,b.\n\nHyperbola as plane section of a cone  \n\nThe intersection of an upright double cone by a plane not through the vertex with slope greater than the slope of the lines on the cone is a hyperbola (see diagram: red curve). In order to prove the defining property of a hyperbola (see above) one uses two Dandelin spheres d_1, d_2, which are spheres that touch the cone along circles c_1 , c_2  and the intersecting (hyperbola) plane at points F_1 and F_2. It turns out: F_1, F_2 are the foci of the hyperbola.\n# Let  P be an arbitrary point of the intersection curve .\n# The generator (line) of the cone containing P intersects circle c_1 at point A and circle c_2 at a point B.\n# The line segments \\overline{PF_1} and \\overline{PA} are tangential to the sphere d_1 and, hence, are of equal length.\n# The line segments \\overline{PF_2} and \\overline{PB} are tangential to the sphere d_2 and, hence, are of equal length.\n# The result is: |PF_1|-|PF_2||PA|-|PB|\n|AB| is independent of the hyperbola point P.\n\nThe tangent bisects the angle between the lines to the foci \n\nFor a hyperbola the following statement is true:\n* The tangent at a point P bisects the angle between the lines \\overline{PF_1}, \\overline{PF_2}.\n;Proof:\nLet L be the point on the line \\overline{PF_2} with the distance 2a to the focus F_2 (see diagram, a is the semi major axis of the hyperbola). Line w is the bisector of the angle between the lines \\overline{PF_1}, \\overline{PF_2}. In order to prove that w is the tangent line at point P, one checks that any point Q on line w which is different from P cannot be on the hyperbola. Hence w has  only point P in common with the hyperbola and is, therefore, the tangent at point P. \nFrom the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that |QF_2| holds, which means: |QF_2|-|QF_1|. But if Q is a point of the hyperbola, the difference should be 2a.\n\nMidpoints of parallel chords \n\n* The midpoints of parallel chords of a hyperbola lie on a line through the center (see diagram).\nThe points of any chord may lie on different branches of the hyperbola.\n\nThe proof of the property on midpoints is best done for the hyperbola y1/x. Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola y\n1/x (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:\nFor two points P(x_1,\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}), \\ Q\n(x_2,\\tfrac {1 }{x_2}) of the hyperbola y=1/x  \n* the midpoint of the chord is M(\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\cdots)\n\\cdots =\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}\\; (1,\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2}) \\ ;\n* the slope of the chord is \\frac{\\tfrac {1 }{x_2}-\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}}{x_2-x_1}\\cdots \n-\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\ .\nFor parallel chords the slope is constant and the midpoints of the parallel chords lie on the line y=\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\; x \\ .\n\nConsequence: for any pair of points P,Q of a chord there exists a skew reflection with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points P,Q and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line m, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to m.\n\nBecause a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint M of a chord P Q divides the related line segment \\overline P \\, \\overline Q between the asymptotes  into halves, too. This means that |P\\overline P|=|Q\\overline Q|. This property can be used for the construction of further points Q of the hyperbola if a point P and the asymptotes are given.\n\nIf the chord degenerates into a tangent, then the touching point divides the line segment between the asymptotes in two halves.\n\nSteiner generation of a hyperbola \n\nThe following method to construct single points of a hyperbola relies on the Steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section: \n*Given two pencils B(U),B(V) of lines at two points U,V (all lines containing U and  V, respectively) and a projective but not perspective mapping \\pi of B(U) onto B(V), then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non-degenerate projective conic section.\n\nFor the generation of points of the hyperbola \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}1 one uses the pencils at the vertices V_1,V_2. Let P\n(x_0,y_0) be a point of the hyperbola and A(a,y_0), B\n(x_0,0). The line segment  \\overline{BP} is divided into n equally-spaced segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal AB as direction onto the line segment \\overline{AP} (see diagram). The parallel projection is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at V_1 and V_2 needed. The intersection points of any two related lines   S_1A_i and S_2B_i are points of the uniquely defined hyperbola.\n\nRemark: The subdivision could be extended beyond the points A and B in order to get more points, but the determination of the intersection points would become more inaccurate. A better idea is extending the points already constructed by symmetry (see animation).\n\nRemark:\n# The Steiner generation exists for ellipses and parabolas, too. \n# The Steiner generation is sometimes called a parallelogram method because one can use other points rather than the vertices, which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle.\n\nInscribed angles for hyperbolas y\na/(x−b)+c and the 3-point-form \n\nA hyperbola with equation y=\\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c,\\ a \\ne 0  is uniquely determined by three points (x_1,y_1),\\;(x_2,y_2),\\; (x_3,y_3) with different x- and y-coordinates. A simple way to determine the shape parameters a,b,c uses the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas:\n\n*In order to measure an angle between two lines with equations ym_1x+d_1, \\ y\nm_2x + d_2\\ ,m_1,m_2 \\ne 0  in this context one uses the quotient\n:\\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\ .\n\nAnalogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles one gets the\n\nInscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas:,:[http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~ehartmann/circlegeom.pdf E.

If the points are on a hyperbola, one can assume the hyperbola's equation is y=a/x.)\n\nA consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas is the\n\n3-point-form of a hyperbola's equation:\nThe equation of the hyperbola determined by 3 points P_i(x_i,y_i),\\ i\n1,2,3,\\ x_i\\ne x_k, y_i\\ne y_k, i\\ne k is the solution of the equation \n:\\frac{({\\color{red}y}-y_1)}{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_2)}{({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}=\\frac{(y_3-y_1)}{(x_3-x_1)}\\frac{(x_3-x_2)}{(y_3-y_2)}\nfor {\\color{red}y}.\n\nOrthogonal tangents - orthoptic\n\nFor a hyperbola \\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}1, \\, a>b the intersection points of orthogonal tangents lie on the circle x^2+y^2\na^2-b^2. \nThis circle is called the orthoptic of the given hyperbola.\n\nThe tangents may belong to points on different branches of the hyperbola.\n\nIn case of a\\le b there are no pairs of orthogonal tangents.\n\nPole-polar relation for a hyperbola \n\nAny hyperbola can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}1. The equation of the tangent at a point P_0\n(x_0,y_0) of the hyperbola  is \\tfrac{x_0x}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y_0y}{b^2}1. If one allows  point P_0\n(x_0,y_0) to be an arbitrary point different from the origin, then \n* point P_0(x_0,y_0)\\ne(0,0) is mapped onto the line \\frac{x_0x}{a^2}-\\frac{y_0y}{b^2}\n1 , not through the center of the hyperbola. \nThis relation between points and lines is a bijection.\n\nThe inverse function maps\n* line y=mx+d,\\ d\\ne 0 onto the point \\left(-\\frac{ma^2}{d},-\\frac{b^2}{d}\\right) and\nline x=c,\\ c\\ne 0 onto the point \\left(\\frac{a^2}{c},0\\right)\\ .\n\nSuch a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or just polarity. The pole is the point, the polar the line. See Pole and polar.\n\nBy calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the hyperbola:\n* For a point (pole) on the hyperbola the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram: P_1,\\ p_1).\n* For a pole P outside the hyperbola the intersection points of its polar with the hyperbola are the tangency points of the two tangents passing P (see diagram: P_2,\\ p_2,\\ P_3,\\ p_3).\n* For a point within the hyperbola the polar has no point with the hyperbola in common.  (see diagram: P_4,\\ p_4).\n\nRemarks:\n# The intersection point of two polars (for example: p_2,p_3) is the pole of the line through their poles (here: P_2,P_3).\n# The foci (c,0), and  (-c,0) respectively and the directrices x\\tfrac{a^2}{c} and x\n-\\tfrac{a^2}{c} respectively belong to pairs of  pole and polar.\nPole-polar relations exist for ellipses and parabolas, too.\n\nHyperbola as an affine image of the unit hyperbola x²-y²\n1 \n\nAnother definition of a hyperbola uses affine transformations:\n*Any hyperbola is the affine image of the unit hyperbola with equation x^2-y^2=1.\n\nAn affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form \\vec x \\to \\vec f_0+A\\vec x, where A is a regular matrix (its determinant is not 0) and \\vec f_0 is an arbitrary vector. If \\vec f_1, \\vec f_2 are the column vectors of the matrix A, the unit hyperbola (\\pm\\cosh(t),\\sinh(t)), t \\in \\R, is mapped onto the hyperbola\n* \\vec x \\vec p(t)\n\\vec f_0 \\pm\\vec f_1 \\cosh t +\\vec f_2 \\sinh t \\ .\n\\vec f_0 is the center, \\vec f_0+ \\vec f_1 a point of the hyperbola and  \\vec f_2 a tangent vector at this point. In general the vectors \\vec f_1, \\vec f_2 are not perpendicular. That means, in general  \\vec f_0\\pm \\vec f_1 are not the vertices of the hyperbola. But \\vec f_1\\pm \\vec f_2 point into the directions of the asymptotes.\n\nThe tangent vector at point  \\vec p(t) is \n\\vec p'(t) = \\vec f_1\\sinh t  + \\vec f_2\\cosh t \\ .\nBecause at a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola one gets the parameter t_0 of a vertex from the equation \n\\vec p'(t)\\cdot (\\vec p(t) -\\vec f_0) (\\vec f_1\\sinh t + \\vec f_2\\cosh t)\\cdot(\\vec f_1 \\cosh t +\\vec f_2 \\sinh t) \n0\nand hence from\n\\coth (2t_0)= -\\tfrac{\\vec f_1^{\\, 2}+\\vec f_2^{\\, 2}}{2\\vec f_1 \\cdot \\vec f_2} \\ ,\nwhich yields\n*t_0=\\tfrac{1}{4}\\ln\\tfrac{(\\vec f_1-\\vec f_2)^2}{(\\vec f_1+\\vec f_2)^2}.\n\n(The formulae \\cosh^2 x +\\sinh^2 x\\cosh 2x,\\ 2\\sinh x \\cosh x \n \\sinh 2x,\\ \\operatorname{arcoth} x = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln\\tfrac{x+1}{x-1} were used.)\n\nThe two vertices of the hyperbola are  \\vec f_0\\pm(\\vec f_1\\cosh t_0 +\\vec f_2 \\sinh t_0).\n\nThe advantage of this definition is that one gets a simple parametric representation of an arbitrary hyperbola, even in the space, if the vectors \\vec f_0, \\vec f_1, \\vec f_2 are vectors of the Euclidean space.\n\nHyperbola as an affine image of the hyperbola y\n1/x \n\nBecause the unit hyperbola x^2-y^21 is affinely equivalent to the hyperbola y\n1/x, an arbitrary hyperbola can be considered as the affine image (see previous section) of the hyperbola y=1/x\\ :\n*\\vec x\\vec p(t)\n\\vec f_0 + \\vec f_1 t+ \\vec f_2 \\tfrac{1}{t}, \\quad t\\ne 0\\ .\nM: \\vec f_0  is the center of the hyperbola, the vectors \\vec f_1 , \\vec f_2  have the directions of the asymptotes and \\vec f_1 + \\vec f_2  is a point of the hyperbola.

If the last assumption is not fulfilled one can first apply a parameter transformation (see above) in order to make the assumption true. Hence \\pm(\\vec f_1+\\vec f_2) are the vertices, \\pm(\\vec f_1-\\vec f_2) span the minor axis and one gets |\\vec f_1+\\vec f_2|a and |\\vec f_1-\\vec f_2|\nb.\n\nFor the intersection points of the tangent at point \\vec p(t_0)=\\vec f_1 t_0+ \\vec f_2 \\tfrac{1}{t_0} with the asymptotes one gets the points \nC2t_0\\vec f_1,\\ D\n\\tfrac{2}{t_0}\\vec f_2.\nThe area of the triangle M,C,D can be calculated by a 2x2-determinant: \nA\\tfrac{1}{2}|\\det( 2t_0\\vec f_1, \\tfrac{2}{t_0}\\vec f_2)|\n2|\\det(\\vec f_1,\\vec f_2)|\n(see rules for determinants).\n|\\det(\\vec f_1,\\vec f_2)| is the area of the rhombus generated by \\vec f_1,\\vec f_2. The area of a rhombus is equal to one half of the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are the semi-axes a,b of the hyperbola. Hence:\n*The area of the triangle MCD is independent of the point of the hyperbola: A=ab.\n\nPolar coordinates \n\npole = focus: \n\nThe polar coordinates used most commonly for the hyperbola are defined relative to the Cartesian coordinate system that has its origin in a focus and its x-axis pointing towards the origin of the \"canonical coordinate system\" as illustrated in the first diagram.\nIn this case the angle \\varphi is called true anomaly.\n\nRelative to this coordinate system one has that\n*r \\frac{p}{1 \\mp e \\cos \\varphi}, \\quad p\n\\tfrac{b^2}{a}\nand\n-\\arccos \\left(-\\frac 1 e\\right) \n\npole = center:\n\nWith polar coordinates relative to the \"canonical coordinate system\" (see second diagram)\none has that\n*r =\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{e^2 \\cos^2 \\varphi -1}} .\\,\nFor the right branch of the hyperbola the range of  \\varphi  is\n-\\arccos \\left(\\frac 1 e\\right) \n\nParametric equations \n\nA hyperbola with equation \\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1  can be described by several parametric equations:\n1: \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\\quad \\; x \\, \\, \\pm a \\cosh t \\\\ y \\, \n \\, b \\sinh t \\end{matrix}\\right. \\quad ,\\ t \\in \\R \\ .\n2: \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} \\quad \\ x \\, \\, \\pm a\\, \\tfrac{t^2+1}{2t} \\\\ y \\, \n \\, b\\, \\tfrac{t^2-1}{2t} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\quad ,\\ t >0 \\ . (rational representation)\n3: \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\\quad \\ x \\, \\, \\frac{a}{\\cos t}\na\\sec t \\\\ y \\, = \\, \\pm b \\tan t \\end{matrix}\\right. \\ , \\quad 0 \\le t \n\n4: Tangent slope as parameter:\nA parametric representation, which uses the slope m of the tangent at a point of the hyperbola  \ncan be obtained analogously to the ellipse case: Replace in the ellipse case b^2 by -b^2\nand use formulae for the hyperbolic functions. One gets\n\\vec c_\\pm(m) = \\left(-\\frac{ma^2}{\\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\\;,\\;\\frac{-b^2}{\\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\\right) \\ , \\ |m|>b/a \\ .\n\\vec c_- is the upper and \\vec c_+ the lower half of the hyperbola. The points with vertical tangents (vertices  (\\pm a,0)) are not covered by the representation.\nThe equation of the tangent at point \\vec c_\\pm(m) is\ny = m x \\pm\\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}.\nThis description of the tangents of a hyperbola is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of a hyperbola.\n\nOther mathematical definitions\n\nReciprocation of a circle\n\nThe reciprocation of a circle B in a circle C always yields a conic section such as a hyperbola. The process of \"reciprocation in a circle C\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding pole and polar, respectively. The pole of a line is the inversion of its closest point to the circle C, whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to C is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius r of reciprocation circle C. If B and C represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center B must lie outside of the reciprocating circle C.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle B, as well as the envelope of the polar lines of the points on B. Conversely, the circle B is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to B have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle C; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on B are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle B that are separated by these tangent points.\n\nQuadratic equation\n\nA hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) in the plane,\n\nA_{xx} x^2 + 2 A_{xy} xy + A_{yy} y^2 + 2 B_x x + 2 B_y y + C = 0,\n\nprovided that the constants Axx, Axy, Ayy, Bx, By, and C satisfy the determinant condition\n\nD := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix} \n\nThis determinant is conventionally called the discriminant of the conic section., [https://books.google.com/books?id75mAJPcAWT8C&pg\nPA45 Section 3.2, page 45]\n\nA special case of a hyperbola—the degenerate hyperbola consisting of two intersecting lines—occurs when another determinant is zero:\n\n\\Delta :\\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\\\ B_x & B_y & C \\end{vmatrix} \n 0.\n\nThis determinant Δ is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.Korn, Granino A. and Korn, Theresa M.  Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers: Definitions, Theorems, and Formulas for Reference and Review, Dover Publ., second edition, 2000: p. 40.\n\nGiven the above general parametrization of the hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates, the eccentricity can be found using the formula in Conic section#Eccentricity in terms of parameters of the quadratic form.\n\nThe center (xc, yc) of the hyperbola may be determined from the formulae\n\nx_c = -\\frac{1}{D} \\begin{vmatrix} B_x & A_{xy} \\\\ B_y & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix};\n\ny_c = -\\frac 1 D \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & B_y \\end{vmatrix}.\n\nIn terms of new coordinates,  and , the defining equation of the hyperbola can be written\n\nA_{xx} \\xi^2 + 2A_{xy} \\xi\\eta + A_{yy} \\eta^2 + \\frac \\Delta D = 0.\n\nThe principal axes of the hyperbola make an angle φ with the positive x-axis that is given by\n\n\\tan 2\\varphi = \\frac{2A_{xy}}{A_{xx} - A_{yy}}.\n\nRotating the coordinate axes so that the x-axis is aligned with the transverse axis brings the equation into its canonical form\n\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.\n\nThe major and minor semiaxes a and b are defined by the equations\n\na^2 -\\frac \\Delta {\\lambda_1 D} \n -\\frac \\Delta {\\lambda_1^2 \\lambda_2},\n\nb^{2} -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\lambda_{2}D} \n -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}^{2}},\n\nwhere λ1 and λ2 are the roots of the quadratic equation\n\n\\lambda^2 - \\left( A_{xx} + A_{yy} \\right)\\lambda + D = 0.\n\nFor comparison, the corresponding equation for a degenerate hyperbola (consisting of two intersecting lines) is\n\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0.\n\nThe tangent line to a given point (x0, y0) on the hyperbola is defined by the equation\n\nE x + F y + G = 0\n\nwhere E, F and G are defined by\n\nE = A_{xx} x_0 + A_{xy} y_0 + B_x,\n\nF = A_{xy} x_0 + A_{yy} y_0 + B_y,\n\nG = B_x x_0 + B_y y_0 + C.\n\nThe normal line to the hyperbola at the same point is given by the equation\n\nF(x - x_0) - E(y - y_0) = 0.\n\nThe normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, and both pass through the same point (x0, y0).\n\nFrom the equation\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \\qquad 0 \nthe left focus is (-ae,0) and the right focus is (ae,0),  where  is the eccentricity.

The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a central projection onto an image plane, i.e., all projection rays pass a fixed point O, the center. The lens plane is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens O.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \na) a circle, if circle c is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\nb) an ellipse, if c has no point with the lens plane in common,\nc) a parabola, if c has one point with the lens plane in common and\nd) a hyperbola, if c has two points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point O are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point O generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\nDerived curves\n\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by inversion, the so-called inverse curves of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.\n\nElliptic coordinates \n\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of elliptic coordinates in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance c from the origin on the x-axis, and where θ is the angle of the asymptotes with the x-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a conformal map of the Cartesian coordinate system w z + 1/z, where z\n x + iy are the original Cartesian coordinates, and w=u + iv are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping w = z2 transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\nOther properties of hyperbolas\n\n*The following are concurrent: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.[http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html][http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm]\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.\n\nHyperbolic functions\n\nJust as the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the unit hyperbola, as shown in this diagram.\n\nApplications\n\nSundials\n\nHyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\nMultilateration\n\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2a from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2a whose foci are the two given points.\n\nPath followed by a particle\n\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy E of the particle is greater than zero (i.e., if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated the existence of an atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse square law requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\nKorteweg–de Vries equation\n\nThe hyperbolic trig function \\operatorname{sech}\\, x appears as one solution to the Korteweg–de Vries equation which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\nAngle trisection\n\nAs shown first by Apollonius of Perga, a hyperbola can be used to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex O, which intersects the sides of the angle at points A and B. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  A and B and its perpendicular bisector \\ell. Construct a hyperbola of eccentricity e=2 with \\ell as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment OP about the line \\ell obtaining the point P' as the image of P. Segment AP' has the same length as segment BP due to the reflection, while segment PP' has the same length as segment BP due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As OA, OP', OP and OB are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles OAP', OPP' and OPB are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3×POB = AOB.This construction is due to Pappus of Alexandria (circa 300 A.D.) and the proof comes from .\n\nEfficient portfolio frontier\n\nIn portfolio theory, the locus of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.\n\nHyperbolas as plane sections of quadrics \n\nHyperbolas appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:\n* Elliptic cone \n* Hyperbolic cylinder\n* Hyperbolic paraboloid\n* Hyperboloid of one sheet\n* Hyperboloid of two sheets\n\nQuadric Cone.jpg|Elliptic cone\nHyperbolic Cylinder Quadric.png|Hyperbolic cylinder\nHyperbol Paraboloid.pov.png|Hyperbolic paraboloid\nHyperboloid1.png|Hyperboloid of one sheet\nHyperboloid2.png|Hyperboloid of two sheets.
