  "textBody" : "Enrico Bombieri (born 26 November 1940 in Milan) is an Italian mathematician, known for his work in analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, univalent functions, theory of several complex variables, partial differential equations of minimal surfaces, and the theory of finite groups.
