  "textBody" : "Aloe (,), also written Aloë, is a genus containing over 500 species of flowering succulent plants.The Plant List (2010). Version 1. Published on the Internet; http://www.theplantlist.org/ (accessed July 2013) The most widely known species is Aloe vera, or \"true aloe\", so called because it is cultivated as the standard source of so-called \"aloe vera\" for assorted pharmaceutical purposes. Other species, such as Aloe ferox, also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications.\n\nThe APG IV system (2016) places the genus in the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae. Within the subfamily it may be placed in the tribe Aloeae.Stevens, P.F. (2001 onwards), \"[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm#aspasphodelaceae Asphodelaceae]\", Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, retrieved 2016-06-09 In the past, it has been assigned to the family Aloaceae (now included in the Asphodeloidae) or to a broadly circumscribed family Liliaceae (the lily family). The plant Agave americana, which is sometimes called \"American aloe\", belongs to the Asparagaceae, a different family.\n\nThe genus is native to tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, Jordan, the Arabian Peninsula, and various islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion, Comoros, etc.). A few species have also become naturalized in other regions (Mediterranean, India, Australia, North and South America, etc.).\n\nDescription\n\nMost Aloe species have a rosette of large, thick, fleshy leaves. Aloe flowers are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of Aloe appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or mottled. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).\n\nSystematics\n\nThe APG IV system (2016) places the genus in the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae. In the past it has also been assigned to the families Liliaceae and Aloeaceae, as well as the family Asphodelaceae sensu stricto, before this was merged into the Asphodelaceae sensu lato.\n\nThe circumscription of the genus has varied widely. Many genera, such as Lomatophyllum, have been brought into synonymy. Species at one time placed in Aloe, such as Agave americana, have been moved to other genera. Molecular phylogenetic studies, particularly from 2010 onwards, suggested that as then circumscribed, Aloe was not monophyletic and should be divided into more tightly defined genera. In 2014, John Charles Manning and coworkers produced a phylogeny in which Aloe was divided into six genera: Aloidendron, Kumara, Aloiampelos, Aloe, Aristaloe and Gonialoe.\n\nSpecies \n\nOver 500 species are accepted in the genus Aloe, plus even more synonyms and unresolved species, subspecies, varieties, and hybrids. Some of the accepted species are:\n\n*Aloe aculeata  Pole-Evans \n*Aloe africana  Mill. \n*Aloe albida  (Stapf) Reynolds \n*Aloe albiflora  Guillaumin \n*Aloe arborescens  Mill. \n*Aloe arenicola  Reynolds \n*Aloe argenticauda  Merxm. & Giess \n*Aloe bakeri  Scott-Elliot \n*Aloe ballii  Reynolds \n*Aloe ballyi  Reynolds \n*Aloe brevifolia  Mill. \n*Aloe broomii  Schönland \n*Aloe buettneri A.Berger\n*Aloe camperi  Schweinf. \n*Aloe capitata  Baker \n*Aloe comosa  Marloth & A.Berger \n*Aloe cooperi Baker\n*Aloe corallina  Verd. \n*Aloe dewinteri  Giess ex Borman & Hardy \n*Aloe erinacea  D.S.Hardy \n*Aloe excelsa  A.Berger \n*Aloe ferox  Mill. \n*Aloe forbesii  Balf.f. \n*Aloe helenae  Danguy \n*Aloe hereroensis  Engl. \n*Aloe inermis  Forssk. \n*Aloe inyangensis  Christian \n*Aloe jawiyon  S.J.Christie, D.P.Hannon & Oakman ex A.G.Mill. \n*Aloe jucunda  Reynolds \n*Aloe khamiesensis Pillans\n*Aloe kilifiensis  Christian \n*Aloe maculata All.\n*Aloe marlothii  A.Berger \n*Aloe mubendiensis Christian\n*Aloe namibensis  Giess \n*Aloe nyeriensis  Christian & I.Verd. \n*Aloe pearsonii  Schönland \n*Aloe peglerae  Schönland \n*Aloe perfoliata  L. \n*Aloe perryi  Baker \n*Aloe petricola  Pole-Evans \n*Aloe polyphylla  Pillans \n*Aloe rauhii  Reynolds \n*Aloe reynoldsii  Letty \n*Aloe scobinifolia  Reynolds & Bally \n*Aloe sinkatana  Reynolds \n*Aloe squarrosa  Baker ex Balf.f. \n*Aloe striata  Haw. \n*Aloe succotrina  Lam. \n*Aloe suzannae  Decary \n*Aloe thraskii  Baker \n*Aloe vera  (L.) Burm.f. \n*Aloe viridiflora  Reynolds \n*Aloe wildii  (Reynolds) Reynolds \n\nIn addition to the species and hybrids between species within the genus, several hybrids with other genera have been created in cultivation, such as between Aloe and Gasteria (×Gasteraloe), and between Aloe and Astroloba (×Aloloba).\n\nUses\n\nAloe species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots. Many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents. Aloe vera is used both internally and externally on humans as folk or alternative medicine. The plants can also be made into types of special soaps.\n\nNumerous cultivars with mixed or uncertain parentage are grown. Of these, Aloe ‘Lizard Lips’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.\n\nHistorical uses\n\nHistorical use of various aloe species is well documented. Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.\n\nOf the 500+ species, only a few were used traditionally as herbal medicines, Aloe vera again being the most commonly used species. Also included are A. perryi and A. ferox. The Ancient Greeks and Romans used Aloe vera to treat wounds. In the Middle Ages, the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a purgative. Unprocessed aloe that contains aloin is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin.\n\nSome species, particularly Aloe vera, are used in alternative medicine and first aid. Both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally for skin discomforts. As an herbal medicine, Aloe vera juice is commonly used internally for digestive discomfort.\n\nRelatively few studies about possible benefits of aloe gel taken internally have been conducted. Components of Aloe have shown the possibility of inhibiting tumor growth in animal studies, but these effects have not been demonstrated clinically in humans. Some studies in animal models indicate that extracts of Aloe have a significant antihyperglycemic effect, and may be useful in treating Type II diabetes, but these studies have not been confirmed in humans.\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, a potentially deadly product called T-UP is made of concentrated aloe, and promoted as a cancer cure. They say \"there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans\".\n\nAloin in OTC laxative products\n\nOn May 9, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin, the yellow sap of the aloe plant, for use as a laxative ingredient in over-the-counter drug products. Most aloe juices today do not contain significant aloin.\n\nChemical properties \n\nAccording to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C7H2N3O5), chrysammic acid (C7H2N2O6), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados Aloe, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Aloe Socotrina and Zanzibar Aloe, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C17H13O7·H2O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C17H18O7) prismatic crystals. Aloe species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.\n\nFlavoring \n\nAloe perryi, A. barbadensis, A. ferox, and hybrids of this species with A. africana and A. spicata are listed as natural flavoring substances in the US government Electronic Code of Federal Regulations.[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID3a096fd1d813e0b6f476ecd1470e7e4a&node\npt21.3.172&rgndiv5#se21.3.172_1510 §172.510 Natural flavoring substances and natural substances used in conjunction with flavors e-CFR] Aloe socotrina is said to be used in yellow Chartreuse.John Tellman (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id\nS8U1AQAAIAAJ The Practical Hotel Steward], The Hotel Monthly, Chicago\n\nHeraldic occurrence \n\nAloe rubrolutea occurs as a charge in heraldry, for example in the Civic Heraldry of Namibia.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Aloe ferox.JPG|Aloe ferox (\"Bitter Aloe\")\nFile:Aloe africana 1.jpg|Aloe africana (\"Uitenhage Aloe\")\nFile:Gardenology-IMG 5394 hunt10mar.jpg|Aloe marlothii (\"Flat-flowered Aloe\")\nFile:Aloe pluridens (3).jpg|Aloe pluridens (\"French Aloe\")\nFile:Aloe excelsa at Mount Coot-tha.JPG|Aloe excelsa (\"Zimbabwe Aloe\") \nFile:Aloe rupestris, vroeë bloeiwyse, Pretoria.jpg|Aloe rupestris (\"Bottlebrush Aloe\")\nFile:Aloe speciosa - tilt head aloe.jpg|Aloe hexapetala (\"Tilt-headed Aloe\")\nFile:Aloe thraskii close.JPG|Aloe thraskii (\"Dune Aloe\")\nFile:Babosa1.jpg|Aloe arborescens\nFile:Blooming aloes wide view alternate, with bright sun behind.jpg|Blooming Aloe arborescens\nFile:Aloe cooperi in flower IMG 1702e.JPG|Aloe cooperi (Aloe plicatilis in background on the right)\nFile:Aloe hereroensis Auob C15.JPG|Aloe hereroensis\nFile:Aloe parvula.JPG|Aloe parvula\nFile:Aloe peglerae01.jpg|Aloe peglerae\nFile:Aloe saponaria 1.jpg|Aloe maculata - prev.
