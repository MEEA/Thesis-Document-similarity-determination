  "textBody" : "Christian mythology is the body of myths associated with Christianity. The term encompasses a broad variety of stories and legends. Various authors have used it to refer to the mythological and allegorical elements found in the Bible, such as the story of the Leviathan. The term has been applied to myths and legends from the Middle Ages, such as the story of Saint George and the Dragon, the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and the legends of the Parsival. John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost has been classified as a work of \"Christian mythology\" by multiple commentators. The term has also been applied to modern stories revolving around Christian themes and motifs, such as the writings of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and George MacDonald.\n\nMythological themes and elements can be found throughout Christian literature, including recurring myths such as ascending to a mountain, the axis mundi, myths of combat, descent into the Underworld, accounts of a dying-and-rising god, flood stories, stories about the founding of a tribe or city, and myths about great heroes of past, paradises, and self-sacrifice.\n\nChristian attitudes\n\nIn ancient Greek, muthos, from which the English word \"myth\" derives, meant \"story, narrative.\" Early Christians contrasted their sacred stories with \"myths\", by which they meant false and pagan stories.Eliade, Myth and Reality, 162Oleyar 5Barrett 69\n\nSeveral modern Christian writers, such as C.S. Lewis, have described elements of Christianity, particularly the story of Christ, as \"myth\" which is also \"true\" (\"true myth\").Sammons 231Dorrien 236 and throughoutLazo 210 Others object to associating Christianity with \"myth\" for a variety of reasons: the association of the term \"myth\" with polytheism,Henry, chapter 3Tyndale House Publishers 9 the use of the term \"myth\" to indicate falsehood or non-historicity,Nwachukwu 47Holman Bible Publishers 896Hamilton 56-57 and the lack of an agreed-upon definition of \"myth\".Greidanus 23\n\nAs examples of Biblical myths, Every cites the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 and the story of Eve's temptation.Every 22 Many Christians believe parts of the Bible to be symbolic or metaphorical (such as the Creation in Genesis).Lund, Gerald N. [https://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/10/understanding-scriptural-symbols?lang\neng \"Understanding Scriptural Symbol\"]. Ensign Oct. 1986 in print. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints https://www.lds.org/, Web. 09 Jan. 2015.\n\nHistorical development\n\nOld Testament\n\nMythic patterns such as the primordial struggle between good and evil appear in passages throughout the Hebrew Bible, including passages that describe historical events.McGinn 18-20 A distinctive characteristic of the Hebrew Bible is the reinterpretation of myth on the basis of history, as in the Book of Daniel, a record of the experience of the Jews of the Second Temple period under foreign rule, presented as a prophecy of future events and expressed in terms of \"mythic structures\" with \"the Hellenistic kingdom figured as a terrifying monster that cannot but recall [the Near Eastern pagan myth of] the dragon of chaos\".\n\nMircea Eliade argues that the imagery used in some parts of the Hebrew Bible reflects a \"transfiguration of history into myth\".Eliade, Cosmos and History, 37 For example, Eliade says, the portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar as a dragon in Jeremiah 51:34 is a case in which the Hebrews \"interpreted contemporary events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a hero and a dragon.Eliade, Cosmos and History, 38\n\nAccording to scholars including Neil Forsyth and John L. McKenzie, the Old Testament incorporates stories, or fragments of stories, from extra-biblical mythology.Forsyth 9-10McKenzie 56 According to the New American Bible, a Catholic Bible translation produced by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the story of the Nephilim in Genesis 6:1-4 \"is apparently a fragment of an old legend that had borrowed much from ancient mythology\", and the \"sons of God\" mentioned in that passage are \"celestial beings of mythology\".Footnotes [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/genesis/genesis6.htm#foot2 on Revelation 6:1-4] and [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/genesis/genesis6.htm#foot2 on Revelation 6:2] in the New American Bible. The New American Bible also says that Psalm 93 alludes to \"an ancient myth\" in which God battles a personified Sea.[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm93.htm#foot1 Footnote on Psalm 93] in the New American Bible Some scholars have identified the biblical creature Leviathan as a monster from Canaanite mythology.In a [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm29.htm#foot3 footnote on Psalm 29:3], the New American Bible identifies Leviathan as \"the seven-headed sea monster of Canaanite mythology\".Forsyth 65: \"[In Job 26:5-14] Yahweh defeats the various enemies of the Canaanite myths, including Rahab, another name for the dragon Leviathan.\" According to Howard Schwartz, \"the myth of the fall of Lucifer\" existed in fragmentary form in Isaiah 14:12 and other ancient Jewish literature; Schwartz claims that the myth originated from \"the ancient Canaanite myth of Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule the underworld instead\".Schwartz 108\n\nSome scholars have argued that the calm, orderly, monotheistic creation story in Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a reaction against the creation myths of other Near Eastern cultures.David and Margaret Leeming contrast the \"structured, majestic, logical, somewhat demythologized\" creation story in Genesis 1 with the \"high-paced, capricious, ritualistic, magic-filled drama\" of other Near Eastern creation myths (Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 113-14). They add, \"One could [...] say this story was written in reaction to creation myths of nearby cultures [...] In other Near Eastern mythologies, the sun and moon are gods who have names and rule. P [i.e. the textual source from which Genesis 1 is drawn] tells of their creation on the fourth day as simply luminaries without name or function except to keep time. [...] While in the Enuma Elish the earth and its inhabitants are created almost haphazardly, as needed, Elohim creates with an unalterable plan in mind\" (Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 116).John L. McKenzie calls Genesis 1 \"a deliberate polemic against the [Near Eastern] creation myth. Polytheism is removed, and with it the theogony and the theomachy which are so vital in the Mesopotamian form of the myth. [...] The act of creation is achieved in entire tranquility\" (McKenzie 57). In connection with this interpretation, David and Margaret Leeming describe Genesis 1 as a \"demythologized myth\",Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 116; see also Leeming 115 and John L. McKenzie asserts that the writer of Genesis 1 has \"excised the mythical elements\" from his creation story.McKenzie 57\n\nPerhaps the most famous topic in the Bible that could possibly be connected with mythical origins is the topic of Heaven (or the sky) as the place where God (or angels, or the saints) resides,Psalms 68:5Psalms 104:2-4Psalms 29:10Matthew 6:26. Greek original uses the word ουρανού (ouranou, like the Greek god of heavens, Uranus) to describe the birds, the same later to describe the Father.

From thence He will come again to judge the living and the dead\".[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a6.htm]Compare also with the Lord's Prayer, a central prayer in Christianity.

Pr., 1994. David C. Lindberg, The Beginnings of Western Science, pp. 249-50, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. See also Wiki articles on Celestial spheres and Giordano Bruno, where 2 scanned cosmographies from medieval books are included. In each one the outermost text reads \"The heavenly empire, dwelling of God and all the selected\" (later attacked, amongst others, by Giordano Bruno). Some famous opponents of religion, including John LennonJohn Lennon, Imagine and Stephen Hawking,Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time, c. 1, p. 4 just below the picture, Bantam 1998,  mentioned this in their public works.\n\nNew Testament and early Christianity\n\nAccording to a number of scholars, the Christ story contains mythical themes such as descent to the underworld, the heroic monomyth, and the \"dying god\" (see section below on \"mythical themes and types\").Leeming, \"Christian Mythology\"Dundes, \"The Hero Pattern and the Life of Jesus\", 186Leeming, \"Dying God\"Leeming, \"Descent to the underworld\"\n\nSome scholars have argued that the Book of Revelation incorporates imagery from ancient mythology. According to the New American Bible, the image in Revelation 12:1-6 of a pregnant woman in the sky, threatened by a dragon, \"corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster\".[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/revelation/revelation12.htm#foot2 Footnote on Revelation 12:1] in the New American Bible. Bernard McGinn suggests that the image of the two Beasts in Revelation stems from a \"mythological background\" involving the figures of Leviathan and Behemoth.McGinn 54\n\nThe Pastoral Epistles contain denunciations of \"myths\" (muthoi). This may indicate that Rabbinic or Gnostic mythology was popular among the early Christians to whom the epistles were written and that the epistles' author was attempting to resist that mythology.Barrett 69-71 mentions both Rabbinic and gnostic mythology as a possibility.[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/1timothy/1timothy6.htm#foot8 A footnote on 1 Timothy 6:20-21] in the New American Bible refers only to the possibility of gnostic mythology, not of Rabbinic mythology.\n\nThe Sibylline oracles contain predictions that the dead Roman Emperor Nero, infamous for his persecutions, would return one day as an Antichrist-like figure. According to Bernard McGinn, these parts of the oracles were probably written by a Christian and incorporated \"mythological language\" in describing Nero's return.McGinn 47\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the Middle Ages witnessed \"an upwelling of mythical thought\" in which each social group had its own \"mythological traditions\".Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 82 Often a profession had its own \"origin myth\" which established models for members of the profession to imitate; for example, the knights tried to imitate Lancelot or Parsifal. The medieval trouveres developed a \"mythology of woman and Love\" which incorporated Christian elements but, in some cases, ran contrary to official church teaching.\n\nGeorge Every includes a discussion of medieval legends in his book Christian Mythology. Some medieval legends elaborated upon the lives of Christian figures such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. For example, a number of legends describe miraculous events surrounding Mary's birth and her marriage to Joseph.According to one legend, Anna, Christ's maternal grandmother, initially cannot conceive; in response to Anna's lament, an angel appears and tells her that she will have a child (Mary) who will be spoken of throughout the world (Every 76-77). Some medieval legends about Mary's youth describe her as living \"a life of ideal asceticism\", fed by angels. In these legends, an angel tells Zacharias, the future father of John the Baptist, to assemble the local widowers; after the widowers have been assembled, some miracle indicates that, among them, Joseph is to be Mary's wife (according to one version of the legend, a dove comes from Joseph's rod and settles on his head) (Every 78).\n\nIn many cases, medieval mythology appears to have inherited elements from myths of pagan gods and heroes.Every 94, 96Eliade, Myth and Reality, 162-181 According to Every, one example may be \"the myth of St. George\" and other stories about saints battling dragons, which were \"modelled no doubt in many cases on older representations of the creator and preserver of the world in combat with chaos\".Every 95 Eliade notes that some \"mythological traditions\" of medieval knights, namely the Arthurian cycle and the Grail theme, combine a veneer of Christianity with traditions regarding the Celtic Otherworld. According to Lorena Laura Stookey, \"many scholars\" see a link between stories in \"Irish-Celtic mythology\" about journeys to the Otherworld in search of a cauldron of rejuvenation and medieval accounts of the quest for the Holy Grail.Stookey 153\n\nAccording to Eliade, \"eschatological myths\" became prominent during the Middle Ages during \"certain historical movements\".Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 83 These eschatological myths appeared \"in the Crusades, in the movements of a Tanchelm and an Eudes de l'Etoile, in the elevation of Fredrick II to the rank of Messiah, and in many other collective messianic, utopian, and prerevolutionary phenomena\". One significant eschatological myth, introduced by Gioacchino da Fiore's theology of history, was the \"myth of an imminent third age that will renew and complete history\" in a \"reign of the Holy Spirit\"; this \"Gioacchinian myth\" influenced a number of messianic movements that arose in the late Middle Ages.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 84-85\n\nRenaissance and Reformation\n\nDuring the Renaissance, there arose a critical attitude that sharply distinguished between apostolic tradition and what George Every calls \"subsidiary mythology\"—popular legends surrounding saints, relics, the cross, etc.—suppressing the latter.Every 21\n\nThe works of Renaissance writers often included and expanded upon Christian and non-Christian stories such as those of creation and the Fall. Rita Oleyar describes these writers as \"on the whole, reverent and faithful to the primal myths, but filled with their own insights into the nature of God, man, and the universe\".Oleyar 40-41 An example is John Milton's Paradise Lost, an \"epic elaboration of the Judeo-Christian mythology\" and also a \"veritable encyclopedia of myths from the Greek and Roman tradition\".\n\nAccording to Cynthia Stewart, during the Reformation, the Protestant reformers used \"the founding myths of Christianity\" to critique the church of their time.Stewart 72-73\n\nEvery argues that \"the disparagement of myth in our own civilization\" stems partly from objections to perceived idolatry, objections which intensified in the Reformation, both among Protestants and among Catholics reacting against the classical mythology revived during the Renaissance.Every 11\n\nEnlightenment\n\nThe philosophes of the Enlightenment used criticism of myth as a vehicle for veiled criticisms of the Bible and the church.Lincoln 49 According to Bruce Lincoln, the philosophes \"made irrationality the hallmark of myth and constituted philosophy—rather than the Christian kerygma—as the antidote for mythic discourse. By implication, Christianity could appear as a more recent, powerful, and dangerous instance of irrational myth\".Lincoln 50\n\nModern period\n\nSome commentators have categorized a number of modern fantasy works as \"Christian myth\" or \"Christian mythopoeia\". Examples include the fiction of C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George MacDonald.Hein, throughoutAn example of this kind of \"mythopoeic\" literary criticism can be found in Oziewicz 178: \"What L'Engle's Christian myth is and in what sense her Time Quartet qualifies as Christian mythopoeia can thus be glimpsed from both critical assessment of her work and her own reflection as presented in interviews and her voluminous non-fiction.\"\n\nIn The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden, written in 1968, David W. Noble argued that the Adam figure had been \"the central myth in the American novel since 1830\".The full title of Noble's book is The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden: The Central Myth in the American Novel since 1830. As examples, he cites the works of Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Hemingway, and Faulkner.\n\nMythical themes and types\n\nAscending the mountain\n\nAccording to Lorena Laura Stookey, many myths feature sacred mountains as \"the sites of revelations\": \"In myth, the ascent of the holy mountain is a spiritual journey, promising purification, insight, wisdom, or knowledge of the sacred\".Stookey 164 As examples of this theme, Stookey includes the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, Christ's ascent of a mountain to deliver his Sermon on the Mount, and Christ's ascension into Heaven from the Mount of Olives.\n\nAxis mundi\n\nMany mythologies involve a \"world center\", which is often the sacred place of creation; this center often takes the form of a tree, mountain, or other upright object, which serves as an axis mundi or axle of the world.Leeming, Creation Myths of the World, 307Eliade, Cosmos and History, 12Every 51 A number of scholars have connected the Christian story of the crucifixion at Golgotha with this theme of a cosmic center. In his Creation Myths of the World, David Leeming argues that, in the Christian story of the crucifixion, the cross serves as \"the axis mundi, the center of a new creation\".\n\nAccording to a tradition preserved in Eastern Christian folklore, Golgotha was the summit of the cosmic mountain at the center of the world and the location where Adam had been both created and buried. According to this tradition, when Christ is crucified, his blood falls on Adam's skull, buried at the foot of the cross, and redeems him.Eliade, Myth and Reality, 14 George Every discusses the connection between the cosmic center and Golgotha in his book Christian Mythology, noting that the image of Adam's skull beneath the cross appears in many medieval representations of the crucifixion.\n\nIn Creation Myths of the World, Leeming suggests that the Garden of Eden may also be considered a world center.\n\nCombat myth\n\nMany Near Eastern religions include a story about a battle between a divine being and a dragon or other monster representing chaos—a theme found, for example, in the Enuma Elish. A number of scholars call this story the \"combat myth\".McGinn 22Forsyth 126Murphy 279 A number of scholars have argued that the ancient Israelites incorporated the combat myth into their religious imagery, such as the figures of Leviathan and Rahab,McGinn 24Murphy 281-82 the Song of the Sea, Isaiah 51:9-10's description of God's deliverance of his people from Babylon, and the portrayals of enemies such as Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar.Murphy 281 The idea of Satan as God's opponent may have developed under the influence of the combat myth.Forsyth 124 Scholars have also suggested that the Book of Revelation uses combat myth imagery in its descriptions of cosmic conflict.McGinn 57\n\nDescent to the underworld\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, Christ descended to hell after his death, in order to free the souls there; this event is known as the Harrowing of Hell. This story is narrated in the Gospel of Nicodemus and may be the meaning behind 1 Peter 3:18-22.Every 65-66Every also sees New Testament references to the general resurrection (e.g. in John 5:25-29) as connected with the harrowing of hell, because he believes that early Christianity did not distinguish clearly between the Christ's liberation of souls from hell and the general resurrection (Every 66). According to David Leeming, writing in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, the harrowing of hell is an example of the motif of the hero's descent to the underworld, which is common in many mythologies.\n\nDying god\n\nMany myths, particularly from the Near East, feature a god who dies and is resurrected; this figure is sometimes called the \"dying god\".Burkert 99Stookey 99 An important study of this figure is James George Frazer's The Golden Bough, which traces the dying god theme through a large number of myths.Miles 193-94 The dying god is often associated with fertility.Stookey 107 A number of scholars, including Frazer,Miles 194 have suggested that the Christ story is an example of the \"dying god\" theme.Sowa 351 In the article \"Dying god\" in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming notes that Christ can be seen as bringing fertility, though of a spiritual as opposed to physical kind.\n\nIn his 2006 homily for Corpus Christi, Pope Benedict XVI noted the similarity between the Christian story of the resurrection and pagan myths of dead and resurrected gods: \"In these myths, the soul of the human person, in a certain way, reached out toward that God made man, who, humiliated unto death on a cross, in this way opened the door of life to all of us.\"[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2006/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20060615_corpus-christi.html HOMILY OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI Saint John Lateran Thursday, 15 June 2006]\n\nFlood myths\n\nMany cultures have myths about a flood that cleanses the world in preparation for rebirth.Leeming, \"Flood\"Stookey 53 Such stories appear on every inhabited continent on earth. An example is the biblical story of Noah.Stookey 55 In The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming notes that, in the Bible story, as in other flood myths, the flood marks a new beginning and a second chance for creation and humanity.\n\nFounding myths\n\nAccording to Sandra Frankiel, the records of \"Jesus' life and death, his acts and words\" provide the \"founding myths\" of Christianity.Frankiel 57 Frankiel claims that these founding myths are \"structurally equivalent\" to the creation myths in other religions, because they are \"the pivot around which the religion turns to and which it returns\", establishing the \"meaning\" of the religion and the \"essential Christian practices and attitudes\". Tom Cain uses the expression \"founding myths\" more broadly, to encompass such stories as those of the War in Heaven and the fall of man; according to Cain, \"the disastrous consequences of disobedience\" is a pervasive theme in Christian founding myths.Cain 84\n\nHero myths\n\nIn his influential 1909 work Der Mythus von der Geburt des Helden (The Myth of the Birth of the Hero), Otto Rank argued that the births of many mythical heroes follow a common pattern. Rank includes the story of Christ's birth as a representative example of this pattern.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, one pervasive mythical theme associates heroes with the slaying of dragons, a theme which Eliade traces back to \"the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a divine hero and a dragon. He cites the Christian legend of Saint George as an example of this theme.Eliade, Cosmos and History, 39 An example from the later Middle Ages comes from Dieudonné de Gozon, third Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, famous for slaying the dragon of Malpasso. Eliade writes:\n\n\"Legend, as was natural, bestowed upon him the attributes of St. George, famed for his victorious fight with the monster. […] In other words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero, de Gozon was identified with a category, an archetype, which […] equipped him with a mythical biography from which it was impossible to omit combat with a reptilian monster.\"\n\nIn the Oxford Companion to World Mythology David Leeming lists Moses, Jesus, and King Arthur as examples of the \"heroic monomyth\",Leeming, \"Heroic monomyth\" calling the Christ story \"a particularly complete example of the heroic monomyth\". Leeming regards resurrection as a common part of the heroic monomyth,Leeming, \"Resurrection\" in which the resurrected heroes often become sources of \"material or spiritual food for their people\"; in this connection, Leeming notes that Christians regard Jesus as the \"bread of life\".\n\nIn terms of values, Leeming contrasts \"the myth of Jesus\" with the myths of other \"Christian heroes such as St. George, Roland, el Cid, and even King Arthur\"; the later hero myths, Leeming argues, reflect the survival of pre-Christian heroic values—\"values of military dominance and cultural differentiation and hegemony\"—more than the values expressed in the Christ story.\n\nParadise\n\nMany religious and mythological systems contain myths about a paradise. Many of these myths involve the loss of a paradise that existed at the beginning of the world. Some scholars have seen in the story of the Garden of Eden an instance of this general motif.Leeming, \"Paradise myths\"Stookey 5, 91\n\nSacrifice\n\nSacrifice is an element in many religious traditions and often represented in myths. In The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming lists the story of Abraham and Isaac and the story of Christ's death as examples of this theme.Leeming, \"Sacrifice\" Wendy Doniger describes the gospel accounts as a \"meta-myth\" in which Jesus realizes that he is part of a \"new myth [...] of a man who is sacrificed in hate\" but \"sees the inner myth, the old myth of origins and acceptance, the myth of a god who sacrifices himself in love\".Doniger 112\n\nAttitudes toward time\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, many traditional societies have a cyclic sense of time, periodically reenacting mythical events.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 72-73 Through this reenactment, these societies achieve an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age.Wendy Doniger, Forward to Eliade, Shamanism, xiii According to Eliade, Christianity retains a sense of cyclical time, through the ritual commemoration of Christ's life and the imitation of Christ's actions; Eliade calls this sense of cyclical time a \"mythical aspect\" of Christianity.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 78\n\nHowever, Judeo-Christian thought also makes an \"innovation of the first importance\", Eliade says, because it embraces the notion of linear, historical time; in Christianity, \"time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time\".Eliade, Myth and Reality, 65. See also Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 79 Summarizing Eliade's statements on this subject, Eric Rust writes, \"A new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam—history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. [...] The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.\"Rust 60\n\nHeinrich Zimmer also notes Christianity's emphasis on linear time; he attributes this emphasis specifically to the influence of Saint Augustine's theory of history.Zimmer 19 Zimmer does not explicitly describe the cyclical conception of time as itself \"mythical\" per se, although he notes that this conception \"underl[ies] Hindu mythology\".Zimmmer 20\n\nNeil Forsyth writes that \"what distinguishes both Jewish and Christian religious systems [...] is that they elevate to the sacred status of myth narratives that are situated in historical time\".Forsyth 9\n\nLegacy\n\nConcepts of progress\n\nAccording to Carl Mitcham, \"the Christian mythology of progress toward transcendent salvation\" created the conditions for modern ideas of scientific and technological progress.Mitcham, in Davison 70 Hayden White describes \"the myth of Progress\" as the \"secular, Enlightenment counterpart\" of \"Christian myth\".White 65 Reinhold Niebuhr described the modern idea of ethical and scientific progress as \"really a rationalized version of the Christian myth of salvation\".Naveh 42\n\nPolitical and philosophical ideas\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the medieval \"Gioacchinian myth [...] of universal renovation in a more or less imminent future\" has influenced a number of modern theories of history, such as those of Lessing (who explicitly compares his views to those of medieval \"enthusiasts\"), Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling; and has also influenced a number of Russian writers.\n\nCalling Marxism \"a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology\", Eliade writes that Marxism \"takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the proletariat), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world\".Eliade, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, in Ellwood 91–92\n\nIn his article \"The Christian Mythology of Socialism\", Will Herberg argues that socialism inherits the structure of its ideology from the influence of Christian mythology upon western thought.Herberg 131\n\nIn The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming claims that Judeo-Christian messianic ideas have influenced 20th-century totalitarian systems, citing the state ideology of the Soviet Union as an example.Leeming, \"Religion and myth\"\n\nAccording to Hugh S. Pyper, the biblical \"founding myths of the Exodus and the exile, read as stories in which a nation is forged by maintaining its ideological and racial purity in the face of an oppressive great power\", entered \"the rhetoric of nationalism throughout European history\", especially in Protestant countries and smaller nations.Pyper 333\n\nChristmas stories in popular culture\n\nSee Secular Christmas stories, Christmas in the media, and Christmas in literature.",

Lewis, have described elements of Christianity, particularly the story of Christ, as \"myth\" which is also \"true\" (\"true myth\").Sammons 231Dorrien 236 and throughoutLazo 210 Others object to associating Christianity with \"myth\" for a variety of reasons: the association of the term \"myth\" with polytheism,Henry, chapter 3Tyndale House Publishers 9 the use of the term \"myth\" to indicate falsehood or non-historicity,Nwachukwu 47Holman Bible Publishers 896Hamilton 56-57 and the lack of an agreed-upon definition of \"myth\".Greidanus 23\n\nAs examples of Biblical myths, Every cites the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 and the story of Eve's temptation.Every 22 Many Christians believe parts of the Bible to be symbolic or metaphorical (such as the Creation in Genesis).Lund, Gerald N. [https://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/10/understanding-scriptural-symbols?lang\neng \"Understanding Scriptural Symbol\"]. Ensign Oct. 1986 in print. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints https://www.lds.org/, Web. 09 Jan. 2015.\n\nHistorical development\n\nOld Testament\n\nMythic patterns such as the primordial struggle between good and evil appear in passages throughout the Hebrew Bible, including passages that describe historical events.McGinn 18-20 A distinctive characteristic of the Hebrew Bible is the reinterpretation of myth on the basis of history, as in the Book of Daniel, a record of the experience of the Jews of the Second Temple period under foreign rule, presented as a prophecy of future events and expressed in terms of \"mythic structures\" with \"the Hellenistic kingdom figured as a terrifying monster that cannot but recall [the Near Eastern pagan myth of] the dragon of chaos\".\n\nMircea Eliade argues that the imagery used in some parts of the Hebrew Bible reflects a \"transfiguration of history into myth\".Eliade, Cosmos and History, 37 For example, Eliade says, the portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar as a dragon in Jeremiah 51:34 is a case in which the Hebrews \"interpreted contemporary events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a hero and a dragon.Eliade, Cosmos and History, 38\n\nAccording to scholars including Neil Forsyth and John L. McKenzie, the Old Testament incorporates stories, or fragments of stories, from extra-biblical mythology.Forsyth 9-10McKenzie 56 According to the New American Bible, a Catholic Bible translation produced by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the story of the Nephilim in Genesis 6:1-4 \"is apparently a fragment of an old legend that had borrowed much from ancient mythology\", and the \"sons of God\" mentioned in that passage are \"celestial beings of mythology\".Footnotes [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/genesis/genesis6.htm#foot2 on Revelation 6:1-4] and [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/genesis/genesis6.htm#foot2 on Revelation 6:2] in the New American Bible. The New American Bible also says that Psalm 93 alludes to \"an ancient myth\" in which God battles a personified Sea.[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm93.htm#foot1 Footnote on Psalm 93] in the New American Bible Some scholars have identified the biblical creature Leviathan as a monster from Canaanite mythology.In a [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm29.htm#foot3 footnote on Psalm 29:3], the New American Bible identifies Leviathan as \"the seven-headed sea monster of Canaanite mythology\".Forsyth 65: \"[In Job 26:5-14] Yahweh defeats the various enemies of the Canaanite myths, including Rahab, another name for the dragon Leviathan.\" According to Howard Schwartz, \"the myth of the fall of Lucifer\" existed in fragmentary form in Isaiah 14:12 and other ancient Jewish literature; Schwartz claims that the myth originated from \"the ancient Canaanite myth of Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule the underworld instead\".Schwartz 108\n\nSome scholars have argued that the calm, orderly, monotheistic creation story in Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a reaction against the creation myths of other Near Eastern cultures.David and Margaret Leeming contrast the \"structured, majestic, logical, somewhat demythologized\" creation story in Genesis 1 with the \"high-paced, capricious, ritualistic, magic-filled drama\" of other Near Eastern creation myths (Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 113-14). They add, \"One could [...] say this story was written in reaction to creation myths of nearby cultures [...] In other Near Eastern mythologies, the sun and moon are gods who have names and rule. P [i.e. the textual source from which Genesis 1 is drawn] tells of their creation on the fourth day as simply luminaries without name or function except to keep time. [...] While in the Enuma Elish the earth and its inhabitants are created almost haphazardly, as needed, Elohim creates with an unalterable plan in mind\" (Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 116).John L. McKenzie calls Genesis 1 \"a deliberate polemic against the [Near Eastern] creation myth. Polytheism is removed, and with it the theogony and the theomachy which are so vital in the Mesopotamian form of the myth. [...] The act of creation is achieved in entire tranquility\" (McKenzie 57). In connection with this interpretation, David and Margaret Leeming describe Genesis 1 as a \"demythologized myth\",Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths, 116; see also Leeming 115 and John L. McKenzie asserts that the writer of Genesis 1 has \"excised the mythical elements\" from his creation story.McKenzie 57\n\nPerhaps the most famous topic in the Bible that could possibly be connected with mythical origins is the topic of Heaven (or the sky) as the place where God (or angels, or the saints) resides,Psalms 68:5Psalms 104:2-4Psalms 29:10Matthew 6:26. Greek original uses the word ουρανού (ouranou, like the Greek god of heavens, Uranus) to describe the birds, the same later to describe the Father.

From thence He will come again to judge the living and the dead\".[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a6.htm]Compare also with the Lord's Prayer, a central prayer in Christianity.

See also Wiki articles on Celestial spheres and Giordano Bruno, where 2 scanned cosmographies from medieval books are included. In each one the outermost text reads \"The heavenly empire, dwelling of God and all the selected\" (later attacked, amongst others, by Giordano Bruno). Some famous opponents of religion, including John LennonJohn Lennon, Imagine and Stephen Hawking,Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time, c. 1, p. 4 just below the picture, Bantam 1998,  mentioned this in their public works.\n\nNew Testament and early Christianity\n\nAccording to a number of scholars, the Christ story contains mythical themes such as descent to the underworld, the heroic monomyth, and the \"dying god\" (see section below on \"mythical themes and types\").Leeming, \"Christian Mythology\"Dundes, \"The Hero Pattern and the Life of Jesus\", 186Leeming, \"Dying God\"Leeming, \"Descent to the underworld\"\n\nSome scholars have argued that the Book of Revelation incorporates imagery from ancient mythology. According to the New American Bible, the image in Revelation 12:1-6 of a pregnant woman in the sky, threatened by a dragon, \"corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster\".[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/revelation/revelation12.htm#foot2 Footnote on Revelation 12:1] in the New American Bible. Bernard McGinn suggests that the image of the two Beasts in Revelation stems from a \"mythological background\" involving the figures of Leviathan and Behemoth.McGinn 54\n\nThe Pastoral Epistles contain denunciations of \"myths\" (muthoi). This may indicate that Rabbinic or Gnostic mythology was popular among the early Christians to whom the epistles were written and that the epistles' author was attempting to resist that mythology.Barrett 69-71 mentions both Rabbinic and gnostic mythology as a possibility.[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/1timothy/1timothy6.htm#foot8 A footnote on 1 Timothy 6:20-21] in the New American Bible refers only to the possibility of gnostic mythology, not of Rabbinic mythology.\n\nThe Sibylline oracles contain predictions that the dead Roman Emperor Nero, infamous for his persecutions, would return one day as an Antichrist-like figure. According to Bernard McGinn, these parts of the oracles were probably written by a Christian and incorporated \"mythological language\" in describing Nero's return.McGinn 47\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the Middle Ages witnessed \"an upwelling of mythical thought\" in which each social group had its own \"mythological traditions\".Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 82 Often a profession had its own \"origin myth\" which established models for members of the profession to imitate; for example, the knights tried to imitate Lancelot or Parsifal. The medieval trouveres developed a \"mythology of woman and Love\" which incorporated Christian elements but, in some cases, ran contrary to official church teaching.\n\nGeorge Every includes a discussion of medieval legends in his book Christian Mythology. Some medieval legends elaborated upon the lives of Christian figures such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. For example, a number of legends describe miraculous events surrounding Mary's birth and her marriage to Joseph.According to one legend, Anna, Christ's maternal grandmother, initially cannot conceive; in response to Anna's lament, an angel appears and tells her that she will have a child (Mary) who will be spoken of throughout the world (Every 76-77). Some medieval legends about Mary's youth describe her as living \"a life of ideal asceticism\", fed by angels. In these legends, an angel tells Zacharias, the future father of John the Baptist, to assemble the local widowers; after the widowers have been assembled, some miracle indicates that, among them, Joseph is to be Mary's wife (according to one version of the legend, a dove comes from Joseph's rod and settles on his head) (Every 78).\n\nIn many cases, medieval mythology appears to have inherited elements from myths of pagan gods and heroes.Every 94, 96Eliade, Myth and Reality, 162-181 According to Every, one example may be \"the myth of St. George\" and other stories about saints battling dragons, which were \"modelled no doubt in many cases on older representations of the creator and preserver of the world in combat with chaos\".Every 95 Eliade notes that some \"mythological traditions\" of medieval knights, namely the Arthurian cycle and the Grail theme, combine a veneer of Christianity with traditions regarding the Celtic Otherworld. According to Lorena Laura Stookey, \"many scholars\" see a link between stories in \"Irish-Celtic mythology\" about journeys to the Otherworld in search of a cauldron of rejuvenation and medieval accounts of the quest for the Holy Grail.Stookey 153\n\nAccording to Eliade, \"eschatological myths\" became prominent during the Middle Ages during \"certain historical movements\".Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 83 These eschatological myths appeared \"in the Crusades, in the movements of a Tanchelm and an Eudes de l'Etoile, in the elevation of Fredrick II to the rank of Messiah, and in many other collective messianic, utopian, and prerevolutionary phenomena\". One significant eschatological myth, introduced by Gioacchino da Fiore's theology of history, was the \"myth of an imminent third age that will renew and complete history\" in a \"reign of the Holy Spirit\"; this \"Gioacchinian myth\" influenced a number of messianic movements that arose in the late Middle Ages.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 84-85\n\nRenaissance and Reformation\n\nDuring the Renaissance, there arose a critical attitude that sharply distinguished between apostolic tradition and what George Every calls \"subsidiary mythology\"—popular legends surrounding saints, relics, the cross, etc.—suppressing the latter.Every 21\n\nThe works of Renaissance writers often included and expanded upon Christian and non-Christian stories such as those of creation and the Fall. Rita Oleyar describes these writers as \"on the whole, reverent and faithful to the primal myths, but filled with their own insights into the nature of God, man, and the universe\".Oleyar 40-41 An example is John Milton's Paradise Lost, an \"epic elaboration of the Judeo-Christian mythology\" and also a \"veritable encyclopedia of myths from the Greek and Roman tradition\".\n\nAccording to Cynthia Stewart, during the Reformation, the Protestant reformers used \"the founding myths of Christianity\" to critique the church of their time.Stewart 72-73\n\nEvery argues that \"the disparagement of myth in our own civilization\" stems partly from objections to perceived idolatry, objections which intensified in the Reformation, both among Protestants and among Catholics reacting against the classical mythology revived during the Renaissance.Every 11\n\nEnlightenment\n\nThe philosophes of the Enlightenment used criticism of myth as a vehicle for veiled criticisms of the Bible and the church.Lincoln 49 According to Bruce Lincoln, the philosophes \"made irrationality the hallmark of myth and constituted philosophy—rather than the Christian kerygma—as the antidote for mythic discourse. By implication, Christianity could appear as a more recent, powerful, and dangerous instance of irrational myth\".Lincoln 50\n\nModern period\n\nSome commentators have categorized a number of modern fantasy works as \"Christian myth\" or \"Christian mythopoeia\". Examples include the fiction of C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George MacDonald.Hein, throughoutAn example of this kind of \"mythopoeic\" literary criticism can be found in Oziewicz 178: \"What L'Engle's Christian myth is and in what sense her Time Quartet qualifies as Christian mythopoeia can thus be glimpsed from both critical assessment of her work and her own reflection as presented in interviews and her voluminous non-fiction.\"\n\nIn The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden, written in 1968, David W. Noble argued that the Adam figure had been \"the central myth in the American novel since 1830\".The full title of Noble's book is The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden: The Central Myth in the American Novel since 1830. As examples, he cites the works of Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Hemingway, and Faulkner.\n\nMythical themes and types\n\nAscending the mountain\n\nAccording to Lorena Laura Stookey, many myths feature sacred mountains as \"the sites of revelations\": \"In myth, the ascent of the holy mountain is a spiritual journey, promising purification, insight, wisdom, or knowledge of the sacred\".Stookey 164 As examples of this theme, Stookey includes the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, Christ's ascent of a mountain to deliver his Sermon on the Mount, and Christ's ascension into Heaven from the Mount of Olives.\n\nAxis mundi\n\nMany mythologies involve a \"world center\", which is often the sacred place of creation; this center often takes the form of a tree, mountain, or other upright object, which serves as an axis mundi or axle of the world.Leeming, Creation Myths of the World, 307Eliade, Cosmos and History, 12Every 51 A number of scholars have connected the Christian story of the crucifixion at Golgotha with this theme of a cosmic center. In his Creation Myths of the World, David Leeming argues that, in the Christian story of the crucifixion, the cross serves as \"the axis mundi, the center of a new creation\".\n\nAccording to a tradition preserved in Eastern Christian folklore, Golgotha was the summit of the cosmic mountain at the center of the world and the location where Adam had been both created and buried. According to this tradition, when Christ is crucified, his blood falls on Adam's skull, buried at the foot of the cross, and redeems him.Eliade, Myth and Reality, 14 George Every discusses the connection between the cosmic center and Golgotha in his book Christian Mythology, noting that the image of Adam's skull beneath the cross appears in many medieval representations of the crucifixion.\n\nIn Creation Myths of the World, Leeming suggests that the Garden of Eden may also be considered a world center.\n\nCombat myth\n\nMany Near Eastern religions include a story about a battle between a divine being and a dragon or other monster representing chaos—a theme found, for example, in the Enuma Elish. A number of scholars call this story the \"combat myth\".McGinn 22Forsyth 126Murphy 279 A number of scholars have argued that the ancient Israelites incorporated the combat myth into their religious imagery, such as the figures of Leviathan and Rahab,McGinn 24Murphy 281-82 the Song of the Sea, Isaiah 51:9-10's description of God's deliverance of his people from Babylon, and the portrayals of enemies such as Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar.Murphy 281 The idea of Satan as God's opponent may have developed under the influence of the combat myth.Forsyth 124 Scholars have also suggested that the Book of Revelation uses combat myth imagery in its descriptions of cosmic conflict.McGinn 57\n\nDescent to the underworld\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, Christ descended to hell after his death, in order to free the souls there; this event is known as the Harrowing of Hell. This story is narrated in the Gospel of Nicodemus and may be the meaning behind 1 Peter 3:18-22.Every 65-66Every also sees New Testament references to the general resurrection (e.g. in John 5:25-29) as connected with the harrowing of hell, because he believes that early Christianity did not distinguish clearly between the Christ's liberation of souls from hell and the general resurrection (Every 66). According to David Leeming, writing in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, the harrowing of hell is an example of the motif of the hero's descent to the underworld, which is common in many mythologies.\n\nDying god\n\nMany myths, particularly from the Near East, feature a god who dies and is resurrected; this figure is sometimes called the \"dying god\".Burkert 99Stookey 99 An important study of this figure is James George Frazer's The Golden Bough, which traces the dying god theme through a large number of myths.Miles 193-94 The dying god is often associated with fertility.Stookey 107 A number of scholars, including Frazer,Miles 194 have suggested that the Christ story is an example of the \"dying god\" theme.Sowa 351 In the article \"Dying god\" in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming notes that Christ can be seen as bringing fertility, though of a spiritual as opposed to physical kind.\n\nIn his 2006 homily for Corpus Christi, Pope Benedict XVI noted the similarity between the Christian story of the resurrection and pagan myths of dead and resurrected gods: \"In these myths, the soul of the human person, in a certain way, reached out toward that God made man, who, humiliated unto death on a cross, in this way opened the door of life to all of us.\"[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2006/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20060615_corpus-christi.html HOMILY OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI Saint John Lateran Thursday, 15 June 2006]\n\nFlood myths\n\nMany cultures have myths about a flood that cleanses the world in preparation for rebirth.Leeming, \"Flood\"Stookey 53 Such stories appear on every inhabited continent on earth. An example is the biblical story of Noah.Stookey 55 In The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming notes that, in the Bible story, as in other flood myths, the flood marks a new beginning and a second chance for creation and humanity.\n\nFounding myths\n\nAccording to Sandra Frankiel, the records of \"Jesus' life and death, his acts and words\" provide the \"founding myths\" of Christianity.Frankiel 57 Frankiel claims that these founding myths are \"structurally equivalent\" to the creation myths in other religions, because they are \"the pivot around which the religion turns to and which it returns\", establishing the \"meaning\" of the religion and the \"essential Christian practices and attitudes\". Tom Cain uses the expression \"founding myths\" more broadly, to encompass such stories as those of the War in Heaven and the fall of man; according to Cain, \"the disastrous consequences of disobedience\" is a pervasive theme in Christian founding myths.Cain 84\n\nHero myths\n\nIn his influential 1909 work Der Mythus von der Geburt des Helden (The Myth of the Birth of the Hero), Otto Rank argued that the births of many mythical heroes follow a common pattern. Rank includes the story of Christ's birth as a representative example of this pattern.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, one pervasive mythical theme associates heroes with the slaying of dragons, a theme which Eliade traces back to \"the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a divine hero and a dragon. He cites the Christian legend of Saint George as an example of this theme.Eliade, Cosmos and History, 39 An example from the later Middle Ages comes from Dieudonné de Gozon, third Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, famous for slaying the dragon of Malpasso. Eliade writes:\n\n\"Legend, as was natural, bestowed upon him the attributes of St. George, famed for his victorious fight with the monster. […] In other words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero, de Gozon was identified with a category, an archetype, which […] equipped him with a mythical biography from which it was impossible to omit combat with a reptilian monster.\"\n\nIn the Oxford Companion to World Mythology David Leeming lists Moses, Jesus, and King Arthur as examples of the \"heroic monomyth\",Leeming, \"Heroic monomyth\" calling the Christ story \"a particularly complete example of the heroic monomyth\". Leeming regards resurrection as a common part of the heroic monomyth,Leeming, \"Resurrection\" in which the resurrected heroes often become sources of \"material or spiritual food for their people\"; in this connection, Leeming notes that Christians regard Jesus as the \"bread of life\".\n\nIn terms of values, Leeming contrasts \"the myth of Jesus\" with the myths of other \"Christian heroes such as St. George, Roland, el Cid, and even King Arthur\"; the later hero myths, Leeming argues, reflect the survival of pre-Christian heroic values—\"values of military dominance and cultural differentiation and hegemony\"—more than the values expressed in the Christ story.\n\nParadise\n\nMany religious and mythological systems contain myths about a paradise. Many of these myths involve the loss of a paradise that existed at the beginning of the world. Some scholars have seen in the story of the Garden of Eden an instance of this general motif.Leeming, \"Paradise myths\"Stookey 5, 91\n\nSacrifice\n\nSacrifice is an element in many religious traditions and often represented in myths. In The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming lists the story of Abraham and Isaac and the story of Christ's death as examples of this theme.Leeming, \"Sacrifice\" Wendy Doniger describes the gospel accounts as a \"meta-myth\" in which Jesus realizes that he is part of a \"new myth [...] of a man who is sacrificed in hate\" but \"sees the inner myth, the old myth of origins and acceptance, the myth of a god who sacrifices himself in love\".Doniger 112\n\nAttitudes toward time\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, many traditional societies have a cyclic sense of time, periodically reenacting mythical events.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 72-73 Through this reenactment, these societies achieve an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age.Wendy Doniger, Forward to Eliade, Shamanism, xiii According to Eliade, Christianity retains a sense of cyclical time, through the ritual commemoration of Christ's life and the imitation of Christ's actions; Eliade calls this sense of cyclical time a \"mythical aspect\" of Christianity.Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 78\n\nHowever, Judeo-Christian thought also makes an \"innovation of the first importance\", Eliade says, because it embraces the notion of linear, historical time; in Christianity, \"time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time\".Eliade, Myth and Reality, 65. See also Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols, vol. 1, 79 Summarizing Eliade's statements on this subject, Eric Rust writes, \"A new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam—history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. [...] The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.\"Rust 60\n\nHeinrich Zimmer also notes Christianity's emphasis on linear time; he attributes this emphasis specifically to the influence of Saint Augustine's theory of history.Zimmer 19 Zimmer does not explicitly describe the cyclical conception of time as itself \"mythical\" per se, although he notes that this conception \"underl[ies] Hindu mythology\".Zimmmer 20\n\nNeil Forsyth writes that \"what distinguishes both Jewish and Christian religious systems [...] is that they elevate to the sacred status of myth narratives that are situated in historical time\".Forsyth 9\n\nLegacy\n\nConcepts of progress\n\nAccording to Carl Mitcham, \"the Christian mythology of progress toward transcendent salvation\" created the conditions for modern ideas of scientific and technological progress.Mitcham, in Davison 70 Hayden White describes \"the myth of Progress\" as the \"secular, Enlightenment counterpart\" of \"Christian myth\".White 65 Reinhold Niebuhr described the modern idea of ethical and scientific progress as \"really a rationalized version of the Christian myth of salvation\".Naveh 42\n\nPolitical and philosophical ideas\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the medieval \"Gioacchinian myth [...] of universal renovation in a more or less imminent future\" has influenced a number of modern theories of history, such as those of Lessing (who explicitly compares his views to those of medieval \"enthusiasts\"), Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling; and has also influenced a number of Russian writers.\n\nCalling Marxism \"a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology\", Eliade writes that Marxism \"takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the proletariat), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world\".Eliade, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, in Ellwood 91–92\n\nIn his article \"The Christian Mythology of Socialism\", Will Herberg argues that socialism inherits the structure of its ideology from the influence of Christian mythology upon western thought.Herberg 131\n\nIn The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, David Leeming claims that Judeo-Christian messianic ideas have influenced 20th-century totalitarian systems, citing the state ideology of the Soviet Union as an example.Leeming, \"Religion and myth\"\n\nAccording to Hugh S. Pyper, the biblical \"founding myths of the Exodus and the exile, read as stories in which a nation is forged by maintaining its ideological and racial purity in the face of an oppressive great power\", entered \"the rhetoric of nationalism throughout European history\", especially in Protestant countries and smaller nations.Pyper 333\n\nChristmas stories in popular culture\n\nSee Secular Christmas stories, Christmas in the media, and Christmas in literature.
