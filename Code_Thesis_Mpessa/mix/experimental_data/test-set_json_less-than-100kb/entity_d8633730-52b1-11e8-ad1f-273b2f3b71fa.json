  "textBody" : "A century (from the Latin centum, meaning one hundred; abbreviated c.) is a period of 100 years. Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages.  For example, \"the 17th century\" strictly refers to the years from 1601 to 1700, but popularly refers to be the years 1600 to 1699.\n\nA centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.\n\nStart and end in the Gregorian calendar \n\nAccording to the strict construction of the Gregorian calendar, the 1st century AD/CE started on January 1, 1, and ended on December 31, 100. The 2nd century started at year 101, the 3rd at 201, etc. The n-th century started/will start on the year (100 × n) − 99 and ends in 100 × n. Because of this, a century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. 1900 was the last year of the 19th century). \n\nPopularly speaking, a new century is calculated to begin in years ending with '00' and end with years ending in '99', whereas strict usage designates the '00' year as the last year of the century, and begins in years ending with '01'. For example, the 21st century strictly began on January 1, 2001 but popularly began on January 1, 2000.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/century\n\nViewpoint 1: Strict Usage\n\nViewpoint 2: Popular usage\n\n1st century BC and AD \n\nThere is no \"zeroth century\" in between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD. Also, there is no year 0 AD.Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the astronomical system and the ISO 8601 standard do use a year zero. The year 1 BC (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires usage of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow usage of the Julian calendar for dates before 1582 AD. The Julian calendar \"jumps\" from 1 BC to 1 AD. The first century BC includes the years 100 BC to 1 BC. Other centuries BC follow the same pattern.\n\nDating units in other calendar systems \n\nBesides the Gregorian calendar, the Julian calendar, the Aztec calendar, and the Hindu calendar have cycles of years that are used to delineate whole time periods; the Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60, while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52.\n\nCenturies in astronomical year numbering \n\nThe Astronomical year numbering, used by astronomers, includes a year zero (0). Consequently, the 1st century in these calendars may designate the years 0 to 99 as the 1st century, years 100 to 199 as the second, etc.https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html\n\nAlternative naming systems \n\nIn Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish, besides the ordinal naming of centuries another system is often used based on the hundreds part of the year, and consequently centuries start at even multiples of 100. For example, Swedish nittonhundratalet (or 1900-talet), Danish nittenhundredetallet (or 1900-tallet), Norwegian nittenhundretallet (or  1900-tallet) and Finnish tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku (or 1900-luku) refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999.\n\nThe same system is used informally in English. For example, the years 1900–1999 are referred to as the nineteen hundreds (1900s) four digits begging with a 19. This is similar to the English decade names (1980s, meaning the years 1980–1989) two digits begging with a 8.",
