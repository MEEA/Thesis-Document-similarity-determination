  "textBody" : "Concubinage is an interpersonal and sexual relationship in which the couple are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious prohibitions, professional ones (for example Roman soldiers) or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities. The woman in such a relationship is referred to as a concubine.\n\nThe prevalence of concubinage and the status of rights and expectations of a concubine have varied among cultures, as have the rights of children of a concubine. Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. Historically, concubinage was frequently entered into voluntarily (by the woman or her family) as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman involved. Involuntary or servile concubinage sometimes involved sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, usually the woman. Nevertheless, sexual relations outside marriage were not uncommon, especially among royalty and nobility, and the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a mistress. However, the children of such relationships were counted as illegitimate and were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even when there was an absence of any legitimate heirs.\n\nWhile various forms of long-term sexual relationships and co-habitation short of marriage have become increasingly common in the Western world, these are generally not described as concubinage. The terms concubinage and concubine are used today primarily when referring to non-marital partnerships of earlier eras. In modern usage, a non-marital domestic relationship is commonly referred to as co-habitation (or similar terms), and the woman in such a relationship is generally referred to as a girlfriend, mistress, fiancé, lover or life partner.\n\nIn Asia\n\nConcubinage was highly popular before early 20th century all over Asia. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by Dishu system.\n\nChina\n\nIn China, successful men often had concubines until the practice was outlawed after the Communist Party of China came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was qiè 妾, a term used since ancient times, which means \"female slave\". Concubines resembled wives () in that they were recognized sexual partners of a male family member and were expected to bear children from him. Unofficial concubines (), are of lower status, and children of her are considered illegitimate. In English the term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as pínfēi () \"consorts of emperors\", some of very high rank.Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): Women and the Family in Chinese History. Oxford: Routledge, p. 39.\n\nIn premodern China, it was illegal and socially disreputable for a man to have more than one wife at a time, but he could have concubines.Ebrey 2002:39. At first a man could have as many concubines as he could afford, however, from the Eastern Han (AD 25–220) onward, the maximal number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher ranking and the more noble an identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.Shi Fengyi 史凤仪 (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating 中国古代婚姻与家庭 Marriage and Family in ancient China. Wuhan: Hubei Renmin Chubanshe, p. 74.\n\nA concubine's treatment and situation were highly variable and were influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was engaged, as well as the attitude of the wife. In the Book of Rites chapter on “The Pattern of the Family” () it says: “If there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.” Besides, wives were married with dowries but concubines were not. Concubines could be taken without any of the ceremonies used in marriages. And neither remarriage nor a return to her natal home in widowhood were allowed.Ebrey 2002: 60.\n\nThe position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to wife's children but were still better than illegitimate children. And the child of a concubine had to show filial duty to two women, their biological mother and legal mother–the wife of their father.Ebrey 2002: 54. After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine's grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather’s wife.Ebrey 2002: 42.\n\nIn ancient times, concubines were allegedly buried alive with their masters to \"keep them company in the afterlife\". Until the Song dynasty (960–1276), it was treated as a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife. During the Qing China (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. Tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, had different ranks and were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. In Ming China (1368-1644), there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition would all be taken as selection criteria.Qiu Zhonglin(Chung-lin Ch'iu)邱仲麟:\"Mingdai linxuan Houfei jiqi guizhi\" 明代遴選後妃及其規制(The Imperial Concubine Selection System during the Ming Dynasty). Mingdai Yanjiu 明代研究(Ming Studies) 11.2008:58.\n\nDespite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples of concubines who achieved great power and influence in history and literature. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China's history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the Xianfeng Emperor, and gave birth to his only surviving son, who would become the Tongzhi Emperor. She would eventually become the de facto ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband's death.\n\nA display of concubinage is in one of the Four Great Classical Novels, Dream of the Red Chamber (believed to be a semi-autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin's own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one notable concubine of the emperor, Jia Yuanchun, the full elder sister of the male protagonist Jia Baoyu. In contrast, their younger half-siblings by Concubine Zhao, Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, developed distorted personalities, being children of concubine. Tanchun insisted that the brother of her father's wife Madam Wang, instead of the brother of Concubine Zhao is her uncle, and strive to be excellent in the girls to overcome her inferiority. Wang Xifeng stated that occasionally nobles seeking marriage would value the bride from her Dishu (being born by wife or concubine) status. Jia Baoyu himself has an unofficial concubine Hua Xiren, whom he had first sexual encounter with, but remain deep spiritual love to his cousin Lin Daiyu and intend to marry her.\n\nContemporary China\n\nThe concept of men having relationships with one or more concubines has seen a comeback since modern China has prospered. Mistresses are often viewed as concubines, inferior to the wife in status.\n\nThe women called er nai, unofficial concubines in the 21st century, typically say they feel fine about exploiting their youth, beauty and wombs for the sake of earning money and protection from their men, and not having to live with the primary wives any more as in the past. The one-child policy in Mainland China also pushed those men with power and wealth to pursue a male heir.\n\nEmperors' concubines and harems are emphasized in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers and set in ancient times. As a plot element, the children of concubines are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history. The zhai dou (residential intrigue) and gong dou (harem intrigue) genres show concubines and wives, as well as their children, scheming secretly to access power. Empresses in the Palace, a gong dou type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China.\n\nHong Kong, Macau\n\nHong Kong officially abolished the Great Qing Legal Code in 1971, which makes concubinage illegal. Stanley Ho of Macau took his \"2nd wife\" as his official concubine in 1957, and his \"3rd and 4th wife\" retain no official status.\n\nJapan\n\nBefore the Meiji period, when monogamy was not legally adopted, concubinage was common among the nobility. The purpose of concubinage was mainly for the production of male heirs, as well as for the sexual pleasure for males. In the Imperial House of Japan the son of a concubine often had a chance at being an emperor. Yanagihara Naruko, a high rank concubine of Emperor Meiji, gave birth to Emperor Taishō, who was later legally adopted by the wife of Emperor Meiji, Empress Haruko.\n\nEven in merchant families, concubinage was occasionally used to produce heirs. Asako Hirooka, a female entrepreneur born as a concubine's daughter, who had worked hard to let her husband's family survive after the Meiji Restoration, lost her fertility after giving birth to her only daughter Kameko. Despite that, she and her husband got along well, her husband had to take Asako's maid servant as his concubine, fathered three daughters and an only son with her. Kameko herself, as the child of wife, still married a noble man matrilineally and carried on the family name.\n\nKorea\n\nJoseon monarchs also have a harem which contains concubines of different ranks. Empress Myeongseong managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\nChildren of concubines often have lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine cannot be the wife of a wife-born son of the same class. For example, Jang Nok-su is a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, later a high-rank concubine of Yeonsangun.\n\nThailand\n\nBefore 1935, the family law listed three kind of wives - official wife, minor wife and slave wife.\n\nGreco-Roman Antiquity\n\nAncient Greece\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the practice of keeping a slave concubine ( pallakís) was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history. The law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught attempting a relationship with his concubine for the production of free children, which suggests that a concubine's children were not granted citizenship. While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife. Some interpretations of hetaera have held they were concubines when they had a permanent relationship with a single man.\n\nAncient Roman concubinae and concubini\n\nConcubinage was an institution practiced in ancient Rome that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (concubina, plural concubinae) who was not his wife, most often a woman whose lower social status was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was \"tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family\".Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111. It was not considered derogatory to be called a concubina, as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.\n\nA concubinus was a young male slave sexually exploited by his master as a sexual partner (see homosexuality in ancient Rome). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role to marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household (pater familias). In one of his epithalamiums, Catullus (fl. mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a concubinus who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.Catullus, Carmen 61; Amy Richlin, \"Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men\", Journal of the History of Sexuality 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.\n\nIn Abrahamic traditions\n\nIn Judaism \n\nAmong the Israelites, men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.\n\nIn ancient Judaism\n\nThe concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the Levitical rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as \"wife\" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means \"concubine\". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife. In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved. Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of Sarah and Hagar, and Rachel and Bilhah. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife; for example, King Abimelech was the son of Gideon and his concubine. Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and Solomon had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the Books of Kings say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.\n\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19–20,  shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of Kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a civil war. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to make her fall in love with him again at her father’s house; he brought a servant and two asses to show off what glory he has. Her father seeks to keep him there until one day he refuses to remain and leaves. hospitality he is offered at Gibeah, the way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure.The Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womrmfolk, both the host’s virgin daughter and his companion’s concubine, to their aggressors for sex, in exchange for their own safety. In the morning, the Levite tries to wake her up, but then realizes that she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel to remind them of the blessing that God gave them of liberating them from the likewise sexually vicious and sadistic land of Egypt, and to inform them of the horribleness of the land of Gibeah. The sadistic rape of the concubine is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjamites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in forced marriage to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjamite survivors who still have no wives are granted a mass marriage by abduction by the other tribes.\n\nIn modern Judaism\n\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term pilegesh (). The term is a loanword from Ancient Greek ,Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002 meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a ketubah and her marriage (nissu'in) was preceded by an erusin (\"formal betrothal\"). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud argues that the concubine should also receive a marriage contract, but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.\n\nCertain Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, believed that concubines were strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of sexual relations outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, Leviticus Rabbah severely condemns the custom.Leviticus Rabbah, 25 Other Jewish thinkers, such as Nahmanides, Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus, and Jacob Emden, strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the Hebrew of the contemporary State of Israel, pilegesh is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"mistress\"—i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations—regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise pilegesh as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by Jewish law).Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", New York Jewish Week, December 2006[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"], The Independent, London 20 October 1996\n\nIn Islam\n\nSexual slavery as concubinage in Islamic sexual jurisprudence is permitted in Islam which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the Arab slave trade throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period, when women and girls from the Caucasus, Africa, Central Asia and Europe were captured and served as concubines in the harems of the Arab World. Ibn Battuta tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] . San Francisco Unified School District. \n\nConcubinage is permitted and regulated in Islam. Al-Muminun 6 and Al-Maarij 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \"those whom one's right hands possess\" (concubine/sexual slaves), saying \" أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ\" (literally, \"their spouses or what their right hands possess\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi explains that \"two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession\". \"Concubine\" (surriyya) refers to the female slave (jāriya), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word \"surriyya\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression \"Ma malakat aymanukum\" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines. Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom. Rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that \"it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.\" p.22 Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master p.48  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, \"in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests.\" \nConcubines were common in pre-Islamic Arabia and when Islam arrived, it had a society with concubines. Islam introduced legal restrictions to the concubinage\n[http://www.islamicstudies.info/quran/maarif/maarif.php?sura4&verse\n22 Maarif ul Quran] and encouraged manumission. In verse 23:6 in the Quran it is allowed to have sexual intercourse with concubines after marrying them, as Islam forbids sexual intercourse outside of marriage.\nChildren of former concubines were generally declared as legitimate as they were born in wedlock, and the mother of a free child was considered free upon the death of the male partner.\n\nAccording to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned Nikah mut‘ah (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution. Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to differentiate between marriage (nikah) and Mut'ah, and states that while nikah is for procreation, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification. According to Zeyno Baran, this kind of temporary marriage provides Shi'ite men with a religiously sanctioned equivalent to prostitution.  According to Elena Andreeva's observation published in 2007, Russian travellers to Iran consider mut'ah to be \"legalized profligacy\" which is indistinguishable from prostitution.Andreeva, Elena (2007). Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162–163. . \"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution.\" Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of iddah in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6n9L616bI Permanent archived link].\n\nPre-modern times\n\nIn ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the Battle of the Trench,Majlisi, M. B. (1966). Hayat-ul-Qaloob, Volume 2, Translated by Molvi Syed Basharat Hussain Sahib Kamil, Imamia Kutub Khana, Lahore, Pakistan or in numerous later Caliphates.Murat Iyigun, “Lessons From the Ottoman Harem on Culture, Religion & Wars”, University of Colorado, 2011\nIt was encouraged to manumit slave women who rejected their initial faith and embraced Islam, or to bring them into formal marriage.\n\nModern times\n\nAccording to the rules of Islamic Fiqh, what is halal (permitted) by Allah in the Quran cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the concept of concubinage is halal, concubines are mostly no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, a concubine in this modern era, if existing,  must be given all the due rights that Islam had preserved in the past.\n\nIt is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikah (formal marriage) or Nikah mut‘ahMotahhari M. [http://www.al-islam.org/rightsofwomeninislam/7.htm \"The rights of woman in Islam, fixed-term marriage and the problem of the harem\"]. Al-islam.org website. Accessed 15 March 2014. (temporary marriage which only Shi'ah Islam permits; some Sunni Muslims practice Nikah Misyar, or \"traveller's marriage\") is committed through the proper channels.\n\nIn the United States\n\nWhen slavery became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines. Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against miscegenation, or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery, 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17 This led to generations of multiracial slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the American Civil War.\n\nIn some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital.  A purported relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings is an example of this.[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: \"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings ... Since then, a committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, after reviewing essentially the same material, reached different conclusions, namely that Sally Hemings was only a minor figure in Thomas Jefferson's life and that it is very unlikely he fathered any of her children. This committee also suggested in its report, issued in April 2001 and revised in 2011, that Jefferson's younger brother Randolph (1755-1815) was more likely the father of at least some of Sally Hemings's children.\"   Such arrangements were more prevalent in the Southern states during the antebellum years.\n\nPlaçage\n\nIn Louisiana and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called plaçage developed. European men took enslaved or free women of color as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html Helen Bush Caver and Mary T.

After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine's grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather’s wife.Ebrey 2002: 42.\n\nIn ancient times, concubines were allegedly buried alive with their masters to \"keep them company in the afterlife\". Until the Song dynasty (960–1276), it was treated as a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife. During the Qing China (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. Tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, had different ranks and were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. In Ming China (1368-1644), there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition would all be taken as selection criteria.Qiu Zhonglin(Chung-lin Ch'iu)邱仲麟:\"Mingdai linxuan Houfei jiqi guizhi\" 明代遴選後妃及其規制(The Imperial Concubine Selection System during the Ming Dynasty). Mingdai Yanjiu 明代研究(Ming Studies) 11.2008:58.\n\nDespite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples of concubines who achieved great power and influence in history and literature. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China's history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the Xianfeng Emperor, and gave birth to his only surviving son, who would become the Tongzhi Emperor. She would eventually become the de facto ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband's death.\n\nA display of concubinage is in one of the Four Great Classical Novels, Dream of the Red Chamber (believed to be a semi-autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin's own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one notable concubine of the emperor, Jia Yuanchun, the full elder sister of the male protagonist Jia Baoyu. In contrast, their younger half-siblings by Concubine Zhao, Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, developed distorted personalities, being children of concubine. Tanchun insisted that the brother of her father's wife Madam Wang, instead of the brother of Concubine Zhao is her uncle, and strive to be excellent in the girls to overcome her inferiority. Wang Xifeng stated that occasionally nobles seeking marriage would value the bride from her Dishu (being born by wife or concubine) status. Jia Baoyu himself has an unofficial concubine Hua Xiren, whom he had first sexual encounter with, but remain deep spiritual love to his cousin Lin Daiyu and intend to marry her.\n\nContemporary China\n\nThe concept of men having relationships with one or more concubines has seen a comeback since modern China has prospered. Mistresses are often viewed as concubines, inferior to the wife in status.\n\nThe women called er nai, unofficial concubines in the 21st century, typically say they feel fine about exploiting their youth, beauty and wombs for the sake of earning money and protection from their men, and not having to live with the primary wives any more as in the past. The one-child policy in Mainland China also pushed those men with power and wealth to pursue a male heir.\n\nEmperors' concubines and harems are emphasized in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers and set in ancient times. As a plot element, the children of concubines are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history. The zhai dou (residential intrigue) and gong dou (harem intrigue) genres show concubines and wives, as well as their children, scheming secretly to access power. Empresses in the Palace, a gong dou type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China.\n\nHong Kong, Macau\n\nHong Kong officially abolished the Great Qing Legal Code in 1971, which makes concubinage illegal. Stanley Ho of Macau took his \"2nd wife\" as his official concubine in 1957, and his \"3rd and 4th wife\" retain no official status.\n\nJapan\n\nBefore the Meiji period, when monogamy was not legally adopted, concubinage was common among the nobility. The purpose of concubinage was mainly for the production of male heirs, as well as for the sexual pleasure for males. In the Imperial House of Japan the son of a concubine often had a chance at being an emperor. Yanagihara Naruko, a high rank concubine of Emperor Meiji, gave birth to Emperor Taishō, who was later legally adopted by the wife of Emperor Meiji, Empress Haruko.\n\nEven in merchant families, concubinage was occasionally used to produce heirs. Asako Hirooka, a female entrepreneur born as a concubine's daughter, who had worked hard to let her husband's family survive after the Meiji Restoration, lost her fertility after giving birth to her only daughter Kameko. Despite that, she and her husband got along well, her husband had to take Asako's maid servant as his concubine, fathered three daughters and an only son with her. Kameko herself, as the child of wife, still married a noble man matrilineally and carried on the family name.\n\nKorea\n\nJoseon monarchs also have a harem which contains concubines of different ranks. Empress Myeongseong managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\nChildren of concubines often have lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine cannot be the wife of a wife-born son of the same class. For example, Jang Nok-su is a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, later a high-rank concubine of Yeonsangun.\n\nThailand\n\nBefore 1935, the family law listed three kind of wives - official wife, minor wife and slave wife.\n\nGreco-Roman Antiquity\n\nAncient Greece\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the practice of keeping a slave concubine ( pallakís) was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history. The law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught attempting a relationship with his concubine for the production of free children, which suggests that a concubine's children were not granted citizenship. While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife. Some interpretations of hetaera have held they were concubines when they had a permanent relationship with a single man.\n\nAncient Roman concubinae and concubini\n\nConcubinage was an institution practiced in ancient Rome that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (concubina, plural concubinae) who was not his wife, most often a woman whose lower social status was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was \"tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family\".Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111. It was not considered derogatory to be called a concubina, as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.\n\nA concubinus was a young male slave sexually exploited by his master as a sexual partner (see homosexuality in ancient Rome). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role to marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household (pater familias). In one of his epithalamiums, Catullus (fl. mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a concubinus who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.Catullus, Carmen 61; Amy Richlin, \"Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men\", Journal of the History of Sexuality 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.\n\nIn Abrahamic traditions\n\nIn Judaism \n\nAmong the Israelites, men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.\n\nIn ancient Judaism\n\nThe concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the Levitical rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as \"wife\" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means \"concubine\". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife. In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved. Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of Sarah and Hagar, and Rachel and Bilhah. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife; for example, King Abimelech was the son of Gideon and his concubine. Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and Solomon had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the Books of Kings say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.\n\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19–20,  shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of Kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a civil war. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to make her fall in love with him again at her father’s house; he brought a servant and two asses to show off what glory he has. Her father seeks to keep him there until one day he refuses to remain and leaves. hospitality he is offered at Gibeah, the way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure.The Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womrmfolk, both the host’s virgin daughter and his companion’s concubine, to their aggressors for sex, in exchange for their own safety. In the morning, the Levite tries to wake her up, but then realizes that she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel to remind them of the blessing that God gave them of liberating them from the likewise sexually vicious and sadistic land of Egypt, and to inform them of the horribleness of the land of Gibeah. The sadistic rape of the concubine is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjamites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in forced marriage to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjamite survivors who still have no wives are granted a mass marriage by abduction by the other tribes.\n\nIn modern Judaism\n\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term pilegesh (). The term is a loanword from Ancient Greek ,Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002 meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a ketubah and her marriage (nissu'in) was preceded by an erusin (\"formal betrothal\"). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud argues that the concubine should also receive a marriage contract, but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.\n\nCertain Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, believed that concubines were strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of sexual relations outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, Leviticus Rabbah severely condemns the custom.Leviticus Rabbah, 25 Other Jewish thinkers, such as Nahmanides, Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus, and Jacob Emden, strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the Hebrew of the contemporary State of Israel, pilegesh is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"mistress\"—i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations—regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise pilegesh as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by Jewish law).Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", New York Jewish Week, December 2006[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"], The Independent, London 20 October 1996\n\nIn Islam\n\nSexual slavery as concubinage in Islamic sexual jurisprudence is permitted in Islam which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the Arab slave trade throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period, when women and girls from the Caucasus, Africa, Central Asia and Europe were captured and served as concubines in the harems of the Arab World. Ibn Battuta tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] . San Francisco Unified School District. \n\nConcubinage is permitted and regulated in Islam. Al-Muminun 6 and Al-Maarij 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \"those whom one's right hands possess\" (concubine/sexual slaves), saying \" أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ\" (literally, \"their spouses or what their right hands possess\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi explains that \"two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession\". \"Concubine\" (surriyya) refers to the female slave (jāriya), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word \"surriyya\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression \"Ma malakat aymanukum\" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines. Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom. Rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that \"it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.\" p.22 Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master p.48  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, \"in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests.\" \nConcubines were common in pre-Islamic Arabia and when Islam arrived, it had a society with concubines. Islam introduced legal restrictions to the concubinage\n[http://www.islamicstudies.info/quran/maarif/maarif.php?sura4&verse\n22 Maarif ul Quran] and encouraged manumission. In verse 23:6 in the Quran it is allowed to have sexual intercourse with concubines after marrying them, as Islam forbids sexual intercourse outside of marriage.\nChildren of former concubines were generally declared as legitimate as they were born in wedlock, and the mother of a free child was considered free upon the death of the male partner.\n\nAccording to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned Nikah mut‘ah (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution. Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to differentiate between marriage (nikah) and Mut'ah, and states that while nikah is for procreation, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification. According to Zeyno Baran, this kind of temporary marriage provides Shi'ite men with a religiously sanctioned equivalent to prostitution.  According to Elena Andreeva's observation published in 2007, Russian travellers to Iran consider mut'ah to be \"legalized profligacy\" which is indistinguishable from prostitution.Andreeva, Elena (2007). Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162–163. . \"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution.\" Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of iddah in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6n9L616bI Permanent archived link].\n\nPre-modern times\n\nIn ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the Battle of the Trench,Majlisi, M. B. (1966). Hayat-ul-Qaloob, Volume 2, Translated by Molvi Syed Basharat Hussain Sahib Kamil, Imamia Kutub Khana, Lahore, Pakistan or in numerous later Caliphates.Murat Iyigun, “Lessons From the Ottoman Harem on Culture, Religion & Wars”, University of Colorado, 2011\nIt was encouraged to manumit slave women who rejected their initial faith and embraced Islam, or to bring them into formal marriage.\n\nModern times\n\nAccording to the rules of Islamic Fiqh, what is halal (permitted) by Allah in the Quran cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the concept of concubinage is halal, concubines are mostly no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, a concubine in this modern era, if existing,  must be given all the due rights that Islam had preserved in the past.\n\nIt is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikah (formal marriage) or Nikah mut‘ahMotahhari M. [http://www.al-islam.org/rightsofwomeninislam/7.htm \"The rights of woman in Islam, fixed-term marriage and the problem of the harem\"]. Al-islam.org website. Accessed 15 March 2014. (temporary marriage which only Shi'ah Islam permits; some Sunni Muslims practice Nikah Misyar, or \"traveller's marriage\") is committed through the proper channels.\n\nIn the United States\n\nWhen slavery became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines. Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against miscegenation, or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery, 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17 This led to generations of multiracial slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the American Civil War.\n\nIn some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital.  A purported relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings is an example of this.[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: \"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings ... Since then, a committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, after reviewing essentially the same material, reached different conclusions, namely that Sally Hemings was only a minor figure in Thomas Jefferson's life and that it is very unlikely he fathered any of her children. This committee also suggested in its report, issued in April 2001 and revised in 2011, that Jefferson's younger brother Randolph (1755-1815) was more likely the father of at least some of Sally Hemings's children.\"   Such arrangements were more prevalent in the Southern states during the antebellum years.\n\nPlaçage\n\nIn Louisiana and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called plaçage developed. European men took enslaved or free women of color as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html Helen Bush Caver and Mary T.
