  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a contraction mapping, or contraction or contractor, on a metric space (M,d) is a function f from M to itself, with the property that there is some nonnegative real number 0\\leq k  such that for all x and y in M,\nd(f(x),f(y))\\leq k\\,d(x,y).\nThe smallest such value of k is called the Lipschitz constant of f.  Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps.  If the above condition is instead satisfied for\nk ≤ 1, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map.\n\nMore generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (M,d) and (N,d) are two metric spaces, and f:M \\rightarrow N, then there is a constant k  such that\nd'(f(x),f(y))\\leq k\\,d(x,y)\nfor all x and y in M.\n\nEvery contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant k is no longer necessarily less than 1).\n\nA contraction mapping has at most one fixed point.
