  "textBody" : "Hermes (; ) is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology, the son of Zeus and the Pleiad Maia, and the second-youngest of the Olympian gods (Dionysus being the youngest).\n\nHermes was the emissary and messenger of the gods.Burkert, p. 158. Iris has a similar role as divine messenger. Hermes was also \"the divine trickster\"Burkert, p. 156. and \"the god of boundaries and the transgression of boundaries, ... the patron of herdsmen, thieves, graves, and heralds.\"Burkert, p. 158. He is described as moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and divine, and was the conductor of souls into the afterlife.Burkert, pp. 157–158. He was also viewed as the protector and patron of roads and travelers.Lay, [https://books.google.com/books?idBzNfeQSXKfcC&pg\nPA3 p. 3].\n\nIn some myths, he is a trickster and outwits other gods for his own satisfaction or for the sake of humankind. His attributes and symbols include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, winged sandals, and winged cap. His main symbol is the Greek kerykeion or Latin caduceus, which appears in a form of two snakes wrapped around a winged staff with carvings of the other gods.The Latin word ' is an adaptation of the Greek  ', meaning \"herald's wand (or staff)\", deriving from  ', meaning \"messenger, herald, envoy\". Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon; Stuart L. Tyson, \"The Caduceus\", The Scientific Monthly, 34.6 (1932:492–98), p. 493.\n\nIn the Roman adaptation of the Greek pantheon (see interpretatio romana), Hermes is identified with the Roman god Mercury,Bullfinch's Mythology (1978), Crown Publishers, p. 926. who, though inherited from the Etruscans, developed many similar characteristics such as being the patron of commerce.\n\nEtymology and origins\n\nThe earliest form of the name Hermes is the Mycenaean Greek *hermāhās, written  e-ma-a2 (e-ma-ha) in the Linear B syllabic script. Most scholars derive \"Hermes\" from Greek ἕρμα herma, \"prop,. heap of stones, boundary marker\", from which the word hermai (\"boundary markers dedicated to Hermes as a god of travelers\") also derives.. The etymology of ἕρμα itself is unknown, but it is probably not an Proto-Indo-European word. However, the stone etymology is also linked to Indo-European *ser- (“to bind, put together”). Scholarly speculation that \"Hermes\" derives from a more primitive form meaning \"one cairn\" is disputed.Davies, Anna Morpurgo & Duhoux, Yves. Linear B: a 1984 survey. Peeters Publishers, 1985, p. 136. In Greek, a lucky find is a ἕρμαιον hermaion.\n\nAccording to one theory that has received considerable scholarly acceptance, Hermes himself originated as a form of the god Pan, who has been identified as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European pastoral god *Péh2usōn,H. Collitz, \"Wodan, Hermes und Pushan,\" Festskrift tillägnad Hugo Pipping pȧ hans sextioȧrsdag den 5 November 1924 1924, pp 574–587. in his aspect as the god of boundary markers. Later, the epithet supplanted the original name itself and Hermes took over the roles as god of messengers, travelers, and boundaries, which had originally belonged to Pan, while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name in his more rustic aspect as the god of the wild in the relatively isolated mountainous region of Arcadia. In later myths, after the cult of Pan was reintroduced to Attica, Pan was said to be Hermes's son.\n\nOther origins have also been proposed. R. S. P. Beekes rejects the connection with herma and suggests a Pre-Greek origin. Other scholars have suggested that Hermes may be a cognate of the Vedic Sarama.Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology, ed. Félix Guirand & Robert Graves, Hamlyn, 1968, p. 123.\n\nMythology\n\nEarly Greek sources\n\nHomer and Hesiod\n\nHomer and Hesiod portrayed Hermes as the author of skilled or deceptive acts and also as a benefactor of mortals. In the Iliad, he is called \"the bringer of good luck\", \"guide and guardian\", and \"excellent in all the tricks\". He was a divine ally of the Greeks against the Trojans. However, he did protect Priam when he went to the Greek camp to retrieve the body of his son Hector and accompanied them back to Troy.Homer. The Iliad.  The Project Gutenberg Etext. Trans. Samuel Butler.\n\nHe also rescued Ares from a brazen vessel where he had been imprisoned by Otus and Ephialtes. In the Odyssey, Hermes helps his great-grand son, the protagonist Odysseus, by informing him about the fate of his companions, who were turned into animals by the power of Circe. Hermes instructed Odysseus to protect himself by chewing a magic herb; he also told Calypso of Zeus' order to free Odysseus from her island to allow him to continue his journey back home. When Odysseus killed the suitors of his wife, Hermes led their souls to Hades.Homer. The Odyssey. Plain Label Books, 1990. Trans. Samuel Butler. pp. 40, 81–82, 192–195. In The Works and Days, when Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora to disgrace humanity by punishing Prometheus's act of giving fire to man, every god gave her a gift, and Hermes' gifts were lies, seductive words, and a dubious character. Hermes was then instructed to take her as wife to Epimetheus.Hesiod.

Trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White, 1914.\n\nAthenian tragic playwrights\n\nAeschylus wrote in The Eumenides that Hermes helped Orestes kill Clytemnestra under a false identity and other stratagems, and also said that he was the god of searches, and those who seek things lost or stolen.Aeschylus, Suppliant Women 919.  Quoted in [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Travel God of Searchers]. The Theoi Project: Greek Mythology. In Philoctetes, Sophocles invokes Hermes when Odysseus needs to convince Philoctetes to join the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks, and in Euripides' Rhesus Hermes helps Dolon spy on the Greek navy.\n\nAesop\n\nAesop featured him in several of his fables, as ruler of the gate of prophetic dreams, as the god of athletes, of edible roots, and of hospitality. He also said that Hermes had assigned each person his share of intelligence.Aesop. Fables 474, 479, 520, 522, 563, 564.

Project Gutenberg. invokes him as the one \"of many shifts (polytropos), blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods.\"Hymn to Hermes 13. The word polutropos (\"of many shifts, turning many ways, of many devices, ingenious, or much wandering\") is also used to describe Odysseus in the first line of the Odyssey. Hermes, as an inventor of fire,In the Homeric hymn, \"after he had fed the loud-bellowing cattle... he gathered much wood and sought the craft of fire. He also invented written music and many other things. He took a splendid laurel branch, gripped it in his palm, and twirled it in pomegranate wood\" (lines 105, 108–10) is a parallel of the Titan Prometheus. In addition to the lyre, Hermes was believed to have invented many types of racing and the sports of wrestling and boxing, and therefore was a patron of athletes.\"First Inventors... Mercurius [Hermes] first taught wrestling to mortals.\" – Hyginus, Fabulae 277.\n\nTranslations\n\nIn 1820 Shelley translated this hymn.N Richardson, [https://books.google.com/books?idk0jtO6Zd5ikC&pg\nPT33&lpgPT33&dq\nShelley+translation+of+the+hymn+to+Hermes&sourcebl&ots\nw0Rdngbnxl&sigl7FNfF_BrsM8sApZhEpjzsNbTB4&hl\nen&saX&ei\noPMWVeNTic5o--KBiAM&ved0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v\nonepage&qShelley%20translation%20of%20the%20hymn%20to%20Hermes&f\nfalse The Homeric Hymns] (edited by J Cashford), Penguin UK, 2003, .\n\nH.

He participated in the Gigantomachy in defense of Olympus; was given the task of bringing baby Dionysus to be cared for by Ino and Athamas and later by nymphs of Asia, followed Hera, Athena and Aphrodite in a beauty contest; favored the young Hercules by giving him a sword when he finished his education and lent his sandals to Perseus.Pseudo-Apollodorus.

It is also possible that since the beginning he has been a deity with shamanic attributes linked to divination, reconciliation, magic, sacrifices, and initiation and contact with other planes of existence, a role of mediator between the worlds of the visible and invisible.Danubian Historical Studies, 2, Akadémiai Kiadó, 1988, p. 32.\n\nDuring the 3rd century BC, a communication between Petosiris (a priest) to King Nechopso, probably written in Alexandria c. 150 BC, states Hermes is the teacher of all secret wisdoms available to knowing by the experience of religious ecstasy.Jacobi, M.

Catholic Encyclopedia: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02018e.htm \"Astrology\"], New York: Robert Appleton Company.\n\nDue to his constant mobility, he was considered the god of commerce and social intercourse, the wealth brought in business, especially sudden or unexpected enrichment, travel, roads and crossroads, borders and boundary conditions or transient, the changes from the threshold, agreements and contracts, friendship, hospitality, sexual intercourse, games, data, the draw, good luck, the sacrifices and the sacrificial animals, flocks and shepherds and the fertility of land and cattle.

Tradition says that his first temple was built by Lycaon.  From there the cult would have been taken to Athens, and then radiated to the whole of Greece, according to Smith, and his temples and statues became extremely numerous. Lucian of Samosata said he saw the temples of Hermes everywhere.Lucian of Samosata. The Works of Lucian of Samosata.  BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008. Volume 1, p. 107.\n\nIn many places, temples were consecrated in conjunction with Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.\nAs a patron of the gym and fighting, Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the Olympic Games.  His statue was held there on an altar dedicated to him and Apollo together.Johnston, Sarah Iles. Initiation in Myth, Initiation in Practice. IN Dodd, David Brooks & Faraone, Christopher A.

However, Plato said that Socrates attended a Hermaea. Of all the festivals involving Greek games, these were the most like initiations because participation in them was restricted to young boys and excluded adults.Scanlon, Thomas Francis.

Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 92–93.\n\nHermai/Herms\n\nIn Ancient Greece, Hermes was a phallic god of boundaries. His name, in the form herma, was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones; each traveler added a stone to the pile. In the 6th century BC, Hipparchos, the son of Pisistratus, replaced the cairns that marked the midway point between each village deme at the central agora of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of Hermes with a beard. An erect phallus rose from the base. In the more primitive Mount Kyllini or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus. In Athens, herms were placed outside houses for good luck. \"That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an Olympian god is astounding,\" Walter Burkert remarked.Walter Burkert, 1985. Greek Religion (Harvard University Press)\n\nIn 415 BC, when the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War, all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized one night.  The Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or from the anti-war faction within Athens itself. Socrates' pupil Alcibiades was suspected of involvement, and Socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 6.27.\n\nHermes's possible offspring\n\nPan\n\nThe satyr-like Greek god of nature, shepherds and flocks, Pan, could possibly be the son of Hermes through the nymph Dryope.Hyginus, Fabula 160, makes Hermes the father of Pan. In the Homeric Hymn to Pan, Pan's mother fled in fright from her newborn son's goat-like appearance.\n\nPriapus\n\nDepending on the sources consulted, the god Priapus could be understood as a son of Hermes.Karl Kerényi, Gods of the Greeks, 1951, p. 175, citing G. Kaibel, Epigrammata graeca ex lapidibus collecta, 817, where the other god's name, both father and son of Hermes, is obscured; according to other sources, Priapus was a son of Dionysus and Aphrodite.\n\nAutolycus\n\nAutolycus, the Prince of Thieves, was a son of Hermes and Chione (mortal) and grandfather of Odysseus.Bibliotheca 1.9.16.\n\nExtended list of Hermes's lovers and children\n\n# Acacallis\n## Cydon\n# Aglaurus\n## Eumolpus\n# AmphionAs presumed by Philostratus the Elder in his Imagines, 1.10.\n# Alcidameia of Corinth\n## Bounos\n# Antianeira / Laothoe\n## Echion, Argonaut\n## Erytus, Argonaut\n# Apemosyne\n# Aphrodite\n## Hermaphroditus\n## Tyche (possibly)\n# Astabe, daughter of Peneus\n## Astacus\n# Carmentis\n## Evander\n# Chione / Stilbe / TelaugeEustathius on Homer, 804.\n## Autolycus\n# Chryses, priest of Apollo\n# Chthonophyle\n## Polybus of Sicyon\n# Crocus\n# Daeira the Oceanid\n## Eleusis\n# Dryope, Arcadian nymph\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Erytheia (daughter of Geryon)\n## NoraxPausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.17.5 10.17.5].\n# Eupolemeia (daughter of Myrmidon)\n## Aethalides\n# Hecate\n## three unnamed daughtersTzetzes on Lycophron, 680.\n# Herse\n## Cephalus\n## Ceryx (possibly)\n# Hiereia\n## GigasThis Gigas was the father of Ischenus, who was said to have been sacrificed during an outbreak of famine in Olympia; Tzetzes on Lycophron 42.\n# Iphthime (daughter of Dorus)\n## Lycus\n## Pherespondus\n## Pronomus\n# Libye (daughter of Palamedes)\n## LibysHyginus, Fabulae, 160.\n# Ocyrhoe\n## Caicus\n# OdrysusClement of Rome, Homilia, 5.16.\n# Orsinoe, nymphScholia on Euripides, Rhesus, 36.\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Palaestra, daughter of Choricus\n# Pandrosus\n## Ceryx (possibly)\n# Peitho\n# Penelope\n## Nomios\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Persephone (unsuccessfully wooed her)\n# PerseusPseudo-Hyginus, De Astronomica 2.12.\n# Phylodameia\n## Pharis\n# PolydeucesPtolemy Hephaestion, 6 in Photius, 190.\n# Polymele (daughter of Phylas)\n## Eudorus\n# Rhene, nymph\n## Saon of SamothraceSaon could also have been the son of Zeus and a local nymph; both versions in Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5.48.2.\n# Sicilian nymph\n## Daphnis\n# Sose, nymph\n## Agreus\n# Tanagra, daughter of Asopus\n# Theobula / Clytie / Clymene / Cleobule / Myrto / Phaethusa the Danaid\n## Myrtilus\n# ThersesClement of Rome, Homilia, 5.16; otherwise unknown.\n# Thronia\n## Arabus\n# Urania, Muse\n## Linus (possibly)\n# Unknown mothers\n## Abderus\n## Angelia\n## Dolops\n## Palaestra\n\nGenealogy\n\nArt and iconography\n\nThe image of Hermes evolved and varied according to Greek art and culture. During Archaic Greece he was usually depicted as a mature man, bearded, dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. During Classical and Hellenistic Greece he is usually depicted young and nude, with athleticism, as befits the god of speech and of the gymnastics, or a robe, a formula is set predominantly through the centuries.  When represented as Logios (Greek: Λόγιος, speaker), his attitude is consistent with the attribute. Phidias left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and Praxiteles another, also well known, showing him with the baby Dionysus in his arms. At all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods, Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all together.Müller, Karl Otfried. [https://books.google.com/books?id\noSsGAAAAQAAJ&printsecfrontcover&dq\nAncient+art+and+its+remains:+or,+A+manual+of+the+arch%C3%A6ology+of+art&hlen&ei\nMr-9TcWKK6Xr0gGGodCOAw&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n1&ved0CCoQ6AEwAA#v\nonepage&q&f=false Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the archæology of art]. B. Quaritch, 1852. pp. 483–488.\n\nAmong these objects is a wide-brimmed hat, the petasos, widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun, and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings; sometimes the hat is not present, and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair.  Another object is the Porta: a stick, called a rhabdomyolysis (stick) or skeptron (scepter), which is referred to as a magic wand. Some early sources say that this was the bat he received from Apollo, but others question the merits of this claim. It seems that there may have been two canes, one of a shepherd's staff, as stated in the Homeric Hymn, and the other a magic wand, according to some authors. His bat also came to be called kerykeion, the caduceus, in later times.  Early depictions of the staff show it as a baton stick topped by a golden way that resembled the number eight, though sometimes with its top truncated and open. Later the staff had two intertwined snakes and sometimes it was crowned with a pair of wings and a ball, but the old form remained in use even when Hermes was associated with Mercury by the Romans.\n\nHyginus explained the presence of snakes, saying that Hermes was traveling in Arcadia when he saw two snakes intertwined in battle. He put the caduceus between them and parted, and so said his staff would bring peace.Hyginus. Astronomica, 2.7. Cited in [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Heraldry \"God of Heralds and Bringer of Peace\"]. The Theoi Project: Greek Mythology. The caduceus, historically, appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3500 BC. The two snakes coiled around a stick was a symbol of the god Ningishzida, which served as a mediator between humans and the goddess Ishtar or the supreme Ningirsu. In Greece itself the other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes.  It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre.\n\nHe was represented in doorways, possibly as an amulet of good fortune, or as a symbol of purification.  The caduceus is not to be confused with the Rod of Asclepius, the patron of medicine and son of Apollo, which bears only one snake.  The rod of Asclepius was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States, the caduceus took its place since the 18th century, although this use is declining.  After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce.\n\nHis sandals, called pédila by the Greeks and talaria by the Romans, were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally, they had no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, wearing a robe or cloak, which had the power to confer invisibility. His weapon was a sword of gold, which killed Argos; lent to Perseus to kill Medusa.\n\nIn other religions\n\nChristianity\n\nAccording to Acts 14, when Paul the Apostle visited the city of Lystra, the people there mistook him for Hermes and his companion Barnabas for Zeus.\n\nModern interpretation\n\nPsychology\n\nFor Carl Jung Hermes's role as messenger between realms and as guide to the underworld,A Stevens, [https://books.google.com/books?idML8OAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA115&dqHermes+psychiatry+psychology+of&hl\nen&saX&ei\n4rYNUND5BaSm0QWrre3RCg&ved0CGEQ6AEwCA#v\nonepage&qHermes%20psychiatry%20psychology%20of&f\nfalse On Jung], Taylor & Francis, 1990. made him the god of the unconscious, ([http://www.dennismerrittjungiananalyst.com/Jung_and_Greening.htm Online.]) the mediator between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind, and the guide for inner journeys.JC Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nF29B3MFVKW4C&pgPA108&dq\nHermes+and+the+unconscious&hlen&sa\nX&eiMsANULSLA-PQ0QWCpdn1Cw&ved\n0CDQQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nHermes%20and%20the%20unconscious&ffalse The Transcendent Function: Jung's Model of Psychological Growth Through Dialogue With the Unconscious], SUNY Press, 2004, .\nJung considered the gods Thoth and Hermes to be counterparts.H Yoshida, [https://books.google.com/books?idEnJrPIgnBU8C&pg\nPA153&dqJung+and+Hermes&hl\nen&saX&ei\n6LcNUMXrJYqH0AXMpez8Cw&ved0CEMQ6AEwAg#v\nonepage&qJung%20and%20Hermes&f\nfalse Joyce and Jung: The \"Four Stages of Eroticism\" In a Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man], Peter Lang, 2006, .

    "aggregatedText" : "Hermes (; ) is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology, the son of Zeus and the Pleiad Maia, and the second-youngest of the Olympian gods (Dionysus being the youngest).\n\nHermes was the emissary and messenger of the gods.Burkert, p. 158. Iris has a similar role as divine messenger. Hermes was also \"the divine trickster\"Burkert, p. 156. and \"the god of boundaries and the transgression of boundaries, ... the patron of herdsmen, thieves, graves, and heralds.\"Burkert, p. 158. He is described as moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and divine, and was the conductor of souls into the afterlife.Burkert, pp. 157–158. He was also viewed as the protector and patron of roads and travelers.Lay, [https://books.google.com/books?idBzNfeQSXKfcC&pg\nPA3 p. 3].\n\nIn some myths, he is a trickster and outwits other gods for his own satisfaction or for the sake of humankind. His attributes and symbols include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, winged sandals, and winged cap. His main symbol is the Greek kerykeion or Latin caduceus, which appears in a form of two snakes wrapped around a winged staff with carvings of the other gods.The Latin word ' is an adaptation of the Greek  ', meaning \"herald's wand (or staff)\", deriving from  ', meaning \"messenger, herald, envoy\". Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon; Stuart L. Tyson, \"The Caduceus\", The Scientific Monthly, 34.6 (1932:492–98), p. 493.\n\nIn the Roman adaptation of the Greek pantheon (see interpretatio romana), Hermes is identified with the Roman god Mercury,Bullfinch's Mythology (1978), Crown Publishers, p. 926. who, though inherited from the Etruscans, developed many similar characteristics such as being the patron of commerce.\n\nEtymology and origins\n\nThe earliest form of the name Hermes is the Mycenaean Greek *hermāhās, written  e-ma-a2 (e-ma-ha) in the Linear B syllabic script. Most scholars derive \"Hermes\" from Greek ἕρμα herma, \"prop,. heap of stones, boundary marker\", from which the word hermai (\"boundary markers dedicated to Hermes as a god of travelers\") also derives.. The etymology of ἕρμα itself is unknown, but it is probably not an Proto-Indo-European word. However, the stone etymology is also linked to Indo-European *ser- (“to bind, put together”). Scholarly speculation that \"Hermes\" derives from a more primitive form meaning \"one cairn\" is disputed.Davies, Anna Morpurgo & Duhoux, Yves. Linear B: a 1984 survey. Peeters Publishers, 1985, p. 136. In Greek, a lucky find is a ἕρμαιον hermaion.\n\nAccording to one theory that has received considerable scholarly acceptance, Hermes himself originated as a form of the god Pan, who has been identified as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European pastoral god *Péh2usōn,H. Collitz, \"Wodan, Hermes und Pushan,\" Festskrift tillägnad Hugo Pipping pȧ hans sextioȧrsdag den 5 November 1924 1924, pp 574–587. in his aspect as the god of boundary markers. Later, the epithet supplanted the original name itself and Hermes took over the roles as god of messengers, travelers, and boundaries, which had originally belonged to Pan, while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name in his more rustic aspect as the god of the wild in the relatively isolated mountainous region of Arcadia. In later myths, after the cult of Pan was reintroduced to Attica, Pan was said to be Hermes's son.\n\nOther origins have also been proposed. R. S. P. Beekes rejects the connection with herma and suggests a Pre-Greek origin. Other scholars have suggested that Hermes may be a cognate of the Vedic Sarama.Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology, ed. Félix Guirand & Robert Graves, Hamlyn, 1968, p. 123.\n\nMythology\n\nEarly Greek sources\n\nHomer and Hesiod\n\nHomer and Hesiod portrayed Hermes as the author of skilled or deceptive acts and also as a benefactor of mortals. In the Iliad, he is called \"the bringer of good luck\", \"guide and guardian\", and \"excellent in all the tricks\". He was a divine ally of the Greeks against the Trojans. However, he did protect Priam when he went to the Greek camp to retrieve the body of his son Hector and accompanied them back to Troy.Homer. The Iliad.  The Project Gutenberg Etext. Trans. Samuel Butler.\n\nHe also rescued Ares from a brazen vessel where he had been imprisoned by Otus and Ephialtes. In the Odyssey, Hermes helps his great-grand son, the protagonist Odysseus, by informing him about the fate of his companions, who were turned into animals by the power of Circe. Hermes instructed Odysseus to protect himself by chewing a magic herb; he also told Calypso of Zeus' order to free Odysseus from her island to allow him to continue his journey back home. When Odysseus killed the suitors of his wife, Hermes led their souls to Hades.Homer. The Odyssey. Plain Label Books, 1990. Trans. Samuel Butler. pp. 40, 81–82, 192–195. In The Works and Days, when Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora to disgrace humanity by punishing Prometheus's act of giving fire to man, every god gave her a gift, and Hermes' gifts were lies, seductive words, and a dubious character. Hermes was then instructed to take her as wife to Epimetheus.Hesiod.

Trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White, 1914.\n\nAthenian tragic playwrights\n\nAeschylus wrote in The Eumenides that Hermes helped Orestes kill Clytemnestra under a false identity and other stratagems, and also said that he was the god of searches, and those who seek things lost or stolen.Aeschylus, Suppliant Women 919.  Quoted in [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Travel God of Searchers]. The Theoi Project: Greek Mythology. In Philoctetes, Sophocles invokes Hermes when Odysseus needs to convince Philoctetes to join the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks, and in Euripides' Rhesus Hermes helps Dolon spy on the Greek navy.\n\nAesop\n\nAesop featured him in several of his fables, as ruler of the gate of prophetic dreams, as the god of athletes, of edible roots, and of hospitality. He also said that Hermes had assigned each person his share of intelligence.Aesop. Fables 474, 479, 520, 522, 563, 564.

Project Gutenberg. invokes him as the one \"of many shifts (polytropos), blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods.\"Hymn to Hermes 13. The word polutropos (\"of many shifts, turning many ways, of many devices, ingenious, or much wandering\") is also used to describe Odysseus in the first line of the Odyssey. Hermes, as an inventor of fire,In the Homeric hymn, \"after he had fed the loud-bellowing cattle... he gathered much wood and sought the craft of fire. He also invented written music and many other things. He took a splendid laurel branch, gripped it in his palm, and twirled it in pomegranate wood\" (lines 105, 108–10) is a parallel of the Titan Prometheus. In addition to the lyre, Hermes was believed to have invented many types of racing and the sports of wrestling and boxing, and therefore was a patron of athletes.\"First Inventors... Mercurius [Hermes] first taught wrestling to mortals.\" – Hyginus, Fabulae 277.\n\nTranslations\n\nIn 1820 Shelley translated this hymn.N Richardson, [https://books.google.com/books?idk0jtO6Zd5ikC&pg\nPT33&lpgPT33&dq\nShelley+translation+of+the+hymn+to+Hermes&sourcebl&ots\nw0Rdngbnxl&sigl7FNfF_BrsM8sApZhEpjzsNbTB4&hl\nen&saX&ei\noPMWVeNTic5o--KBiAM&ved0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v\nonepage&qShelley%20translation%20of%20the%20hymn%20to%20Hermes&f\nfalse The Homeric Hymns] (edited by J Cashford), Penguin UK, 2003, .\n\nH.

Tradition says that his first temple was built by Lycaon.  From there the cult would have been taken to Athens, and then radiated to the whole of Greece, according to Smith, and his temples and statues became extremely numerous. Lucian of Samosata said he saw the temples of Hermes everywhere.Lucian of Samosata. The Works of Lucian of Samosata.  BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008. Volume 1, p. 107.\n\nIn many places, temples were consecrated in conjunction with Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.\nAs a patron of the gym and fighting, Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the Olympic Games.  His statue was held there on an altar dedicated to him and Apollo together.Johnston, Sarah Iles. Initiation in Myth, Initiation in Practice. IN Dodd, David Brooks & Faraone, Christopher A.

However, Plato said that Socrates attended a Hermaea. Of all the festivals involving Greek games, these were the most like initiations because participation in them was restricted to young boys and excluded adults.Scanlon, Thomas Francis.

Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 92–93.\n\nHermai/Herms\n\nIn Ancient Greece, Hermes was a phallic god of boundaries. His name, in the form herma, was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones; each traveler added a stone to the pile. In the 6th century BC, Hipparchos, the son of Pisistratus, replaced the cairns that marked the midway point between each village deme at the central agora of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of Hermes with a beard. An erect phallus rose from the base. In the more primitive Mount Kyllini or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus. In Athens, herms were placed outside houses for good luck. \"That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an Olympian god is astounding,\" Walter Burkert remarked.Walter Burkert, 1985. Greek Religion (Harvard University Press)\n\nIn 415 BC, when the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War, all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized one night.  The Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or from the anti-war faction within Athens itself. Socrates' pupil Alcibiades was suspected of involvement, and Socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 6.27.\n\nHermes's possible offspring\n\nPan\n\nThe satyr-like Greek god of nature, shepherds and flocks, Pan, could possibly be the son of Hermes through the nymph Dryope.Hyginus, Fabula 160, makes Hermes the father of Pan. In the Homeric Hymn to Pan, Pan's mother fled in fright from her newborn son's goat-like appearance.\n\nPriapus\n\nDepending on the sources consulted, the god Priapus could be understood as a son of Hermes.Karl Kerényi, Gods of the Greeks, 1951, p. 175, citing G. Kaibel, Epigrammata graeca ex lapidibus collecta, 817, where the other god's name, both father and son of Hermes, is obscured; according to other sources, Priapus was a son of Dionysus and Aphrodite.\n\nAutolycus\n\nAutolycus, the Prince of Thieves, was a son of Hermes and Chione (mortal) and grandfather of Odysseus.Bibliotheca 1.9.16.\n\nExtended list of Hermes's lovers and children\n\n# Acacallis\n## Cydon\n# Aglaurus\n## Eumolpus\n# AmphionAs presumed by Philostratus the Elder in his Imagines, 1.10.\n# Alcidameia of Corinth\n## Bounos\n# Antianeira / Laothoe\n## Echion, Argonaut\n## Erytus, Argonaut\n# Apemosyne\n# Aphrodite\n## Hermaphroditus\n## Tyche (possibly)\n# Astabe, daughter of Peneus\n## Astacus\n# Carmentis\n## Evander\n# Chione / Stilbe / TelaugeEustathius on Homer, 804.\n## Autolycus\n# Chryses, priest of Apollo\n# Chthonophyle\n## Polybus of Sicyon\n# Crocus\n# Daeira the Oceanid\n## Eleusis\n# Dryope, Arcadian nymph\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Erytheia (daughter of Geryon)\n## NoraxPausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.17.5 10.17.5].\n# Eupolemeia (daughter of Myrmidon)\n## Aethalides\n# Hecate\n## three unnamed daughtersTzetzes on Lycophron, 680.\n# Herse\n## Cephalus\n## Ceryx (possibly)\n# Hiereia\n## GigasThis Gigas was the father of Ischenus, who was said to have been sacrificed during an outbreak of famine in Olympia; Tzetzes on Lycophron 42.\n# Iphthime (daughter of Dorus)\n## Lycus\n## Pherespondus\n## Pronomus\n# Libye (daughter of Palamedes)\n## LibysHyginus, Fabulae, 160.\n# Ocyrhoe\n## Caicus\n# OdrysusClement of Rome, Homilia, 5.16.\n# Orsinoe, nymphScholia on Euripides, Rhesus, 36.\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Palaestra, daughter of Choricus\n# Pandrosus\n## Ceryx (possibly)\n# Peitho\n# Penelope\n## Nomios\n## Pan (possibly)\n# Persephone (unsuccessfully wooed her)\n# PerseusPseudo-Hyginus, De Astronomica 2.12.\n# Phylodameia\n## Pharis\n# PolydeucesPtolemy Hephaestion, 6 in Photius, 190.\n# Polymele (daughter of Phylas)\n## Eudorus\n# Rhene, nymph\n## Saon of SamothraceSaon could also have been the son of Zeus and a local nymph; both versions in Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5.48.2.\n# Sicilian nymph\n## Daphnis\n# Sose, nymph\n## Agreus\n# Tanagra, daughter of Asopus\n# Theobula / Clytie / Clymene / Cleobule / Myrto / Phaethusa the Danaid\n## Myrtilus\n# ThersesClement of Rome, Homilia, 5.16; otherwise unknown.\n# Thronia\n## Arabus\n# Urania, Muse\n## Linus (possibly)\n# Unknown mothers\n## Abderus\n## Angelia\n## Dolops\n## Palaestra\n\nGenealogy\n\nArt and iconography\n\nThe image of Hermes evolved and varied according to Greek art and culture. During Archaic Greece he was usually depicted as a mature man, bearded, dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. During Classical and Hellenistic Greece he is usually depicted young and nude, with athleticism, as befits the god of speech and of the gymnastics, or a robe, a formula is set predominantly through the centuries.  When represented as Logios (Greek: Λόγιος, speaker), his attitude is consistent with the attribute. Phidias left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and Praxiteles another, also well known, showing him with the baby Dionysus in his arms. At all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods, Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all together.Müller, Karl Otfried. [https://books.google.com/books?id\noSsGAAAAQAAJ&printsecfrontcover&dq\nAncient+art+and+its+remains:+or,+A+manual+of+the+arch%C3%A6ology+of+art&hlen&ei\nMr-9TcWKK6Xr0gGGodCOAw&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n1&ved0CCoQ6AEwAA#v\nonepage&q&f=false Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the archæology of art]. B. Quaritch, 1852. pp. 483–488.\n\nAmong these objects is a wide-brimmed hat, the petasos, widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun, and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings; sometimes the hat is not present, and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair.  Another object is the Porta: a stick, called a rhabdomyolysis (stick) or skeptron (scepter), which is referred to as a magic wand. Some early sources say that this was the bat he received from Apollo, but others question the merits of this claim. It seems that there may have been two canes, one of a shepherd's staff, as stated in the Homeric Hymn, and the other a magic wand, according to some authors. His bat also came to be called kerykeion, the caduceus, in later times.  Early depictions of the staff show it as a baton stick topped by a golden way that resembled the number eight, though sometimes with its top truncated and open. Later the staff had two intertwined snakes and sometimes it was crowned with a pair of wings and a ball, but the old form remained in use even when Hermes was associated with Mercury by the Romans.\n\nHyginus explained the presence of snakes, saying that Hermes was traveling in Arcadia when he saw two snakes intertwined in battle. He put the caduceus between them and parted, and so said his staff would bring peace.Hyginus. Astronomica, 2.7. Cited in [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Heraldry \"God of Heralds and Bringer of Peace\"]. The Theoi Project: Greek Mythology. The caduceus, historically, appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3500 BC. The two snakes coiled around a stick was a symbol of the god Ningishzida, which served as a mediator between humans and the goddess Ishtar or the supreme Ningirsu. In Greece itself the other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes.  It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre.\n\nHe was represented in doorways, possibly as an amulet of good fortune, or as a symbol of purification.  The caduceus is not to be confused with the Rod of Asclepius, the patron of medicine and son of Apollo, which bears only one snake.  The rod of Asclepius was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States, the caduceus took its place since the 18th century, although this use is declining.  After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce.\n\nHis sandals, called pédila by the Greeks and talaria by the Romans, were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally, they had no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, wearing a robe or cloak, which had the power to confer invisibility. His weapon was a sword of gold, which killed Argos; lent to Perseus to kill Medusa.\n\nIn other religions\n\nChristianity\n\nAccording to Acts 14, when Paul the Apostle visited the city of Lystra, the people there mistook him for Hermes and his companion Barnabas for Zeus.\n\nModern interpretation\n\nPsychology\n\nFor Carl Jung Hermes's role as messenger between realms and as guide to the underworld,A Stevens, [https://books.google.com/books?idML8OAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA115&dqHermes+psychiatry+psychology+of&hl\nen&saX&ei\n4rYNUND5BaSm0QWrre3RCg&ved0CGEQ6AEwCA#v\nonepage&qHermes%20psychiatry%20psychology%20of&f\nfalse On Jung], Taylor & Francis, 1990. made him the god of the unconscious, ([http://www.dennismerrittjungiananalyst.com/Jung_and_Greening.htm Online.]) the mediator between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind, and the guide for inner journeys.JC Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nF29B3MFVKW4C&pgPA108&dq\nHermes+and+the+unconscious&hlen&sa\nX&eiMsANULSLA-PQ0QWCpdn1Cw&ved\n0CDQQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nHermes%20and%20the%20unconscious&ffalse The Transcendent Function: Jung's Model of Psychological Growth Through Dialogue With the Unconscious], SUNY Press, 2004, .\nJung considered the gods Thoth and Hermes to be counterparts.H Yoshida, [https://books.google.com/books?idEnJrPIgnBU8C&pg\nPA153&dqJung+and+Hermes&hl\nen&saX&ei\n6LcNUMXrJYqH0AXMpez8Cw&ved0CEMQ6AEwAg#v\nonepage&qJung%20and%20Hermes&f\nfalse Joyce and Jung: The \"Four Stages of Eroticism\" In a Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man], Peter Lang, 2006, .
