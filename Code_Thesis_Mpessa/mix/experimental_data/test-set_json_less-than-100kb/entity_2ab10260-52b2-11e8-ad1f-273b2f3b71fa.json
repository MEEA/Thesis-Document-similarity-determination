In a study done by MIT, FX-87 yields similar performance results as functional languages on programs that do not contain side effects (Fibonacci, Factorial). FX-87 did yield a great performance increase when matching DNA sequences.\n\nKFX is the kernel language of FX-87. It was described in 'Polymorphic Effect Systems', J.M.
