  "textBody" : "In linguistics, declension is the inflection (changing the form of a word) of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, numerals, and articles to indicate number (at least singular and plural), case (nominative or subjective, genitive or possessive, etc.), and/or gender. A declension is also a group of nouns that follow a particular pattern of inflection.\n\nDeclension occurs in many of the world's languages. Among modern languages, declension is an important aspect of Arabic, Finnish, Turkish, many Amerindian languages such as Quechua, Bantu languages such as Zulu, Slavic languages such as Russian, some Germanic languages such as High German, and some others. In the ancient world, languages that were highly declined included Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Old English was a moderately inflected language, as befits its Indo-European and especially its Germanic linguistic ancestry, but its declensions greatly simplified as it evolved into Modern English.\n\nModern English\n\nIn Modern English, the system of declensions is very simple compared to some other languages, so much so that the term declension is rarely applied to English in practice. Most nouns in English have distinct singular and plural forms and have distinct plain and possessive forms. Plurality is most commonly shown by the clitic -s (or -es), whereas possession is always shown by the clitic -'s (or by just the apostrophe) attached to the noun. Consider, for example, the forms of the noun girl:\n\nMost speakers pronounce all of the forms other than the singular plain form (girl) exactly the same (though some speakers may pronounce the plural possessive as two syllables). By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:\n\nIn that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.\n\nThere can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun Britain has the associated descriptive adjective British and the demonym Briton. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.\n\nPronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:\n\nWhereas nouns do not distinguish between the subjective (nominative) and  objective (oblique) cases, some pronouns do; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference between he (subjective) and him (objective), as in \"He saw it\" and \"It saw him\"; similarly, consider who, which is subjective, and the objective whom.\n\nIn general, gender is not grammaticalized in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. alumnus (masculine singular) and alumna (feminine singular). Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: Andrew and Andrea, Paul and Paula, etc. Additionally, suffixes such as -ess, -ette, and -er are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.\n\nMost adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline (e.g., \"I'll take the reds\", meaning \"I'll take the red ones\" or as shorthand for \"I'll take the red wines\"). Also, the demonstrative determiners this and that are declined for number, as these and those. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: blond (male) and blonde (female). Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The article is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words that and possibly she correspond to forms of the predecessor of the (sē m., þæt n., sēo f.) as it was declined in Old English.\n\nLatin\n\nAn example of a Latin noun declension is given below, using the word homo (man, human), which belongs to Latin's third declension.\n\n* (nominative and vocative singular) \"[the] man\" [as a subject] (e.g., , the man is standing there)\n* (accusative singular) \"[the] man\" [as a direct object] (e.g., , toward the man, in the sense of argument directed personally; , I saw the man)\n* (genitive singular) \"of [the] man\" [as a possessor] (e.g., , the man's name is Claudius)\n* (dative singular) \"to or for [the] man\" [as an indirect object] (e.g., , I gave a present to the man; , Man is a wolf to man)\n* (ablative singular) \"[the] man\" (mainly used following many prepositions, and in the ablative absolute construction, or to mean \"by\", \"with\" or \"from\" without a preposition) (e.g. , I am taller than the man)\n*homines, nominative, vocative and accusative plural\n*hominum, genitive plural\n*hominibus, dative and ablative plural\n\nThere are two further noun cases in Latin, the vocative and the locative:\n* The vocative case indicates that a person or thing is being addressed (e.g. O Tite, cur ancillam pugnas?, O Titus, why do you fight the slave girl?)\n* The locative case is used for specific spatial relationships. It indicates that a locative-case noun is the location of another noun or a verb (e.g., Romulus regnat Romae, Romulus rules in Rome). It is a feature only of certain place-names, especially of cities and towns (e.g. Roma, Tarquinii, Carthago), small islands (e.g. Samos), and the nouns , , and  (in the country, in the earth, at home). The locative case is rare in classic Latin, and it is mostly absorbed in the ablative case. An important feature of the locative-case nouns is that they are not accompanied by a preposition (as the example illustrates).\n\nMany European languages of Indo-European origin have a set of cases which are similar to those of Latin, for example German and other Germanic languages like Icelandic omit the vocative and ablative; classical Greek omitted the ablative and modern Greek also omits the dative; some Slavic languages also have the instrumental case.\n\nMost of these languages have several declensions, i.e. classes of words with different schemes for determining the case endings. Furthermore, it is notable that in all these languages and declensions it is the exception rather than the rule for there to be a one-to-one correspondence between cases and endings, so that often one has to deduce from the context which case is meant.\n\nSanskrit\n\nSanskrit, another Indo-European language, has eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative and instrumental.James Clackson (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?idDJDjNp6wODoC&pg\nPA90 Indo-European linguistics: an introduction], p.90 Some don't count vocative as a separate case, despite it having a distinctive ending in the singular, but consider it as a different use of the nominative.Amba Kulkarni and Peter Scharf (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?idt2f1hneiV08C&pg\nPA68 Sanskrit Computational Linguistics: First and Second International Symposia Rocquencourt, France, October 29-31, 2007 and Providence, RI, USA, May 15-17, 2008, Revised Selected Papers], Volume 5402 of Lecture notes in artificial intelligence, Springer, 2009, , pp. 64–68.\n\nSanskrit grammatical cases have been analyzed extensively. The grammarian Pāṇini identified seven semantic roles or karaka, which correspond closely to the eight cases:Pieter Cornelis Verhagen, [https://books.google.com/books?id5vmaX_JQzc4C&pg\nPA281 Handbook of oriental studies: India.
