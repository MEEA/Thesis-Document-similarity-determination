  "textBody" : "The British thermal unit (Btu or BTU) is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. It is part of the United States customary units.In a short note, Woledge notes that the actual technical term \"British thermal unit\" apparently originated in the United States, and was subsequently adopted in Great Britain. See  Its counterpart in the metric system  is the calorie, which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. Heat is now known to be equivalent to energy, for which the SI unit is the joule; one BTU is about 1055 joules. While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work, they are still important in many fields. As examples, in the United States the price of natural gas is quoted in dollars per million BTUs.\n\nDefinitions \n\nA BTU was originally defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 avoirdupois pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one atmosphere. There are several different definitions of the BTU that are now known to differ slightly. This reflects the fact that the temperature change of a mass of water due to the addition of a specific amount of heat (calculated in energy units, usually joules) depends slightly upon the water's initial temperature. As seen in the table below, definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures vary by up to 0.5%. In the table, thermochemical and steam table (IT) values, which are now defined in terms of exact values in joules, have been rounded to four decimal places.\n\nPrefixes\n\nUnits KBtu are used in building energy use tracking and heating system sizing. Energy Use Index (EUI) represents KBtu per square foot of conditioned floor area. \"K\" stands for 1,000. \n\nThe units MBtu and MMBtu are used in the natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 and 1,000,000 BTUs, respectively. This is presumably from the Roman numeral system, where \"M\" stands for one thousand (1,000). However, Roman Numeral MM represents two thousand, adding confusion if the Roman system is cited as the source for MM.\n\nThere is an ambiguity in that the metric system uses the prefix \"M\" to indicate one million (1,000,000), and \"MBtu\" is also used to indicate one million BTUs. Because of this ambiguity, some authors have deprecated the use of MBtu. \n\nEnergy analysts accustomed to the metric \"k\" for 1,000 are more likely to use MBtu to represent one million, especially in documents where M represents one million in other energy or cost units, such as MW, MWh and $.\n\nThe unit therm is used to represent 100,000 (or 105) BTUs. A decatherm is 10 therms or one MBtu. The unit quad is commonly used to represent one quadrillion (1015) BTUs.\n\nConversions \n\nOne Btu is approximately:\n* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilojoules)\n* 0.293071 W·h (watt hours)\n* 252 to 253 cal (calories, or \"little calories\")\n* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, \"large calories\", or \"food calories\")\n* 25,031 to 25,160 ft·pdl (foot-poundal)\n* 778 to 782 ft·lbf (foot-pounds-force)\n* 5.40395 (lbf/in2)·ft3\n\nA Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a 1 lb weight .Energy and the Environment.
