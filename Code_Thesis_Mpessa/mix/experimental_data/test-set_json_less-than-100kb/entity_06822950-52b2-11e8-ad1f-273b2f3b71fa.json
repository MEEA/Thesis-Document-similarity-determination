Genesis 13:10 refers to the \"garden of God\" (not called Eden by name),http://bible.oremus.org/?passageGenesis+13 and the \"trees of the garden\" are mentioned in Ezekiel 31.http://bible.oremus.org/?passage\nEzekiel+31 The Book of Zechariah and the Book of Psalms also refer to trees and water in relation to the temple without explicitly mentioning Eden.\n\nTraditionally, scholars favored deriving the name \"Eden\" from the Akkadian edinnu, derived from a Sumerian word edin meaning \"plain\" or \"steppe\". Chaim Cohen, however, writes that Eden is more closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning \"fruitful, well-watered.\" Another interpretation associates the name \"Eden\" with a Hebrew word for \"pleasure\"; thus the Douay-Rheims Bible in Genesis 2:8 has the wording\n\"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure\" (rather than \"a garden in Eden\"). The Hebrew term is translated \"pleasure\" in Sarah's secret saying in .[http://studybible.info/strongs/H5731 H5731 Eden]  – The same as H5730 (masculine); Eden= \"pleasure\" ... the first habitat of man after the creation; site unknown\n\nMuch like records of the great flood, the creation story and the account of the confusion of languages, the story of Eden echoes the Mesopotamian myth of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the Tree of Life.

It may also represent the divine garden on Zion, and the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem. The imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubim, has been compared to the images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the nehushtan) and guardian cherubs.\n\nBiblical narratives\n\nGenesis\n\nThe second part of the Genesis creation narrative, , opens with Adonai Elohim (the  God, lit. YHWH Elohim, see Names of God in Judaism) creating the first man (Adam), whom he placed in a garden that he planted \"eastward in Eden\". \"The root of Eden denotes fertility. Where the wondrously fertile gard was thought to have been located (if a realistic location was ever conceived) is unclear.

Last of all, the God made a woman (Eve) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In chapter three, the man and the woman were seduced by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit, and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the tree of life, and thus living forever. Cherubim were placed east of the garden, \"and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep him away from the tree of life\" ().\n\n lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: Pishon, Gihon, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. It also refers to the land of Cush—translated/interpreted as Ethiopia, but thought by some to equate to Cossaea, a Greek name for the land of the Kassites. These lands lie north of Elam, immediately to the east of ancient Babylon, which, unlike Ethiopia, does lie within the region being described. In Antiquities of the Jews, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Pishon as what \"the Greeks called Ganges\" and the Geon (Gehon) as the Nile.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews. Book I, Chapter 1, Section 3.\n\nEzekiel\n\nIn  the prophet Ezekiel the \"son of man\" sets down God's word against the king of Tyre: the king was the \"seal of perfection\", adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation, placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub. But the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: \"All the nations who knew you are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.\" (v.19).\n\nAccording to Terje Stordalen, the Eden in Ezekiel appears to be located in Lebanon. \"[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden\", and there are connections between paradise, the garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings. Edward Lipinski and Peter Kyle McCarter have suggested that the Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise), the oldest Sumerian version of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.\n\nProposed locations\n\nThere have been suggestions for The Garden of Eden’s location: for example, at the head of the Persian Gulf, in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea;  and in the Armenian Highlands or Armenian Plateau.Zevit, Ziony.

In this painting, only the action that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"paradise\" (Hebrew פרדס, pardes), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500 BCE. The word \"pardes\" occurs three times in the Old Testament, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the Song of Solomon iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (pardes) of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; Ecclesiastes 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (pardes), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in Nehemiah ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (pardes), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples pardes clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the apocalyptic literature and in the Talmud \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the New Testament \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary Hellenistic influences.\n*In ancient Hindu mythology, Nandankanan is a garden of the deities where the virtuous souls of the dead can roam freely.\n\nOther views\n\nJewish eschatology\n\nIn the Talmud and the Jewish Kabbalah,[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid\n39&letterE Gan Eden] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010. the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\". The Rabbanim differentiate between Gan and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the Gan, whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.\n\nAccording to Jewish eschatology,[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba – The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid\n460&letterE#1239 Eshatology] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010. the higher Gan Eden is called the \"Garden of Righteousness\". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly chayot carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are \"clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life\" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones. This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms gehinnom\"Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish.\" [http://www.jewfaq.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?Keywords=Gehinnom Gehinnom – Judaism 101] websourced 02-10-2010. and sheol, figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from heaven.\n\nIn modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.\n\nIslamic view\n\nEvents taking place in the Garden of Eden are spoken about prominently in the Quran and the tafsir (interpretation). The term \"Jannāt `Adni\" (\"Gardens of Eden\" or \"Gardens of Perpetual Residence\") is used in the Qur'an for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of \"the Garden\" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), meaning the Garden of Eden, but without the word \"`Adn\".See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences]. There are other places that talk about events there, without mentioning the location. This includes surat Sad, which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71–88), surat al-Baqarah, surat al-A'raf, and surat al-Hijr. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Iblis from the garden and his subsequent tempting of Adam and Eve. After Iblis refuses to follow God's command to bow down to Adam for being his greatest creation, Allah transforms him into Satan as a punishment. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Despite this, however, Satan, disguised as a serpent, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying Allah.Leaman, Oliver The Quran, an encyclopedia, p. 11, 2006 These stories are also featured in the Islamic hadith collections, including al-Tabari.Wheeler, Brannon Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam p. 16, 2006\n\nLatter-day Saints\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons or Latter-day Saints) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as Adam-ondi-Ahman, located in present-day Daviess County, Missouri. It is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the final judgement in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.\n\nNumerous early leaders of the Church, including Brigham Young, Heber C.

Cannon, taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby Jackson County, Missouri,[http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Garden_of_Eden_in_Missouri \"Joseph Smith/Garden of Eden in Missouri\"], FairMormon Answers but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself.

Michelangelo depicted a scene at the Garden of Eden in the Sistine Chapel ceiling. In the Divine Comedy, Dante places the Garden at the top of Mt. Purgatory. For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human love and sexuality, often associated with the classic and medieval trope of the locus amoenus.
