  "textBody" : "The Isle of Man is an island in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Ireland in Western Europe, with a population of almost 85,000. It is a British Crown dependency. It has a small islet, the Calf of Man, to its south. It is located at .\n\nDimensions\n\nArea:\ntotal:\n572 km2 (57200 ha)\nland:\n571 km2 (57100 ha)\nwater:\n1 km2 (100 ha)\n\nThis makes it:\n*slightly more than three times the size of Washington, DC\n*slightly more than one third the size of Hertfordshire\n*slightly smaller than Saint Lucia.\n\nCoast and Territorial Sea\n\nThe Isle of Man has a coastline of 160 km, and a territorial sea extending to a maximum of 12 nm from the coast, or the midpoint between other countries. The total territorial sea area is about 4000 km2 or 1500 sq miles, which is about 87% of the total jurisdiction of the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man only holds exclusive fishing rights in the first 3 nm. The territorial sea is managed by the Isle of Man Government Department of Infrastructure.\n\nThe Raad ny Foillan long distance footpath runs 153 km around the Manx coast.\n\nClimate\n\nThe Isle of Man enjoys a temperate climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Average rainfall is high compared to the majority of the British Isles, due to its location to the western side of Great Britain and sufficient distance from Ireland for moisture to be accumulated by the prevailing south-westerly winds. Average rainfall is highest at Snaefell, where it is around 1900 mm a year. At lower levels it can fall to around 800 mm a year.\n\nTemperatures remain fairly cool, with the recorded maximum being  at Ronaldsway.\n\nTerrain \n\nThe island's terrain is varied. There are two mountainous areas divided by a central valley which runs between Douglas and Peel. The highest point in the Isle of Man, Snaefell, is in the northern area and reaches 620 m above sea level. The northern end of the island is a flat plain, consisting of glacial tills and marine sediments. To the south the island is more hilly, with distinct valleys. There is no land below sea level.\n\nLand use \n\n*Arable land: 43.86%\n*Permanent crops: 0%\n*Other: 56.14% (includes permanent pastures, forests, mountain and heathland) (2011)\n\nNatural hazards and environmental issues\n\nThere are few severe natural hazards, the most common being high winds, rough seas and dense fog. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the frequency of high winds, heavy rains, summer droughts and flooding both from heavy rain and from high seas. Snow fall has decreased significantly over the past century while temperatures are increasing year round with rainfall decreasing.\n\nAir pollution, marine pollution and waste disposal are issues in the Isle of Man.\n\nProtected sites for nature conservation\n\nIn order of importance, international first, non-statutory last.\n\nUNESCO Biosphere Reserves\n\n*The entire territory of the Isle of Man, including all land, sea, freshwater, airspace and seabed is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve\n\nRamsar sites\n\n*Ballaugh Curraghs (2006, ).

Almost all its population lives on or very near the coast.",
