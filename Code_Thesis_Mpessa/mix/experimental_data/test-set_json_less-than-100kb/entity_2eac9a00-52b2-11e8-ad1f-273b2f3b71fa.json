After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral.\n\nLund University has eight faculties, with additional campuses in the cities of Malmö and Helsingborg, with 42,000 students[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/facts-and-figures Facts and figures] Lund University web site. Retrieved 21 May 2017.  in 302 different programmes and 2,046 freestanding courses. The University has some 600 partner universities in over 70 countries and it belongs to the League of European Research Universities as well as the global Universitas 21 network.\n\nTwo major facilities for materials research are in Lund University: MAX IV, which is a world-leading synchrotron radiation laboratory – inaugurated in June 2016, and European Spallation Source (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be opened in 2023.[https://europeanspallationsource.se/ess-mandate ESS Mandate] Retrieved 21 May 2017.\n\nThe university centers on the Lundagård park adjacent to the Lund Cathedral, with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nHistory \n\nMedieval origins \n\nThe city of Lund has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the Katedralskolan) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school.\n\nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureus degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by studia generalia in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral.[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/a-brief-history A Brief History of Lund University] The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.\n\n17th–19th centuries \n\nAfter the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named Academia Carolina after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of Åbo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in Germany).\n\nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: law, theological, medicine and philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy.\n\nThe Scanian War in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the Lund Cathedral and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.\n\nIn 1713, Charles XII of Sweden entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for three years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was Andreas Rydelius.\n\nPeace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with Uppsala University, it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.\n\nAround 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor Esaias Tegnér was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student C. G. Brunius, who studied ancient languages under Tegnér and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.\n\nIn 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted Nordic student meetings together with the University of Copenhagen.\n\nA student called Elsa Collin was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a spex.\n\n20th century – present \n\nIn the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. Lund Institute of Technology was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.\n\nIn recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally[http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/UF0513_2009A01_BR_A40BR1002.pdf Utbildning Gymnasieungdomars studieintresse läsåret 2009/2010] and internationally. For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master's applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.\n\nWomen at the university\n\nThe first woman to study in Lund was Hildegard Björck (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in Uppsala and had there been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree. Her tenure in Lund was however very brief and the medical student Hedda Andersson who entered the university later in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so) is usually mentioned as the first woman at Lund University.[http://www.med.lu.se/plain/english/about_the_faculty/history_of_the_faculty/personalities_discoveries_and_innovations/hedda_andersson Lund University Medical Faculty] Hedda Andersson (1861-1950) Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor's chair was the historian Birgitta Odén (1965). In 1992 Boel Flodgren, Professor of Business Law, was appointed rector magnificus (or, strictly speaking, rectrix magnifica) of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be the head of a European university.\n\nCampus \n\nThe university's facilities are mainly located in the small city of Lund in Scania, about 15 km away from central Malmö and 50 km from Copenhagen. The university's prominence and large student population have much impact on the city, effectively making it a university town. Over a hundred university buildings[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/images/maps/2010campusmap.pdf - Campus map]  scatter around town, most of them in an area covering more than 1 km², stretching towards the north-east from Lundagård park in the very centre of town. Buildings in and around Lundagård include the main building, Kungshuset, the Historical Museum and the Academic Society's headquarters. The main library building is located in a park 400 meters to the north, followed by the large hospital complex.\n\nLund University has a satellite campus in nearby Malmö, Sweden's third largest city. The Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts' three academies: Malmö Art Academy, Malmö Academy of Music and Malmö Theatre Academy, are all located in Malmö. The city is also the location of Skåne University Hospital, where Lund University performs a considerable amount of research and medical training.\n\nCampus Helsingborg is, as the name suggests, located in the city of Helsingborg, almost 50 km from Lund. Opened in 2000, it consists of a building in the city centre, right next to the central train station and the harbour. Nearly 3,000 students are based on the campus.[http://www.ch.lu.se/index.php?id=235 Campus Helsingborg - about]  The Department of Service Management and the Department of Communication and Media are among those located at the campus in Helsingborg.\n\nTeaching and training at the School of Aviation (LUSA) takes place at an airfield next to the town of Ljungbyhed, about 40 km away from Lund.\n\nLibrary \n\nLund University library was established in 1668 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received legal deposit copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the Royal Library in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.Lund University library website, statistics for 2006, \nThe current main building at Helgonabacken opened in 1907. Before that, the old building was Liberiet close to the city's cathedral. Liberiet was built as a library in the 15th century, but now serves as a cafe.\n\nHospital \n\nEducation and research in the health sciences at the university is operated in cooperation with Skåne University Hospital, located in both Lund and Malmö. Medical education takes place in the Biomedical Centre, next to the hospital in Lund. Nursing and occupational therapy are taught in the Health Sciences Centre nearby. The university also operates the Clinical Research Centre in Malmö, featuring many specialized laboratories. There are over 100 faculty.\n\nOrganisation \n\nAdministration \n\nThe University Board is the University's highest decision-making body. The Board comprises the Vice-Chancellor, representatives of the teaching staff and students, and representatives of the community and business sector.[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about-lund-university/vice-chancellor-and-management/who-runs-the-university Lund University - Who Runs the University?]  Chair of the board is Margot Wallström. Executive power lies with the Vice-Chancellor and the University Management Group, to which most other administrative bodies are subordinate.\n\nFaculties \n\nLund University is divided into eight faculties:\n*Faculties of Humanities and Theology\n*Faculty of Engineering (LTH)\n*Faculty of Fine & Performing Arts\n*Faculty of Law\n*Faculty of Medicine\n*Faculty of Science\n*Faculty of Social Sciences\n*School of Economics and Management\n\nResearch centres \n\nThe university is also organised into more than 20 institutes and research centres, such as:\n\n*Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS)\n*Biomedical Centre\n*Centre for Biomechanics\n*Centre for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering - Kemicentrum\n*[http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund Centre for East and South-East Asian Studies]\n*Centre for European Studies\n*Centre for Geographical Information Systems (GIS Centrum)\n*Centre for Innovation, Research and Competence in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE)\n*Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University\n*Centre for Molecular Protein Science\n*Centre for Risk Analysis and Management (LUCRAM)\n*International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University (IIIEE)\n*Lund Functional Food Science Centre\n*Lund University Diabetes Centre (LUDC)\n*MAX lab - Accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation and nuclear physics research\n*Pufendorf Institute\n*Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\n*Swedish South Asian Studies Network\n\nAcademics \n\nEducation\n\nApproximately 42,000 students study within one of the 276 educational programs, the 100 international master's programmes or the 2,200 independent courses. Around five hundred courses are, or can be, held in English for the benefit of international exchange students. There are several programmes allowing foreign students to study abroad at the University. Notable exchangees include United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who spent time at Lund University in the 1960s conducting research.Linda, Bayer \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg\" (Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2000), 46. The university offers 9 out of the 20 most sought after programmes in Sweden. The master's programme in International Marketing is the most popular choice in the country, with almost a thousand applications yearly.\n\nResearch\n\nLund University is well known as one of Scandinavia's largest research universities.[http://www.euroscholars.eu/universities/lund.htm Lund University, Sweden] , Euro Scholars Website It ranks among top performers in the European Union in terms of papers accepted for publication in scientific journals.[ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/indicators/docs/3rd_report_snaps10.pdf The University Model for the 21st Century] It is one of Sweden's top receiver of research grants, most of which come from government-funded bodies. The EU is the university's second largest external research funder and Lund is the 23rd largest receiver of funding within the union's Seventh Framework Programme.[http://ec.europa.eu/research/evaluations/pdf/archive/other_reports_studies_and_documents/fp7_interim_evaluation_expert_group_report.pdf#viewfit&pagemode\nnone Interim Evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme] The university is active in many internationally important research areas such as nanotechnology, climate change and stem cell biology.\n\nInnovation\n\nOne of the most famous innovations based on research from Lund University is diagnostic ultrasound, which is today a routine method of examination in hospitals around the world. Other\nexamples of pioneering innovations are the artificial kidney, which laid the foundations for the multinational company Gambro and which makes life easier for dialysis patients worldwide, and Bluetooth technology, which enables wireless communication over short distances.\n[http://www.luis.lu.se/media/Innovation_webb_ENG.pdf Over 300 years of useful Research - Lund University].

Lund was ranked 60th in the world in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings. In 2015, it ranked  90th in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, it was in the 101-150 category. \nIn the Leiden Ranking for 2017, Lund University is ranked 84th in the world.\n\nIn 2014, the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, Ecuador (Senescyt), as a parameter for awarding scholarships, created a list of top Universities around the world placing Lund University in Top 1 in \"Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics\" and Top 3 in both fields: \"Information Technology and Communication\" and \"Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction\".\n\nThe 2013–2014 Times Higher Education World University Rankings' Engineering and Technology table placing Lund University 78 around the world., in \"Art and Humanities\" 74th, in \"Clinical, Pre-clinical and Health\" 77th, in \"Life Sciences\" 67th, and in \"Physical Sciences\" 57th.\n\nThe 2015–2016 URAP (University Ranking by Academic Performance) placed to Lund University 87th in the world with qualification A++.\n\nThe 2015–16 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university in 90th place worldwide.\n\nStudent life \n\nLund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, the Academic Society (AF) and the student unions. Before July 1, 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation or AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory. Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.\n\nStudent nations \n\nThe nations in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as residential colleges for students, organized by geographic origin. Östgöta Nation, the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as student societies.\n\nToday students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.\n\nEach nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by Göteborgs Nation - called the \"Gustaf II Adolf Ball\" (also known as the \"GA-Ball\"). Most nations also host at least one banquet per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.\n\nThe Academic Society \n\nIn 1830, Professor Carl Adolph Agardh formed Akademiska Föreningen (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of \"developing and cultivating the academic life\" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. Prince Oscar, then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on AF-borgen (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the Main Building in Lundagård. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio (Radio AF), and organizing the enormous Lundakarnevalen (the Lund Carnival) every four years. \"AF Bostäder\", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska Föreningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.[http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ AF Bostäder History] \n\nStudent unions \n\nThe student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an additional union for doctoral students. Lund's Doctoral Student Union is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180431/http://93.182.167.71/nya-af/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/International.Guide_.2010_Web.pdf Studentlund, International Guide 2010]\n\nThe unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information. It also publishes the monthly Lundagård magazine.\n\nNotable people\n\nAlumni and faculty of Lund University are associated with, among other things: the creation of the first implantable pacemaker, the development of echocardiography, the spread of modern physiotherapy, the discovery of the role of dopamine as an independent neurotransmitter, the determination of the number of chromosomes of man, the establishment of osseointegration, the development of the Bluetooth technology, and the creation of the Rydberg formula.\n\nThe following is a selected list of some notable people who have been affiliated with Lund University as students or academics.\n\nHumanities and economics \n\nSamuel Pufendorf (1632–1694) was a notable jurist and philosopher known for his natural law theories, influencing Adam Smith  as well as Thomas Jefferson.

After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral.\n\nLund University has eight faculties, with additional campuses in the cities of Malmö and Helsingborg, with 42,000 students[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/facts-and-figures Facts and figures] Lund University web site. Retrieved 21 May 2017.  in 302 different programmes and 2,046 freestanding courses. The University has some 600 partner universities in over 70 countries and it belongs to the League of European Research Universities as well as the global Universitas 21 network.\n\nTwo major facilities for materials research are in Lund University: MAX IV, which is a world-leading synchrotron radiation laboratory – inaugurated in June 2016, and European Spallation Source (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be opened in 2023.[https://europeanspallationsource.se/ess-mandate ESS Mandate] Retrieved 21 May 2017.\n\nThe university centers on the Lundagård park adjacent to the Lund Cathedral, with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nHistory \n\nMedieval origins \n\nThe city of Lund has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the Katedralskolan) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school.\n\nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureus degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by studia generalia in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral.[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/a-brief-history A Brief History of Lund University] The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.\n\n17th–19th centuries \n\nAfter the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named Academia Carolina after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of Åbo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in Germany).\n\nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: law, theological, medicine and philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy.\n\nThe Scanian War in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the Lund Cathedral and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.\n\nIn 1713, Charles XII of Sweden entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for three years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was Andreas Rydelius.\n\nPeace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with Uppsala University, it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.\n\nAround 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor Esaias Tegnér was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student C. G. Brunius, who studied ancient languages under Tegnér and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.\n\nIn 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted Nordic student meetings together with the University of Copenhagen.\n\nA student called Elsa Collin was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a spex.\n\n20th century – present \n\nIn the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. Lund Institute of Technology was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.\n\nIn recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally[http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/UF0513_2009A01_BR_A40BR1002.pdf Utbildning Gymnasieungdomars studieintresse läsåret 2009/2010] and internationally. For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master's applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.\n\nWomen at the university\n\nThe first woman to study in Lund was Hildegard Björck (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in Uppsala and had there been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree. Her tenure in Lund was however very brief and the medical student Hedda Andersson who entered the university later in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so) is usually mentioned as the first woman at Lund University.[http://www.med.lu.se/plain/english/about_the_faculty/history_of_the_faculty/personalities_discoveries_and_innovations/hedda_andersson Lund University Medical Faculty] Hedda Andersson (1861-1950) Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor's chair was the historian Birgitta Odén (1965). In 1992 Boel Flodgren, Professor of Business Law, was appointed rector magnificus (or, strictly speaking, rectrix magnifica) of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be the head of a European university.\n\nCampus \n\nThe university's facilities are mainly located in the small city of Lund in Scania, about 15 km away from central Malmö and 50 km from Copenhagen. The university's prominence and large student population have much impact on the city, effectively making it a university town. Over a hundred university buildings[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/images/maps/2010campusmap.pdf - Campus map]  scatter around town, most of them in an area covering more than 1 km², stretching towards the north-east from Lundagård park in the very centre of town. Buildings in and around Lundagård include the main building, Kungshuset, the Historical Museum and the Academic Society's headquarters. The main library building is located in a park 400 meters to the north, followed by the large hospital complex.\n\nLund University has a satellite campus in nearby Malmö, Sweden's third largest city. The Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts' three academies: Malmö Art Academy, Malmö Academy of Music and Malmö Theatre Academy, are all located in Malmö. The city is also the location of Skåne University Hospital, where Lund University performs a considerable amount of research and medical training.\n\nCampus Helsingborg is, as the name suggests, located in the city of Helsingborg, almost 50 km from Lund. Opened in 2000, it consists of a building in the city centre, right next to the central train station and the harbour. Nearly 3,000 students are based on the campus.[http://www.ch.lu.se/index.php?id=235 Campus Helsingborg - about]  The Department of Service Management and the Department of Communication and Media are among those located at the campus in Helsingborg.\n\nTeaching and training at the School of Aviation (LUSA) takes place at an airfield next to the town of Ljungbyhed, about 40 km away from Lund.\n\nLibrary \n\nLund University library was established in 1668 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received legal deposit copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the Royal Library in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.Lund University library website, statistics for 2006, \nThe current main building at Helgonabacken opened in 1907. Before that, the old building was Liberiet close to the city's cathedral. Liberiet was built as a library in the 15th century, but now serves as a cafe.\n\nHospital \n\nEducation and research in the health sciences at the university is operated in cooperation with Skåne University Hospital, located in both Lund and Malmö. Medical education takes place in the Biomedical Centre, next to the hospital in Lund. Nursing and occupational therapy are taught in the Health Sciences Centre nearby. The university also operates the Clinical Research Centre in Malmö, featuring many specialized laboratories. There are over 100 faculty.\n\nOrganisation \n\nAdministration \n\nThe University Board is the University's highest decision-making body. The Board comprises the Vice-Chancellor, representatives of the teaching staff and students, and representatives of the community and business sector.[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about-lund-university/vice-chancellor-and-management/who-runs-the-university Lund University - Who Runs the University?]  Chair of the board is Margot Wallström. Executive power lies with the Vice-Chancellor and the University Management Group, to which most other administrative bodies are subordinate.\n\nFaculties \n\nLund University is divided into eight faculties:\n*Faculties of Humanities and Theology\n*Faculty of Engineering (LTH)\n*Faculty of Fine & Performing Arts\n*Faculty of Law\n*Faculty of Medicine\n*Faculty of Science\n*Faculty of Social Sciences\n*School of Economics and Management\n\nResearch centres \n\nThe university is also organised into more than 20 institutes and research centres, such as:\n\n*Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS)\n*Biomedical Centre\n*Centre for Biomechanics\n*Centre for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering - Kemicentrum\n*[http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund Centre for East and South-East Asian Studies]\n*Centre for European Studies\n*Centre for Geographical Information Systems (GIS Centrum)\n*Centre for Innovation, Research and Competence in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE)\n*Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University\n*Centre for Molecular Protein Science\n*Centre for Risk Analysis and Management (LUCRAM)\n*International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University (IIIEE)\n*Lund Functional Food Science Centre\n*Lund University Diabetes Centre (LUDC)\n*MAX lab - Accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation and nuclear physics research\n*Pufendorf Institute\n*Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\n*Swedish South Asian Studies Network\n\nAcademics \n\nEducation\n\nApproximately 42,000 students study within one of the 276 educational programs, the 100 international master's programmes or the 2,200 independent courses. Around five hundred courses are, or can be, held in English for the benefit of international exchange students. There are several programmes allowing foreign students to study abroad at the University. Notable exchangees include United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who spent time at Lund University in the 1960s conducting research.Linda, Bayer \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg\" (Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2000), 46. The university offers 9 out of the 20 most sought after programmes in Sweden. The master's programme in International Marketing is the most popular choice in the country, with almost a thousand applications yearly.\n\nResearch\n\nLund University is well known as one of Scandinavia's largest research universities.[http://www.euroscholars.eu/universities/lund.htm Lund University, Sweden] , Euro Scholars Website It ranks among top performers in the European Union in terms of papers accepted for publication in scientific journals.[ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/indicators/docs/3rd_report_snaps10.pdf The University Model for the 21st Century] It is one of Sweden's top receiver of research grants, most of which come from government-funded bodies.

Lund was ranked 60th in the world in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings. In 2015, it ranked  90th in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, it was in the 101-150 category. \nIn the Leiden Ranking for 2017, Lund University is ranked 84th in the world.\n\nIn 2014, the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, Ecuador (Senescyt), as a parameter for awarding scholarships, created a list of top Universities around the world placing Lund University in Top 1 in \"Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics\" and Top 3 in both fields: \"Information Technology and Communication\" and \"Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction\".\n\nThe 2013–2014 Times Higher Education World University Rankings' Engineering and Technology table placing Lund University 78 around the world., in \"Art and Humanities\" 74th, in \"Clinical, Pre-clinical and Health\" 77th, in \"Life Sciences\" 67th, and in \"Physical Sciences\" 57th.\n\nThe 2015–2016 URAP (University Ranking by Academic Performance) placed to Lund University 87th in the world with qualification A++.\n\nThe 2015–16 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university in 90th place worldwide.\n\nStudent life \n\nLund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, the Academic Society (AF) and the student unions. Before July 1, 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation or AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory. Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.\n\nStudent nations \n\nThe nations in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as residential colleges for students, organized by geographic origin. Östgöta Nation, the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as student societies.\n\nToday students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.\n\nEach nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by Göteborgs Nation - called the \"Gustaf II Adolf Ball\" (also known as the \"GA-Ball\"). Most nations also host at least one banquet per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.\n\nThe Academic Society \n\nIn 1830, Professor Carl Adolph Agardh formed Akademiska Föreningen (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of \"developing and cultivating the academic life\" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. Prince Oscar, then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on AF-borgen (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the Main Building in Lundagård. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio (Radio AF), and organizing the enormous Lundakarnevalen (the Lund Carnival) every four years. \"AF Bostäder\", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska Föreningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.[http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ AF Bostäder History] \n\nStudent unions \n\nThe student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an additional union for doctoral students. Lund's Doctoral Student Union is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180431/http://93.182.167.71/nya-af/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/International.Guide_.2010_Web.pdf Studentlund, International Guide 2010]\n\nThe unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information. It also publishes the monthly Lundagård magazine.\n\nNotable people\n\nAlumni and faculty of Lund University are associated with, among other things: the creation of the first implantable pacemaker, the development of echocardiography, the spread of modern physiotherapy, the discovery of the role of dopamine as an independent neurotransmitter, the determination of the number of chromosomes of man, the establishment of osseointegration, the development of the Bluetooth technology, and the creation of the Rydberg formula.\n\nThe following is a selected list of some notable people who have been affiliated with Lund University as students or academics.\n\nHumanities and economics \n\nSamuel Pufendorf (1632–1694) was a notable jurist and philosopher known for his natural law theories, influencing Adam Smith  as well as Thomas Jefferson.
