There were small populations of Greek-speaking Muslims and Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox.A Handbook of Cyprus, Hutchinson, Joseph Turner, page 57, 1907\n\nIn total, between 1955 and 1973, 16,519 Turks and 71,036 Greeks emigrated from the country. Of the emigrated Turkish Cypriots in this period, only 290 went to Turkey.\n\nImmigration\n\nLarge-scale demographic changes have been caused since 1964 by the movements of peoples across the island and the later influx of settlers from Turkey to Northern Cyprus. According to the 2011 Census there are 170,383 non-citizens living in Cyprus, of whom 106,270 are EU citizens and 64,113 are from third countries. The largest EU groups by nationality are Greeks (29,321), British (24,046), Romanians (23,706) and Bulgarians (18,536). The largest non-EU groups are Filipinos (9,413), Russians (8,164), Sri Lankans (7,269) and Vietnamese (7,028). There are an estimated 20–25,000 undocumented migrants from third countries also living in the Republic, though migrant rights groups dispute these figures.http://cms.horus.be/files/99907/MediaArchive/Events/Study_Visits/KISA%20Intervention.pdf The demographic changes in society have led to some racist incidents,[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id43171 \"My girl thought she was going to die\"] [http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id\n34878&cat_id1 \"Why the Republic of Cyprus is institutionally racist\"] [http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id\n44660 \"Teen says beaten and mocked by police in racist incident\"] and the formation of the charity KISA in response.\n\nThe demographic character of Northern Cyprus changed after the Turkish invasion in 1974 and especially during the last 10–15 years. The TRNC census carried out in April 2006 showed that out of a total population of 256,644 in Northern Cyprus, 132,635, or 52%, were Turkish Cypriots in the sense that they were born in Cyprus of at least one Cyprus-born parent (for 120,007 of these both parents were Cyprus-born). In addition, 43,062 TRNC citizens (17%) had at least one non-Cypriot Turkish-born parent, 2,334 TRNC citizens (1%) had parents born in other countries, 70,525 residents (27%) had Turkish citizenship, and 8,088 (3%) were citizens of other countries (mainly UK, Bulgaria, and Iran).\n\nBased on these census data, it is estimated that 113,687 TRNC residents, or 44% of the population, are not Turkish Cypriots properly speaking, but are in fact \"Turkish immigrants\" or \"Turkish settlers\" from Anatolia. Alternative sources suggest that there are 146,122 Turkish settlers from Anatolia in TRNC (2007 figures)[http://www.calisma.gov.tr/ Çalışma Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanlığı]  and that the Turkish Cypriots in Northern Cyprus are today outnumbered by the Turkish settlers,The Turkish Settlers in Northern Cyprus, www.cyprus-conflict.net, quoting \"Fresh Tension for Cyprus: Counting the Newcomers\" in The New York Times, January 23, 1991. contrary to the picture presented by the 2006 TRNC census.\n\nAlmost one-third of the Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus have been granted TRNC citizenship by the authorities of Northern Cyprus and have thus been naturalized.[http://www.zaman.com/?blhotnews&alt\n&trh20060506&hn\n32847 Today's Zaman]  The Republic of Cyprus regards settlement in Northern Cyprus, especially if accompanied by naturalization, as a violation of the Geneva Conventions Protocol of 1977, since the Turkish occupation has been declared illegal by the UN. It therefore considers these Turkish immigrants to be \"illegal settlers\" and does not include them in the population estimates for the entire island published by the Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service.\n\nEmigration\n\nEthnic groups \n\n*Greek 98.8%,\n*Other 1% (includes Maronite, Armenian, Turkish-Cypriot)\n*Uspecified 0.2%\n\nLanguages\n\n \nGreek and Turkish are the official languages according to Article 3 of the Constitution of Cyprus. In Northern Cyprus, the official language is Turkish (Article 2 of the 1983 Constitution of Northern Cyprus). English is widely spoken on the island, and Russian has become fairly widespread in recent years due to the influx of immigrants and investors from CIS countries.\n\nReligion\n\nThe Greek Cypriot community adheres to the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community adheres to Islam. The religious groups of Armenians, Maronites and Latins (about 9,000 people in total) opted, in accordance with the 1960 constitution, to belong to the Greek Cypriot community.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census carried out in the Government controlled area, 98.2% of the population are Christians of various denominations. 94.8% of the population are Christian Orthodox, 0.9% Armenians and Maronites, 1.5% Roman Catholics (\"Latins\"), 1.0% Church of England, and 0.6% Muslims. The remaining 1.3% adhere to other religious denominations or did not state their religion. Cyprus is also the home of a Jewish community with a Synagogue in Larnaca.\n\nEducation\n\nCyprus has a well-developed system of primary and secondary education. The majority of Cypriots earn their higher education at Greek, British, or American universities, while there are also sizeable emigrant communities in the United Kingdom and Australia. Private colleges and state-supported universities have been developed by both the Turkish and Greek communities.\n\nDemographic statistics\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html#People CIA – The World Factbook – Cyprus]\n\nThe data in subsections Age structure through Divorce rate are for the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus government only.
