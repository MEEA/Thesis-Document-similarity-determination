  "textBody" : "Apollos () was a 1st century Alexandrian Jewish Christian mentioned several times in the New Testament. A contemporary and co-worker of Paul the Apostle, he played an important role in the early development of the churches of Ephesus and Corinth.\n\nBiblical account\n\nActs of the Apostles\n\nApollos is first mentioned as a Christian preacher who had come to Ephesus (probably in the year 52 or 53), where he is described as \"being fervent in spirit: he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John\" (). Priscilla and Aquila, a Jewish Christian couple who had come to Ephesus with the Apostle Paul, instructed Apollos:\n\n\"When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more adequately.\"\n\nThe differences between the two understandings probably related to baptism with the Holy Spirit, since Apollos \"knew only the baptism of John\". Later, during Apollos' absence, the writer of the Acts of the Apostles recounts an encounter between Paul and some disciples at Ephesus:\n\nBefore Paul's arrival, Apollos had moved from Ephesus to Achaia So the Alexandrian recension; the text in \\mathfrak{P}38 and Codex Bezae indicate that Apollos went to Corinth. Joseph Fitzmyer, The Acts of the Apostles (New York: Doubleday, 1998), p. 639. and was living in Corinth, the provincial capital of Achaia. Acts reports that Apollos arrived in Achaia with a letter of recommendation from the Ephesian Christians and \"greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus ().\n\n1 Corinthians\n\nPaul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (55 AD) mentions Apollos as an important figure at Corinth. Paul describes Apollos' role at Corinth:\nI planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. ()\nPaul's Epistle refers to a schism between four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were Peter, identified as Cephas, and Jesus Christ himself). It is possible, though, that, as Msgr. Ronald Knox suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow Paul, the other claiming to follow Apollos. \"It is surely probable that the adherents of St. Paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the Apostolic College. Hence 'I am for Cephas'. [...] What reply was the faction of Apollos to make? It devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the Apostolic College itself to him from whom the Apostolic College derived its dignity; 'I am for Christ.'\"Knox, R. Enthusiasm, p. 13. Paul states that the schism arose because of the Corinthians' immaturity in faith ().\n\nApollos was a devout Jew born in Alexandria.
