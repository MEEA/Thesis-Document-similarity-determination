Although he never abandoned painting, Marini devoted himself primarily to sculpture from about 1922. From this time his work was influenced by Etruscan art and the sculpture of Arturo Martini. Marini succeeded Martini as professor at the Scuola d’Arte di Villa Reale in Monza, near Milan, in 1929, a position he retained until 1940.\n\nDuring this period, Marini traveled frequently to Paris, where he associated with Massimo Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Magnelli, and Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis. In 1936 he moved to Tenero-Locarno, in Ticino Canton, Switzerland; during the following few years the artist often visited Zürich and Basel, where he became a friend of Alberto Giacometti, Germaine Richier, and Fritz Wotruba. In 1936, he received the Prize of the Quadriennale of Rome. In 1938, he married Mercedes Pedrazzini.[http://www.museomarinomarini.it/section.php?page\nfondazione] Fondazione (Italian/needs interpretation) -Accessed 2011-04-15\nHe accepted a professorship in sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, Milan, in 1940.\n\nIn 1943, he went into exile in Switzerland, exhibiting in Basel, Bern, and Zurich.\nIn 1946, the artist settled permanently in Milan.\n\nHe is buried at Cimitero Comunale of Pistoia, Toscana, Italy.\n\nCareer\n\nHe participated in the 'Twentieth-Century Italian Art' show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1944. Curt Valentin began exhibiting Marini’s work at his Buchholz Gallery in New York in 1950, on which occasion the sculptor visited the city and met Jean Arp, Max Beckmann, Alexander Calder, Lyonel Feininger, and Jacques Lipchitz. On his return to Europe, he stopped in London, where the Hanover Gallery had organized a solo show of his work, and there met Henry Moore. In 1951 a Marini exhibition traveled from the Kestner-Gesellschaft Hannover to the Kunstverein in Hamburg and the Haus der Kunst of Munich. He was awarded the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 1952 and the Feltrinelli Prize at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome in 1954.

An example, in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, is \"The Angel of the City,\" depicting \"affirmation and charged strength associated explicitly with sexual potency.\" In later works, the rider is, increasingly, oblivious of his mount, \"involved in his own visions or anxieties.\" In the artist's final work, the rider is unseated as the horse falls to the ground in an \"apocalyptic image of lost control\" which parallels Marini’s growing despair for the future of the world.",
