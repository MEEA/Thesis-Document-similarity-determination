The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true. For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that \"it's raining and I'm inside\".
