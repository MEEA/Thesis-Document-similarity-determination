  "textBody" : "The Armed Forces of El Salvador () are the official military of El Salvador. The military consists of three branches, the Salvadoran Army, the Air Force of El Salvador and the Navy of El Salvador.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Armed Forces of El Salvador have existed since the dissolution of the United Provinces of Central America (in 1840).\n\nFootball War \n\nIn 1969, following El Salvador's accusation that Honduras had committed genocide, the two countries went to war. The immediate spark of the war was a game of football, which is why the war became known as the Football War. On July 14, 1969, the El Salvador Air Force attacked several Honduran airbases. Honduras was caught by surprise, so their armed forces didn't respond immediately. El Salvador's forces, which had already assembled at the Honduran border, proceeded to invade. The Honduran Army was pushed back around 8 kilometers into their country due to intense artillery fire. Ocotepeque fell, and the Salvadoran flag was raised in the city. This was the first time El Salvador had done this.\n\nOn July 16, Honduran fighter pilots, flying American-built F-4 Corsairs, intercepted and defeated Salvadoran air forces equipped with P-51 Mustangs, in the last piston-engine aircraft dogfight in world history. Even though Honduras had won a battle against the Salvadoran Air Force, Honduras had to ask for a ceasefire because the Salvadoran ground forces were preparing to surround Tegucigalpa, the country's capital city. Thus the war ended after 4 days of intense fighting. El Salvador declared itself the winner, having penetrated into Honduras and successfully reached Tegucigalpa. The success of El Salvador could be attributed to weeks of training and organizing of their forces in secret. There were 4 ground theaters, an air theater, and a small navy unit in the Gulf of Fonseca. The North Theater was composed of ground forces, mostly infantry, artillery and armored units. The Chalatenango Theater prepared for a possible Honduran penetration into the country and was largely unused. The East Theater advanced into Honduras with armored and artillery support. This theater saw much of the fighting leading to Tegucigalpa and used the highest amount of ammunition. The air theater was promising for El Salvador at the beginning, but was crushed by the Honduran Air Force. The El Salvador Navy was in a position only to support troops in the coast and to attack any passing-by airplanes therefore did not see much fighting.\n\nCivil War \n\nDuring the Salvadoran Civil War the Armed Forces of El Salvador waged war against counter-insurgents organized under the FMLN.  Following the end of the war, AFES personnel were implicated in many human rights abuses, including the November 1989 murder of Jesuit priests and others.  In accordance with the peace agreements, the constitution was amended to prohibit the military from playing an internal security role except under extraordinary circumstances. \n\nThe Treasury Police and National Guard were abolished, and military intelligence functions were transferred to civilian control. In 1993, the military had cut personnel from a wartime high of 63,000 to the level of 32,000 required by the peace accords. A purge of military officers accused of human rights abuses and corruption was completed in 1993 in compliance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendations.\n\nPost-war \n\nIn 1999, ESAF strength stood at less than 15,000, including uniformed and non-uniformed personnel, consisting of personnel in the army, navy, and air force. \n\nEl Salvador was part of the Multi-National Force – Iraq from 2003—2009.
