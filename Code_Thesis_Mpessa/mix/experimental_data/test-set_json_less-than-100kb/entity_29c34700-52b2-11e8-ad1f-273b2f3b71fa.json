  "textBody" : "Kainite ( or) (KMg(SO4)Cl·3H2O) is an evaporite mineral in the class of \"Sulfates (selenates, etc.) with additional anions, with H2O\" according to the Nickel-Strunz classification. It is a hydrated potassium-magnesium sulfate-chloride, naturally occurring in irregular granular masses or as crystalline coatings in cavities or fissures. This mineral is dull and soft, and is colored white, yellowish, grey, reddish, or blue to violet.
