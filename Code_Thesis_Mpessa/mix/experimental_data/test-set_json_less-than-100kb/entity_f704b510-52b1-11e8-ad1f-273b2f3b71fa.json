  "textBody" : "The Fagales are an order of flowering plants, including some of the best-known trees.  The order name is derived from genus Fagus, beeches.  They belong among the rosid group of dicotyledons.

The other families were split into three different orders, placed among the Hamamelidae.  The Casuarinales comprised the single family Casuarinaceae, the Juglandales comprised the Juglandaceae and Rhoipteleaceae, and the Myricales comprised the remaining forms (plus Balanops).
