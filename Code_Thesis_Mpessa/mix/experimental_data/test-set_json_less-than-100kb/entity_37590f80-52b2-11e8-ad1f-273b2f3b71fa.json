She won five Grand Slam singles titles, thirteen Grand Slam women's doubles titles, winning a calendar-year doubles Grand Slam in 1998, and seven Grand Slam mixed doubles titles; for a combined total of twenty-five major titles. In addition, she won the season-ending WTA Finals two times in singles and three times in doubles, and an Olympic silver medal. \n\nHingis set a series of \"youngest-ever\" records during the 1990s, including youngest-ever Grand Slam champion and youngest-ever world No. 1. Before ligament injuries in both ankles forced her to withdraw temporarily from professional tennis in 2002, at the age of 22, she had won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles titles and, according to Forbes, had been the highest-paid female athlete in the world for five consecutive years, 1997 to 2001. After several surgeries and long recuperations, Hingis returned to the WTA tour in 2006, climbing to world No. 6, winning two Tier I tournaments, and also receiving the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year. She retired in November 2007, after being hampered by a hip injury for several months and testing positive for a metabolite of cocaine during the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, which led to a two-year suspension from the sport.\n\nIn July 2013, Hingis came out of retirement to play the tournaments of the North American hard-court season alongside Daniela Hantuchová. During her doubles comeback, Hingis won four Grand Slam women's doubles tournaments, six Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments, and a silver medal partnering her compatriot Timea Bacsinszky at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Hingis retired after the 2017 WTA Finals while ranked world No. 1. \n\nWidely considered an all-time tennis great, Hingis was ranked by Tennis magazine in 2005 as the 8th-greatest female player of the preceding 40 years. She was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by TIME in June 2011. In 2013, Hingis was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and was appointed two years later the organization's first ever Global Ambassador.[https://www.tennisfame.com/blog/2015/6/martina-hingis-named-global-ambassador-for-the-international-tennis-hall-of-fame/ Martina Hingis named Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame.] Retrieved on 2015-09-11.\n\nChildhood and early career\n\nHingis was born in Košice, Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia) as Martina Hingisová Molitor, to accomplished tennis players Melanie Molitorová and Karol Hingis. Molitorová was a professional tennis player who was once ranked tenth among women in Czechoslovakia, and was determined to develop Hingis into a top player as early as pregnancy. Her father was ranked as high as nineteenth in the Czechoslovak tennis rankings. Martina Hingis spent her early childhood growing up in the town of Rožnov (now in Czech Republic). Hingis's parents divorced when she was six, and she and her mother defected from Czechoslovakia in 1987 and emigrated to Trübbach (Wartau) in Switzerland when she was seven. Her mother remarried, to a Swiss man, Andreas Zogg, a computer technician. Martina Hingis acquired Swiss citizenship through naturalization.\n\nHingis began playing tennis when she was two years old and entered her first tournament at age four. In 1993, 12-year-old Hingis became the youngest player to win a Grand Slam junior title: the girls' singles at the French Open. In 1994, she retained her French Open junior title, won the girls' singles title at Wimbledon, and reached the final of the US Open.\n\nShe made her WTA debut at the Zurich Open in October 1994, two weeks after turning 14, and ended 1994 ranked World no. 87.\n\nGrand Slam success and period of dominance\n\n1996\n\nIn 1996, Hingis became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time, when she teamed with Helena Suková at Wimbledon to win the women's doubles title at age 15 years and 9 months. She also won her first professional singles title that year at Filderstadt, Germany. She reached the singles quarterfinals of the 1996 Australian Open and the singles semifinals of the 1996 US Open. Following her win at Filderstadt, Hingis defeated the reigning Australian Open champion and co-top ranked (with Steffi Graf) Monica Seles in the final in Oakland, but lost to Graf in the year-end WTA Tour Championships final in five sets.\n\n1997\n\nIn 1997, Hingis became the undisputed World No. 1 women's tennis player. She started the year by winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. She then became the youngest Grand Slam singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at age 16 years and 3 months (beating former champion Mary Pierce in the final). In March, she became the youngest top ranked player in history. In July, she became the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since Lottie Dod in 1887 by beating Jana Novotná in the final. She then defeated another up-and-coming player, Venus Williams, in the final of the US Open. The only Grand Slam singles title that Hingis failed to win in 1997 was the French Open, where she lost in the final to Iva Majoli. She won the Australian Open women's doubles with Natasha Zvereva.\n\n1998\n\nIn 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women's doubles titles, only the fourth in women's tennis history to do so,[http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/martinahingis_trivia1.html Martina Hingis News and Trivias at] .

(the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić and the other three events with Novotná), and she became only the third woman to hold the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles simultaneously. She also retained her Australian Open singles title by beating Conchita Martínez in straight sets in the final. Hingis, however, lost in the final of the US Open to Lindsay Davenport. Davenport ended an 80-week stretch Hingis had enjoyed as the No. 1 singles player in October 1998, but Hingis finished the year by beating Davenport in the final of the WTA Tour Championships.\n\n1999\n\n1999 saw Hingis win her third successive Australian Open singles crown as well as the doubles title (with Anna Kournikova). She had dropped her former doubles partner Jana Novotná.[http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/5107/ Riot Girls], Chris Smith, New York Magazine\nShe then reached the French Open final and was three points away from victory in the second set before losing to Steffi Graf about whom she had said before: \"Steffi had some results in the past, but it's a faster, more athletic game now... She is old now. Her time has passed.\" She broke into tears after a game in which the crowd had booed her for using underhand serves and crossing the line in a discussion about an umpire decision.[http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/YB08_hingis.html Say it ain’t so] , Bill Simons, Inside Tennis After a shock first-round, straight set, loss to Jelena Dokić at Wimbledon, Hingis bounced back to reach her third consecutive US Open final, where she lost to 17-year-old Serena Williams. Hingis won a total of seven singles titles that year and reclaimed the No. 1 singles ranking. She also reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.\n\n2000\n\nIn 2000, Hingis again found herself in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles championship ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis captured the French Open women's doubles title with Pierce and produced consistent results in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.\n\nInjuries and first retirement from tennis\n\n2001\n\nIn 2001, Switzerland, with Hingis and Roger Federer on its team, won the Hopman Cup. Hingis didn't drop a set in any of her singles matches during the event, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn, Nicole Pratt, Amanda Coetzer, and Monica Seles. Federer was later quoted as saying: \"I learned a lot from her, especially the two years I was here - once as a hitting partner and once as a partner with Martina. Definitely she helped me to become the player I am today.\"\n\nHingis reached her fifth consecutive Australian Open final in 2001, defeating both of the Williams sisters en route, before losing to Jennifer Capriati. She briefly ended her coaching relationship with her mother Melanie early in the year but had a change of heart two months later just before the French Open. 2001 was her least successful year in several seasons, with only three tournament victories in total. She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.\n\n2002\n\nComing back from injury, Hingis won the Australian Open doubles final at the start of 2002 (again teaming with Anna Kournikova) and reached a sixth straight Australian Open final in singles, again facing Capriati. Hingis led by a set and 4–0 and had four match points but lost in three sets. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.\n\n2003\n\nIn February 2003, at the age of 22, Hingis announced her retirement from tennis, due to her injuries and being in pain. \"I want to play tennis only for fun and concentrate more on horse riding and finish my studies.\" In several interviews, she has indicated she wishes to return to her home country and coach full-time.\n\nDuring this segment of her tennis career, Hingis won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles events. She held the World No. 1 singles ranking for a total of 209 weeks (fifth most following Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova (after whom she was named), Chris Evert, and Serena Williams). In 2005, Tennis magazine put her in 22nd place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS era.\n\nReturn to the game\n\n2005\n\nIn February 2005, Hingis made an unsuccessful return to competition at an event in Pattaya, Thailand, where she lost to Germany's Marlene Weingärtner in the first round. After the loss, she claimed that she had no further plans for a comeback.\n\nHingis, however, resurfaced in July, playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in World Team Tennis and notching up singles victories over two top 100 players and shutting out Martina Navratilova in singles on 7 July. With these promising results behind her, Hingis announced on 29 November her return to the WTA Tour in 2006.\n\n2006\n\nAt the Australian Open, Hingis lost in the quarterfinals to second-seeded Kim Clijsters. However, Hingis won the mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi of India. This was her first career Grand Slam mixed doubles title and fifteenth overall (5 singles, 9 women's doubles, 1 mixed doubles).\n\nThe week after the Australian Open, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Maria Sharapova in the semifinals of the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo before losing in the final to World No. 9 Elena Dementieva. Hingis competed in Dubai then, reaching the quarter-finals before falling to Sharapova. At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round before again losing to Sharapova in the semifinals.\n\nAt the Tier I Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, Hingis posted her 500th career singles match victory in the quarterfinals, beating World No. 18 Flavia Pennetta, and subsequently won the tournament with wins over Venus Williams in the semifinals and Dinara Safina in the final. This was her 41st Women's Tennis Association tour singles title and first in more than four years. Hingis then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Kim Clijsters.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Hingis lost in the third round to Ai Sugiyama.\n\nHingis's return to the US Open was short lived, as she was upset in the second round by World No. 112 Virginie Razzano of France.\n\nIn her first tournament after the US Open, Hingis won the second title of her comeback at the Tier III Sunfeast Open in Kolkata, India. She defeated unseeded Russian Olga Puchkova in the final.

Hingis also ranked as number 7 on the Annual Top Google News Searches in 2006.[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/google-zeitgeist-highlights-2006-searches/ Google Zeitgeist Highlights 2006 Searches].

Hingis then lost a quarterfinal match to Kim Clijsters. This was the second consecutive year that Hingis had lost to Clijsters in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the third time in the last five Grand Slam tournaments that Clijsters had eliminated Hingis in the quarterfinals.\n\nHingis won her next tournament, the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, defeating Ana Ivanovic in the final. This was Hingis's record fifth singles title at this event.\n\nA hip injury that troubled her at the German Open caused her to withdraw from the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where she was the defending champion, and the French Open, the only important singles title that eluded her.\n\nIn her first round match at Wimbledon, Hingis saved two match points to defeat British wildcard Naomi Cavaday, apparently not having fully recovered from the hip injury that prevented her from playing the French Open. In the third round, Hingis lost to Laura Granville of the United States, and stated afterwards she should not have entered the tournament.\n\nHingis's next tournament was the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, in which Hingis lost in the third round to Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka. Hingis did not play any tournaments after the China Open, as she was beset by injuries for the rest of the year.\n\nITF suspension and second retirement \n\nIn November 2007, Hingis called a press conference to announce that she was under investigation for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, during a urine test taken by players at Wimbledon. Hingis' urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of benzoylecgonine. The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter states that \"the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml.\" As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.\n\n2008–09\n\nHaving retired for the second time in 2007, Hingis played an exhibition match at the Liverpool International tournament on 13 June 2008. Although this event was a warm-up for Wimbledon, it was not part of the WTA Tour. In a rematch of their 1997 Wimbledon final, Hingis defeated Jana Novotná.\n\nIn 2009, Hingis took part in the British television dancing competition Strictly Come Dancing.

At Eastbourne, they won after defeating Barty and Dellacqua 6–3, 7–5 in the final. However, like the French Open two months previous, Hingis and Chan could not replicate the success at Grand Slam level: losing at the quarter-final stage to Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Květa Peschke at Wimbledon. In the mixed doubles competition, Hingis paired up with new partner Great Britain's Jamie Murray after splitting from Paes. As top seeds they reached the final without losing a set, before defeating defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen 6–4, 6–4 in the championship match.\n\nHingis and Chan next played at the Canadian Open, where the German-Czech pair of Grönefeld and Peschke defeated them for the second tournament in a row in the quarter-finals. However, not to be deterred, a week later at the Cincinnati Open they produced another winning run and defeated Hsieh and Niculescu 4–6, 6–4, [10–7] in the final to capture their next title together. On the 14 August, Hingis and Chan became one of the first teams to qualify for the doubles competition at the year-end WTA Finals.\n\nAt the US Open, Hingis emerged victorious from both the women's and the mixed doubles competition. Murray and she defeated Chan Hao-ching and Michael Venus 6–1, 4–6, [10–8] in the final to capture their second consecutive title together and remain undefeated as a pair. Then, less than 24 hours later with Chan, they defeated Hradecká and Siniaková 6–3, 6–2 in the final to win their first major title together. In total, this was Hingis' 25th Grand Slam title across all disciplines.\n\nHingis and Chan extended their winning run to 18 matches in China by winning their third and fourth straight titles: the Wuhan and China Opens. In Wuhan, they defeated Shuko Aoyama and Yang Zhaoxuan 7–6(7–5), 3–6, [10–4] in the final. With this win Hingis ascended to the No.1 ranking on 2 October for the 67th week in her career.

She won five Grand Slam singles titles, thirteen Grand Slam women's doubles titles, winning a calendar-year doubles Grand Slam in 1998, and seven Grand Slam mixed doubles titles; for a combined total of twenty-five major titles. In addition, she won the season-ending WTA Finals two times in singles and three times in doubles, and an Olympic silver medal. \n\nHingis set a series of \"youngest-ever\" records during the 1990s, including youngest-ever Grand Slam champion and youngest-ever world No. 1. Before ligament injuries in both ankles forced her to withdraw temporarily from professional tennis in 2002, at the age of 22, she had won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles titles and, according to Forbes, had been the highest-paid female athlete in the world for five consecutive years, 1997 to 2001. After several surgeries and long recuperations, Hingis returned to the WTA tour in 2006, climbing to world No. 6, winning two Tier I tournaments, and also receiving the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year. She retired in November 2007, after being hampered by a hip injury for several months and testing positive for a metabolite of cocaine during the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, which led to a two-year suspension from the sport.\n\nIn July 2013, Hingis came out of retirement to play the tournaments of the North American hard-court season alongside Daniela Hantuchová. During her doubles comeback, Hingis won four Grand Slam women's doubles tournaments, six Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments, and a silver medal partnering her compatriot Timea Bacsinszky at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Hingis retired after the 2017 WTA Finals while ranked world No. 1. \n\nWidely considered an all-time tennis great, Hingis was ranked by Tennis magazine in 2005 as the 8th-greatest female player of the preceding 40 years. She was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by TIME in June 2011. In 2013, Hingis was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and was appointed two years later the organization's first ever Global Ambassador.[https://www.tennisfame.com/blog/2015/6/martina-hingis-named-global-ambassador-for-the-international-tennis-hall-of-fame/ Martina Hingis named Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame.] Retrieved on 2015-09-11.\n\nChildhood and early career\n\nHingis was born in Košice, Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia) as Martina Hingisová Molitor, to accomplished tennis players Melanie Molitorová and Karol Hingis. Molitorová was a professional tennis player who was once ranked tenth among women in Czechoslovakia, and was determined to develop Hingis into a top player as early as pregnancy. Her father was ranked as high as nineteenth in the Czechoslovak tennis rankings. Martina Hingis spent her early childhood growing up in the town of Rožnov (now in Czech Republic). Hingis's parents divorced when she was six, and she and her mother defected from Czechoslovakia in 1987 and emigrated to Trübbach (Wartau) in Switzerland when she was seven. Her mother remarried, to a Swiss man, Andreas Zogg, a computer technician. Martina Hingis acquired Swiss citizenship through naturalization.\n\nHingis began playing tennis when she was two years old and entered her first tournament at age four. In 1993, 12-year-old Hingis became the youngest player to win a Grand Slam junior title: the girls' singles at the French Open. In 1994, she retained her French Open junior title, won the girls' singles title at Wimbledon, and reached the final of the US Open.\n\nShe made her WTA debut at the Zurich Open in October 1994, two weeks after turning 14, and ended 1994 ranked World no. 87.\n\nGrand Slam success and period of dominance\n\n1996\n\nIn 1996, Hingis became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time, when she teamed with Helena Suková at Wimbledon to win the women's doubles title at age 15 years and 9 months. She also won her first professional singles title that year at Filderstadt, Germany. She reached the singles quarterfinals of the 1996 Australian Open and the singles semifinals of the 1996 US Open. Following her win at Filderstadt, Hingis defeated the reigning Australian Open champion and co-top ranked (with Steffi Graf) Monica Seles in the final in Oakland, but lost to Graf in the year-end WTA Tour Championships final in five sets.\n\n1997\n\nIn 1997, Hingis became the undisputed World No. 1 women's tennis player. She started the year by winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. She then became the youngest Grand Slam singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at age 16 years and 3 months (beating former champion Mary Pierce in the final). In March, she became the youngest top ranked player in history. In July, she became the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since Lottie Dod in 1887 by beating Jana Novotná in the final. She then defeated another up-and-coming player, Venus Williams, in the final of the US Open. The only Grand Slam singles title that Hingis failed to win in 1997 was the French Open, where she lost in the final to Iva Majoli. She won the Australian Open women's doubles with Natasha Zvereva.\n\n1998\n\nIn 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women's doubles titles, only the fourth in women's tennis history to do so,[http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/martinahingis_trivia1.html Martina Hingis News and Trivias at] .

(the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić and the other three events with Novotná), and she became only the third woman to hold the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles simultaneously. She also retained her Australian Open singles title by beating Conchita Martínez in straight sets in the final. Hingis, however, lost in the final of the US Open to Lindsay Davenport. Davenport ended an 80-week stretch Hingis had enjoyed as the No. 1 singles player in October 1998, but Hingis finished the year by beating Davenport in the final of the WTA Tour Championships.\n\n1999\n\n1999 saw Hingis win her third successive Australian Open singles crown as well as the doubles title (with Anna Kournikova). She had dropped her former doubles partner Jana Novotná.[http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/5107/ Riot Girls], Chris Smith, New York Magazine\nShe then reached the French Open final and was three points away from victory in the second set before losing to Steffi Graf about whom she had said before: \"Steffi had some results in the past, but it's a faster, more athletic game now... She is old now. Her time has passed.\" She broke into tears after a game in which the crowd had booed her for using underhand serves and crossing the line in a discussion about an umpire decision.[http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/YB08_hingis.html Say it ain’t so] , Bill Simons, Inside Tennis After a shock first-round, straight set, loss to Jelena Dokić at Wimbledon, Hingis bounced back to reach her third consecutive US Open final, where she lost to 17-year-old Serena Williams. Hingis won a total of seven singles titles that year and reclaimed the No. 1 singles ranking. She also reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.\n\n2000\n\nIn 2000, Hingis again found herself in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles championship ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis captured the French Open women's doubles title with Pierce and produced consistent results in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.\n\nInjuries and first retirement from tennis\n\n2001\n\nIn 2001, Switzerland, with Hingis and Roger Federer on its team, won the Hopman Cup. Hingis didn't drop a set in any of her singles matches during the event, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn, Nicole Pratt, Amanda Coetzer, and Monica Seles. Federer was later quoted as saying: \"I learned a lot from her, especially the two years I was here - once as a hitting partner and once as a partner with Martina. Definitely she helped me to become the player I am today.\"\n\nHingis reached her fifth consecutive Australian Open final in 2001, defeating both of the Williams sisters en route, before losing to Jennifer Capriati.

Hingis led by a set and 4–0 and had four match points but lost in three sets. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.\n\n2003\n\nIn February 2003, at the age of 22, Hingis announced her retirement from tennis, due to her injuries and being in pain. \"I want to play tennis only for fun and concentrate more on horse riding and finish my studies.\" In several interviews, she has indicated she wishes to return to her home country and coach full-time.\n\nDuring this segment of her tennis career, Hingis won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles events. She held the World No. 1 singles ranking for a total of 209 weeks (fifth most following Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova (after whom she was named), Chris Evert, and Serena Williams). In 2005, Tennis magazine put her in 22nd place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS era.\n\nReturn to the game\n\n2005\n\nIn February 2005, Hingis made an unsuccessful return to competition at an event in Pattaya, Thailand, where she lost to Germany's Marlene Weingärtner in the first round. After the loss, she claimed that she had no further plans for a comeback.\n\nHingis, however, resurfaced in July, playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in World Team Tennis and notching up singles victories over two top 100 players and shutting out Martina Navratilova in singles on 7 July. With these promising results behind her, Hingis announced on 29 November her return to the WTA Tour in 2006.\n\n2006\n\nAt the Australian Open, Hingis lost in the quarterfinals to second-seeded Kim Clijsters. However, Hingis won the mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi of India. This was her first career Grand Slam mixed doubles title and fifteenth overall (5 singles, 9 women's doubles, 1 mixed doubles).\n\nThe week after the Australian Open, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Maria Sharapova in the semifinals of the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo before losing in the final to World No. 9 Elena Dementieva.

At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round before again losing to Sharapova in the semifinals.\n\nAt the Tier I Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, Hingis posted her 500th career singles match victory in the quarterfinals, beating World No. 18 Flavia Pennetta, and subsequently won the tournament with wins over Venus Williams in the semifinals and Dinara Safina in the final. This was her 41st Women's Tennis Association tour singles title and first in more than four years. Hingis then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Kim Clijsters.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Hingis lost in the third round to Ai Sugiyama.\n\nHingis's return to the US Open was short lived, as she was upset in the second round by World No. 112 Virginie Razzano of France.\n\nIn her first tournament after the US Open, Hingis won the second title of her comeback at the Tier III Sunfeast Open in Kolkata, India. She defeated unseeded Russian Olga Puchkova in the final.

Hingis then lost a quarterfinal match to Kim Clijsters. This was the second consecutive year that Hingis had lost to Clijsters in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the third time in the last five Grand Slam tournaments that Clijsters had eliminated Hingis in the quarterfinals.\n\nHingis won her next tournament, the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, defeating Ana Ivanovic in the final. This was Hingis's record fifth singles title at this event.\n\nA hip injury that troubled her at the German Open caused her to withdraw from the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where she was the defending champion, and the French Open, the only important singles title that eluded her.\n\nIn her first round match at Wimbledon, Hingis saved two match points to defeat British wildcard Naomi Cavaday, apparently not having fully recovered from the hip injury that prevented her from playing the French Open. In the third round, Hingis lost to Laura Granville of the United States, and stated afterwards she should not have entered the tournament.\n\nHingis's next tournament was the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, in which Hingis lost in the third round to Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka. Hingis did not play any tournaments after the China Open, as she was beset by injuries for the rest of the year.\n\nITF suspension and second retirement \n\nIn November 2007, Hingis called a press conference to announce that she was under investigation for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, during a urine test taken by players at Wimbledon. Hingis' urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of benzoylecgonine. The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter states that \"the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml.\" As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.\n\n2008–09\n\nHaving retired for the second time in 2007, Hingis played an exhibition match at the Liverpool International tournament on 13 June 2008.

In February, she announced having committed to a full season with the World TeamTennis Tour in 2010. She had previously played for World Team Tennis in 2005 to assist her first comeback. Sparking thoughts that she was trying to come back to the WTA tour, she committed to playing at the Nottingham Masters. On 5 May 2010, it was announced that Hingis would reunite with her doubles partner Anna Kournikova. Kournikova was participating in competitive tennis for the first time in seven years, in the Invitational Ladies Doubles event at Wimbledon.

They beat Jana Novotná and Barbara Schett in the final. Hingis was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in July 2013, and in the same month, announced that she was coming out of retirement to play a doubles tournament, with Daniela Hantuchová as her partner, in Carlsbad, California.

That's what we try to do every match.\"[http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/14670758/martina-hingis-sania-mirza-win-australian-open-women-doubles-title \"Martina Hingis, Sania Mirza win 3rd major doubles title at Aussie Open\"]. espn.go.com. 29 January 2016.

However, they won the Italian Open, defeating Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina. At the French Open, they were upset by Czech pair Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková in the third round, which ended their 20 match winning streak in Grand Slam doubles tournaments.\n\nHingis won the French Open mixed doubles partnering Leander Paes. It is her first mixed doubles title at Roland Garros, and she completed the mixed doubles Career Grand Slam, becoming only the fourth woman ever to complete a career grand slam in both women's doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nHingis qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 20 years after her last Olympic appearance. She played doubles with Timea Bacsinszky and won the silver medal, losing to Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina in straight sets in the final. Hingis then played at the US Open with Coco Vandeweghe, where they made the semifinals and lost to top seeds Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic. At the WTA Finals, Hingis reunited with Sania Mirza in what would be the partnership's last tournament together; they defeated the Chan sisters in the quarterfinals but then lost to Makarova and Vesnina.\n\n2017: Three Major doubles titles, back to World No. 1 & third retirement\n\nHingis continued to partner CoCo Vandeweghe in women's doubles competition at the start of the 2017 season. Together they reached the quarter-finals of the Sydney International, losing to eventual champions Tímea Babos and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v5On2pakFKsk and the second round of the Australian Open, losing to the Australian duo of Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nSrI_XQSIrPA This capped a run of poor form, having gone 5–5 in tournaments since they made the semi-finals at the US Open the previous season. As a result, Hingis split with Vandeweghe and entered a new partnership with Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan, who herself had just split with her sister Chan Hao-ching. In the mixed doubles competition at the Australian Open, Hingis reached the quarter-finals with Leander Paes before losing to another Australian duo, Samantha Stosur and Sam Groth in straight sets.\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming Fed Cup quarter-final match between Switzerland and France, Hingis partnered compatriot Belinda Bencic to defend her St. Petersburg title. The pair lost in the first round 4–6, 6–4, [3–10] to Gabriela Dabrowski and Michaëlla Krajicek. In the Fed Cup quarter-final match, Hingis instead paired up with Timea Bacsinszky and won their doubles match 6–4, 6–4 against Amandine Hesse and Kristina Mladenovic, helping the team on to a 4–1 victory to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nIn the first two tournaments of their new partnership, Hingis and Chan suffered some \"tough\" losses. They fell to Olga Savchuk and Yaroslava Shvedova 6–3, 2–6, [6–10] in the semi-finals of the Qatar Open and to Andrea Hlaváčková and Peng Shuai in straight sets in the quarter-finals of the Dubai Tennis Championships.

They then reached the semi-finals of the Miami Open, before losing to Mirza and Strýcová 7–6(8–6), 1–6, [4–10].\n\nHingis again sought practice with a Swiss partner before the Fed Cup semi-final clash of Switzerland versus Belarus, and this time paired up with Bacsinszky to enter the inaugural Ladies Open Biel Bienne. Hingis and Bacsinszky reached the final before succumbing to Hsieh Su-wei and Monica Niculescu 7–5, 3–6, [7–10]. Despite winning her doubles rubber with Bacsinszky in the Fed Cup semi-final tie, Switzerland would ultimately lose 2–3. Switzerland had been seeking to reach its first final since Hingis had spearheaded the team to a narrow defeat to Spain in 1998.\n\nIn the clay court season, Hingis and Chan continued their good form to win back-to-back titles at the Madrid and Italian Opens, defeating Tímea Babos and Andrea Hlaváčková 6–4, 6–3 and Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina 7–5, 7–6(7–4) in the respective finals. Hingis' victory in Madrid was her 100th WTA career title. This success marked the pair as one of the pre-tournament favorites to win the French Open. Hingis and Chan reached the semi-finals, where their 12 match winning streak was ended by eventual champions Mattek-Sands and Šafářová, losing 4–6, 2–6. Hingis and Paes lost in the opening round of the mixed doubles competition to Katarina Srebotnik and Raven Klaasen in a super tiebreak.\n\nHingis and Chan again won back-to-back titles, this time at the Mallorca Open and the Eastbourne International. At Mallorca, they won the title by walkover after Jelena Janković and Anastasija Sevastova withdrew from the title match due to an injury sustained by Sevastova in the singles competition. At Eastbourne, they won after defeating Barty and Dellacqua 6–3, 7–5 in the final. However, like the French Open two months previous, Hingis and Chan could not replicate the success at Grand Slam level: losing at the quarter-final stage to Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Květa Peschke at Wimbledon. In the mixed doubles competition, Hingis paired up with new partner Great Britain's Jamie Murray after splitting from Paes. As top seeds they reached the final without losing a set, before defeating defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen 6–4, 6–4 in the championship match.\n\nHingis and Chan next played at the Canadian Open, where the German-Czech pair of Grönefeld and Peschke defeated them for the second tournament in a row in the quarter-finals. However, not to be deterred, a week later at the Cincinnati Open they produced another winning run and defeated Hsieh and Niculescu 4–6, 6–4, [10–7] in the final to capture their next title together. On the 14 August, Hingis and Chan became one of the first teams to qualify for the doubles competition at the year-end WTA Finals.\n\nAt the US Open, Hingis emerged victorious from both the women's and the mixed doubles competition. Murray and she defeated Chan Hao-ching and Michael Venus 6–1, 4–6, [10–8] in the final to capture their second consecutive title together and remain undefeated as a pair. Then, less than 24 hours later with Chan, they defeated Hradecká and Siniaková 6–3, 6–2 in the final to win their first major title together. In total, this was Hingis' 25th Grand Slam title across all disciplines.\n\nHingis and Chan extended their winning run to 18 matches in China by winning their third and fourth straight titles: the Wuhan and China Opens. In Wuhan, they defeated Shuko Aoyama and Yang Zhaoxuan 7–6(7–5), 3–6, [10–4] in the final. With this win Hingis ascended to the No.1 ranking on 2 October for the 67th week in her career. In Beijing, they defeated Babos and Hlaváčková 6–1, 6–4.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nSingles performance timeline\n\n* SR = the ratio of the number of singles tournaments won to the number played\n* 2If ITF women's circuit (Hardcourt: 12–2; Carpet: 6–1) and Fed Cup (10–0) participations are included, overall win-loss record stands at 548–133.\n\nGrand Slam singles finals: 12 (5–7)\n\nDoubles\n\nGrand Slam doubles finals: 16 finals (13–3)\n\nBy winning the 1998 US Open title, Hingis completed the doubles Career Grand Slam, becoming the 17th female player in history to achieve this, as well as the youngest.
