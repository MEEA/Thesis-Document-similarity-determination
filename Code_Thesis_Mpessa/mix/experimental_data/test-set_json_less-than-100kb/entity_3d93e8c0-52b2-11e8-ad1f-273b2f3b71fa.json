  "textBody" : "The Main  ( is a river in Germany.  With a length of 527 km, it is the longest right tributary of the Rhine. It is also the longest river lying entirely in Germany (if the Weser and the Werra are considered as two separate rivers; together they are longer). The largest cities along the Main are Frankfurt am Main and Würzburg.\n\nGeography\n\nThe mainspring of the Main River flows through the German states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg (forming the border with Bavaria for some distance) and Hesse.  Its basin competes with the Danube for water; as a result, many of its boundaries are identical with those of the European Watershed.\n\nThe Main begins near Kulmbach in Franconia at the joining of its two headstreams, the Red Main (Roter Main) and the White Main (Weißer Main).  The Red Main originates in the Franconian Jura mountain range, 50 km in length, and runs through Creussen and Bayreuth. The White Main originates in the mountains of the Fichtelgebirge; it is 41 km long. In its upper and middle section, the Main runs through the valleys of the German Highlands. Its lower section crosses the Lower Main Lowlands (Hanau-Seligenstadt Basin and northern Upper Rhine Plain) to Wiesbaden, where it discharges into the Rhine. Major tributaries of the Main are the Regnitz, the Franconian Saale, the Tauber, and the Nidda.\n\nThe name \"Main\" derives from the Latin Moenus or Menus. It is not related to the name of the city Mainz (Latin: Moguntiacum).\n\nNavigation\n\nThe Main is navigable for shipping from its mouth at the Rhine close to Mainz for  to Bamberg. Since 1992, the Main has been connected to the Danube via the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal and the highly regulated Altmühl river. The Main has been canalized with 34 large locks () to allow CEMT class V vessels () to navigate the total length of the river. The 16 locks in the adjacent Rhine-Main-Danube Canal and the Danube itself are of the same dimensions.\n\nDams and locks \n\nThere are 34 dams and locks along the 380 km navigable portion of the Main, from the confluence with the Regnitz near Bamberg, to the Rhine.\n\n* No.: Number of the lock (from upstream to downstream).\n* Name: Name of the lock.\n* Location: City or town where the lock is located.\n* Year built: Year when the lock was put into operation (replacement dates are also listed where applicable).\n* Main-km: Location on the Main, measured from the 0 km stone in Mainz-Kostheim.
