  "textBody" : "In mathematics, a set of elements (vectors) in a vector space V is called a basis, or a set of , if the vectors are linearly independent and every vector in the vector space is a linear combination of this set.  In more general terms, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set.\n\nGiven a basis of a vector space V, every element of V can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of basis vectors, whose coefficients are referred to as vector coordinates or components.  A vector space can have several distinct sets of basis vectors; however each such set has the same number of elements, with this number being the dimension of the vector space.\n\nDefinition \n\nA basis B of a vector space V over a field F is a linearly independent subset of V that spans V.\n\nIn more detail, suppose that B = { v1, …, vn } is a finite subset of a vector space V over a field F (such as the real or complex numbers R or C). Then B is a basis if it satisfies the following conditions:\n* the linear independence property,\n: for all a1, …, an ∈ F, if a1v1 + … + anvn 0, then necessarily a1 \n … an \n 0; and\n* the spanning property,\n: for every (vector) x in V it is possible to choose a1, …, an ∈ F such that x = a1v1 + … + anvn.\n\nThe numbers ai are called the coordinates of the vector x with respect to the basis B, and by the first property they are uniquely determined.\n\nA vector space that has a finite basis is called finite-dimensional.  To deal with infinite-dimensional spaces, we must generalize the above definition to include infinite basis sets.  We therefore say that a set (finite or infinite) B ⊂ V is a basis, if\n* every finite subset B0 ⊆ B obeys the independence property shown above; and\n* for every x in V it is possible to choose a1, …, an ∈ F and v1, …, vn ∈ B such that x = a1v1 + … + anvn.\n\nThe sums in the above definition are all finite because without additional structure the axioms of a vector space do not permit us to meaningfully speak about an infinite sum of vectors. Settings that permit infinite linear combinations allow alternative definitions of the basis concept: see Related notions below.\n\nIt is often convenient to list the basis vectors in a specific order, for example, when considering the transformation matrix of a linear map with respect to a basis. We then speak of an ordered basis, which we define to be a sequence (rather than a set) of linearly independent vectors that span V: see Ordered bases and coordinates below.\n\nProperties \n\nAgain, B denotes a subset of a vector space V. Then, B is a basis if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions are met:\n* B is a minimal generating set of V, i.e., it is a generating set and no proper subset of B is also a generating set.\n* B is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors, i.e., it is a linearly independent set but no other linearly independent set contains it as a proper subset.\n* Every vector in V can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in B in a unique way.  If the basis is ordered (see Ordered bases and coordinates below) then the coefficients in this linear combination provide coordinates of the vector relative to the basis.\n\nEvery vector space has a basis. The proof of this requires the axiom of choice.  All bases of a vector space have the same cardinality (number of elements), called the dimension of the vector space. This result is known as the dimension theorem, and requires the ultrafilter lemma, a strictly weaker form of the axiom of choice.\n\nAlso many vector sets can be attributed a standard basis which comprises both spanning and linearly independent vectors.\n\nStandard bases for example:\n\nIn Rn,  where ei is the ith column of the identity matrix.\n\nIn P2, where P2 is the set of all polynomials of degree at most 2,  is the standard basis.\n\nIn M22,  where M22 is the set of all 2×2 matrices. and Mm,n is the 2×2 matrix with a 1 in the m,n position and zeros everywhere else.\nChange of basis \n\nGiven a vector space V over a field F and suppose that  and  are two bases for V.  By definition, if ξ is a vector in V then  for a unique choice of scalars  in F called the coordinates of ξ relative to the ordered basis   The vector  in Fn is called the coordinate tuple of ξ (relative to this basis).  The unique linear map  with  for  is called the coordinate isomorphism for V and the basis   Thus  if and only if .\n\nA set of vectors can be represented by a matrix of which each column consists of the components of the corresponding vector of the set. As a basis is a set of vectors, a basis can be given by a matrix of this kind. The change of basis of any object of the space is related to this matrix. For example, coordinate tuples change with its inverse.\n\nExamples \n\n*Consider R2, the vector space of all coordinates  where both a and b are real numbers. Then a very natural and simple basis is simply the vectors  and : suppose that  is a vector in R2, then . But any two linearly independent vectors, like (1,1) and (−1,2), will also form a basis of R2.\n*More generally, the vectors e1, e2, ..., en are linearly independent and generate Rn. Therefore, they form a basis for Rn and the dimension of Rn is n. This basis is called the standard basis.\n*Let V be the real vector space generated by the functions et and e2t. These two functions are linearly independent, so they form a basis for V.\n*Let R[x] denote the vector space of real polynomials; then  is a basis of R[x]. The dimension of R[x] is therefore equal to aleph-0.\n\nExtending to a basis \n\nLet S be a subset of a vector space V.  To extend S to a basis means to find a basis B that contains S as a subset.  This can be done if and only if S is linearly independent.  Almost always, there is more than one such B, except in rather special circumstances (i.e. S is already a basis, or S is empty and V has two elements).\n\nA similar question is when does a subset S contain a basis.  This occurs if and only if S spans V.  In this case, S will usually contain several different bases.\n\nExample of alternative proofs \n\nOften, a mathematical result can be proven in more than one way.\nHere, using three different proofs, we show that the vectors (1,1) and (−1,2) form a basis for R2.\n\nFrom the definition of basis \n\nWe have to prove that these two vectors are linearly independent and that they generate R2.\n\nPart I: If two vectors v and w are linearly independent, then  av + bw 0  (a and b scalars) implies a \n 0, b = 0.\n\nTo prove that they are linearly independent, suppose that there are numbers a, b such that:\n a(1,1)+b(-1,2)=(0,0) \n(i.e., they are linearly dependent). Then:\n\n  (a-b,a+2b)(0,0)    and   \n  a-b0    and    \n  a+2b=0 .\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we obtain:\n\n  3b0    so    \n  b=0 .\nAdding this equation to the first equation then:\n a=0 .\n\nHence we have linear independence.\n\nPart II: To prove that these two vectors generate R2, we have to let  be an arbitrary element of R2, and show that there exist numbers  such that:\n r(1,1)+s(-1,2)=(a,b) .\nThen we have to solve the equations:\n r-s=a \n r+2s=b .\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n  3s=b-a ,           and then\n \n  s=(b-a)/3 ,         and finally\n rs+a\n((b-a)/3)+a=(b+2a)/3 .\n\nBy the dimension theorem \n\nSince (−1,2) is clearly not a multiple of (1,1) and since (1,1) is not the zero vector, these two vectors are linearly independent. Since the dimension of R2 is 2, the two vectors already form a basis of R2 without needing any extension.\n\nBy the invertible matrix theorem \n\nSimply compute the determinant\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix}1&-1\\\\1&2\\end{bmatrix}=3\\neq0.\nSince the above matrix has a nonzero determinant, its columns form a basis of R2. See: invertible matrix.\n\nOrdered bases and coordinates \n\nA basis is just a linearly independent set of vectors with or without a given ordering. For many purposes it is convenient to work with an ordered basis. For example, when working with a coordinate representation of a vector it is customary to speak of the \"first\" or \"second\" coordinate, which makes sense only if an ordering is specified for the basis. For finite-dimensional vector spaces one typically indexes a basis {vi} by the first n integers. An ordered basis is also called a frame.\n\nSuppose V is an n-dimensional vector space over a field F. A choice of an ordered basis for V is equivalent to a choice of a linear isomorphism φ from the coordinate space Fn to V.\n\nProof. The proof makes use of the fact that the standard basis of Fn is an ordered basis.\n\nSuppose first that\nφ : Fn → V\nis a linear isomorphism. Define an ordered basis {vi}  for V by\nvi = φ(ei) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n\nwhere {ei} is the standard basis for Fn.\n\nConversely, given an ordered basis, consider the map defined by\nφ(x) = x1v1 + x2v2 + ... + xnvn,\nwhere x = x1e1 + x2e2 + ... + xnen is an element of Fn. It is not hard to check that φ is a linear isomorphism.\n\nThese two constructions are clearly inverse to each other. Thus ordered bases for V are in 1-1 correspondence with linear isomorphisms Fn → V.\n\nThe inverse of the linear isomorphism φ determined by an ordered basis {vi} equips V with coordinates: if, for a vector v ∈ V, φ−1(v) (a1, a2,...,an) ∈ Fn, then the components aj \n aj(v) are the coordinates of v in the sense that v = a1(v) v1 + a2(v) v2 + ... + an(v) vn.\n\nThe maps sending a vector v to the components aj(v) are linear maps from V to F, because of φ−1 is linear. Hence they are linear functionals. They form a basis for the dual space of V, called the dual basis.\n\nRelated notions \n\nAnalysis \n\nIn the context of infinite-dimensional vector spaces over the real or complex numbers, the term  (named after Georg Hamel) or algebraic basis can be used to refer to a basis as defined in this article. This is to make a distinction with other notions of \"basis\" that exist when infinite-dimensional vector spaces are endowed with extra structure. The most important alternatives are orthogonal bases on Hilbert spaces, Schauder bases, and Markushevich bases on normed linear spaces. The term Hamel basis is also commonly used to mean a basis for the real numbers R  as a vector space over the field  Q of rational numbers. (In this case, the dimension of R over Q is uncountable, specifically the continuum, the cardinal number 2^{\\aleph _0}=\\mathfrak{c}.)  A consequence of the existence of a basis for R over Q is the existence of non-linear additive functions on R (see Cauchy's functional equation).\n\nThe common feature of the other notions is that they permit the taking of infinite linear combinations of the basis vectors in order to generate the space. This, of course, requires that infinite sums are meaningfully defined on these spaces, as is the case for topological vector spaces – a large class of vector spaces including e.g. Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, or Fréchet spaces.\n\nThe preference of other types of bases for infinite-dimensional spaces is justified by the fact that the Hamel basis becomes \"too big\" in Banach spaces: If X is an infinite-dimensional normed vector space which is complete (i.e. X is  a Banach space), then any Hamel basis of X is necessarily uncountable. This is a consequence of the Baire category theorem. The completeness as well as infinite dimension are crucial assumptions in the previous claim. Indeed, finite-dimensional spaces have by definition finite bases and there are infinite-dimensional (non-complete) normed spaces which have countable Hamel bases. Consider  c_{00}, the space of the sequences x(x_n) of real numbers which have only finitely many non-zero elements, with the norm \\|x\\|\n\\sup_n |x_n|. Its standard basis, consisting of the sequences having only one non-zero element, which is equal to 1, is a countable Hamel basis.\n\nExample \n\nIn the study of Fourier series, one learns that the functions {1} ∪ { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are an \"orthogonal basis\" of the (real or complex) vector space of all (real or complex valued) functions on the interval [0, 2π] that are square-integrable on this interval, i.e., functions f satisfying\n\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left|f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx\n\nThe functions {1} ∪ { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are linearly independent, and every function f that is square-integrable on [0, 2π] is an \"infinite linear combination\" of them, in the sense that\n\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\biggl|a_0+\\sum_{k1}^n \\bigl(a_k\\cos(kx)+b_k\\sin(kx)\\bigr)-f(x)\\biggr|^2\\,dx\n0\n\nfor suitable (real or complex) coefficients ak, bk.  But manyNote that one cannot say \"most\" because the cardinalities of the two sets (functions that can and cannot be represented with a finite number of basis functions) are the same. square-integrable functions cannot be represented as finite linear combinations of these basis functions, which therefore do not comprise a Hamel basis. Every Hamel basis of this space is much bigger than this merely countably infinite set of functions. Hamel bases of spaces of this kind are typically not useful, whereas orthonormal bases of these spaces are essential in Fourier analysis.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe geometric notions of an affine space, projective space, convex set, and cone have related notions of  basis. An affine basis for an n-dimensional affine space is n+1 points in general linear position. A   is n+2 points in general position, in a projective space of dimension n. A  of a polytope is the set of the vertices of its convex hull. A  consists of one point by edge of a polygonal cone. See also a Hilbert basis (linear programming).\n\nRandom basis\n\nFor a probability distribution in Rn with a probability density function, such as the equidistribution  in a n-dimensional ball with respect to Lebesgue measure, it can be shown that  randomly and independently chosen n-vectors will form a basis with probability one, which is due to the fact that n linearly dependent vectors x1,...,  xn in Rn should satisfy the equation\ndet[x1,...,  xn]0 (zero determinant of the matrix with columns xi), and the set of zeros of a non-trivial polynomial has zero measure. This observation has led to techniques for approximating random bases.\n\n \n\nIt is difficult to check numerically the linear dependence or exact orthogonality. Therefore, the notion of ε-orthogonality is used. For spaces  with inner product,  x is  ε-orthogonal to y if |\\langle x,y \\rangle|/(\\|x\\|\\|y\\|) (that is, cosine  of the angle between x and y is less than ε).\n\nIn high dimensions, two independent random vectors are with high probability almost orthogonal, and the number of independent random vectors, which all are with given high probability pairwise almost orthogonal, grows exponentially with dimension. More precisely, consider equidistribution in n-dimensional ball. Choose N independent random vectors from a ball (they are independent and identically distributed). Let θ be a small positive number. Then for\n\n[-\\ln(1-\\theta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}|Eq. 1}}\n\nN random vectors are all pairwise ε-orthogonal with probability 1-θ. This N growth exponentially with dimension n and N\\gg n for sufficiently big n. This property of random bases is a manifestation of the so-called measure concentration phenomenon.\n\nThe figure (right) illustrates distribution of lengths N of pairwise almost orthogonal chains of vectors that are independently randomly sampled from the n-dimensional cube [−1,1]n as a function of dimension, n. A point is first randomly selected in the cube. The second point is randomly chosen in the same cube. If the angle between the vectors was within π/2 ±0.037π/2 then the vector was retained. At the next step a new vector is generated in the same hypercube, and its angles with the previously generated vectors are evaluated. If these angles are within π/2 ±0.037π/2 then the vector is retained. The process is repeated until the chain of almost orthogonality breaks, and the number of such pairwise almost orthogonal vectors (length of the chain) is recorded. For each n, 20 pairwise almost orthogonal chains where constructed numerically for each dimension. Distribution of the length of these chains is presented.\n\nProof that every vector space has a basis\n\nLet V be any vector space over some field F.\nLet X be the set of all linearly independent subsets of V.\n\nThe set X is nonempty since the empty set is an independent subset of V,\nand it is partially ordered by inclusion, which is denoted, as usual, by .\n\nLet Y be a subset of X that is totally ordered by ,\nand let LY be the union of all the elements of Y (which are themselves certain subsets of V).\n\nSince (Y, ⊆) is totally ordered, every finite subset of LY is a subset of an element of Y,\nwhich is a linearly independent subset of V,\nand hence every finite subset of LY is linearly independent.\nThus LY is linearly independent, so LY is an element of X.\nTherefore LY is an upper bound for Y in (X, ⊆):\nit is an element of X, that contains every element Y.\n\nAs X is nonempty, and every totally ordered subset of (X, ⊆) has an upper bound in X, Zorn's lemma asserts that X has a maximal element. In other words, there exists some element Lmax of X satisfying the condition that whenever Lmax ⊆ L for some element L of X, then L = Lmax.\n\nIt remains to prove that Lmax is a basis of V.  Since Lmax belongs to X, we already know that Lmax is a linearly independent subset of V.\n\nIf Lmax would not span V, there would exist some vector w of V that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of elements of Lmax (with coefficients in the field F). In particular, w cannot be an element of Lmax.\nLet Lw  =  Lmax ∪ {w}. This set is an element of X, that is, it is a linearly independent subset of V (because w is not in the span of Lmax, and Lmax is independent). As Lmax ⊆ Lw, and Lmax ≠ Lw (because Lw contains the vector w that is not contained in Lmax), this contradicts the maximality of Lmax. Thus this shows that Lmax spans V.\n\nHence Lmax is linearly independent and spans V. It is thus a basis of V, and this proves that every vector space has a basis.\n\nThis proof relies on Zorn's lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Conversely, it may be proved that if every vector space has a basis, then the axiom of choice is true; thus the two assertions are equivalent.",

For many purposes it is convenient to work with an ordered basis. For example, when working with a coordinate representation of a vector it is customary to speak of the \"first\" or \"second\" coordinate, which makes sense only if an ordering is specified for the basis. For finite-dimensional vector spaces one typically indexes a basis {vi} by the first n integers. An ordered basis is also called a frame.\n\nSuppose V is an n-dimensional vector space over a field F. A choice of an ordered basis for V is equivalent to a choice of a linear isomorphism φ from the coordinate space Fn to V.\n\nProof. The proof makes use of the fact that the standard basis of Fn is an ordered basis.\n\nSuppose first that\nφ : Fn → V\nis a linear isomorphism. Define an ordered basis {vi}  for V by\nvi = φ(ei) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n\nwhere {ei} is the standard basis for Fn.\n\nConversely, given an ordered basis, consider the map defined by\nφ(x) = x1v1 + x2v2 + ... + xnvn,\nwhere x = x1e1 + x2e2 + ... + xnen is an element of Fn. It is not hard to check that φ is a linear isomorphism.\n\nThese two constructions are clearly inverse to each other. Thus ordered bases for V are in 1-1 correspondence with linear isomorphisms Fn → V.\n\nThe inverse of the linear isomorphism φ determined by an ordered basis {vi} equips V with coordinates: if, for a vector v ∈ V, φ−1(v) (a1, a2,...,an) ∈ Fn, then the components aj \n aj(v) are the coordinates of v in the sense that v = a1(v) v1 + a2(v) v2 + ... + an(v) vn.\n\nThe maps sending a vector v to the components aj(v) are linear maps from V to F, because of φ−1 is linear. Hence they are linear functionals. They form a basis for the dual space of V, called the dual basis.\n\nRelated notions \n\nAnalysis \n\nIn the context of infinite-dimensional vector spaces over the real or complex numbers, the term  (named after Georg Hamel) or algebraic basis can be used to refer to a basis as defined in this article.

Indeed, finite-dimensional spaces have by definition finite bases and there are infinite-dimensional (non-complete) normed spaces which have countable Hamel bases. Consider  c_{00}, the space of the sequences x(x_n) of real numbers which have only finitely many non-zero elements, with the norm \\|x\\|\n\\sup_n |x_n|. Its standard basis, consisting of the sequences having only one non-zero element, which is equal to 1, is a countable Hamel basis.\n\nExample \n\nIn the study of Fourier series, one learns that the functions {1} ∪ { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are an \"orthogonal basis\" of the (real or complex) vector space of all (real or complex valued) functions on the interval [0, 2π] that are square-integrable on this interval, i.e., functions f satisfying\n\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left|f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx\n\nThe functions {1} ∪ { sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } are linearly independent, and every function f that is square-integrable on [0, 2π] is an \"infinite linear combination\" of them, in the sense that\n\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\biggl|a_0+\\sum_{k1}^n \\bigl(a_k\\cos(kx)+b_k\\sin(kx)\\bigr)-f(x)\\biggr|^2\\,dx\n0\n\nfor suitable (real or complex) coefficients ak, bk.  But manyNote that one cannot say \"most\" because the cardinalities of the two sets (functions that can and cannot be represented with a finite number of basis functions) are the same. square-integrable functions cannot be represented as finite linear combinations of these basis functions, which therefore do not comprise a Hamel basis. Every Hamel basis of this space is much bigger than this merely countably infinite set of functions. Hamel bases of spaces of this kind are typically not useful, whereas orthonormal bases of these spaces are essential in Fourier analysis.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe geometric notions of an affine space, projective space, convex set, and cone have related notions of  basis. An affine basis for an n-dimensional affine space is n+1 points in general linear position. A   is n+2 points in general position, in a projective space of dimension n. A  of a polytope is the set of the vertices of its convex hull. A  consists of one point by edge of a polygonal cone. See also a Hilbert basis (linear programming).\n\nRandom basis\n\nFor a probability distribution in Rn with a probability density function, such as the equidistribution  in a n-dimensional ball with respect to Lebesgue measure, it can be shown that  randomly and independently chosen n-vectors will form a basis with probability one, which is due to the fact that n linearly dependent vectors x1,...,  xn in Rn should satisfy the equation\ndet[x1,...,  xn]0 (zero determinant of the matrix with columns xi), and the set of zeros of a non-trivial polynomial has zero measure. This observation has led to techniques for approximating random bases.\n\n \n\nIt is difficult to check numerically the linear dependence or exact orthogonality. Therefore, the notion of ε-orthogonality is used. For spaces  with inner product,  x is  ε-orthogonal to y if |\\langle x,y \\rangle|/(\\|x\\|\\|y\\|) (that is, cosine  of the angle between x and y is less than ε).\n\nIn high dimensions, two independent random vectors are with high probability almost orthogonal, and the number of independent random vectors, which all are with given high probability pairwise almost orthogonal, grows exponentially with dimension. More precisely, consider equidistribution in n-dimensional ball. Choose N independent random vectors from a ball (they are independent and identically distributed). Let θ be a small positive number. Then for\n\n[-\\ln(1-\\theta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}|Eq. 1}}\n\nN random vectors are all pairwise ε-orthogonal with probability 1-θ. This N growth exponentially with dimension n and N\\gg n for sufficiently big n. This property of random bases is a manifestation of the so-called measure concentration phenomenon.\n\nThe figure (right) illustrates distribution of lengths N of pairwise almost orthogonal chains of vectors that are independently randomly sampled from the n-dimensional cube [−1,1]n as a function of dimension, n. A point is first randomly selected in the cube. The second point is randomly chosen in the same cube. If the angle between the vectors was within π/2 ±0.037π/2 then the vector was retained. At the next step a new vector is generated in the same hypercube, and its angles with the previously generated vectors are evaluated. If these angles are within π/2 ±0.037π/2 then the vector is retained. The process is repeated until the chain of almost orthogonality breaks, and the number of such pairwise almost orthogonal vectors (length of the chain) is recorded. For each n, 20 pairwise almost orthogonal chains where constructed numerically for each dimension. Distribution of the length of these chains is presented.\n\nProof that every vector space has a basis\n\nLet V be any vector space over some field F.\nLet X be the set of all linearly independent subsets of V.\n\nThe set X is nonempty since the empty set is an independent subset of V,\nand it is partially ordered by inclusion, which is denoted, as usual, by .\n\nLet Y be a subset of X that is totally ordered by ,\nand let LY be the union of all the elements of Y (which are themselves certain subsets of V).\n\nSince (Y, ⊆) is totally ordered, every finite subset of LY is a subset of an element of Y,\nwhich is a linearly independent subset of V,\nand hence every finite subset of LY is linearly independent.\nThus LY is linearly independent, so LY is an element of X.\nTherefore LY is an upper bound for Y in (X, ⊆):\nit is an element of X, that contains every element Y.\n\nAs X is nonempty, and every totally ordered subset of (X, ⊆) has an upper bound in X, Zorn's lemma asserts that X has a maximal element. In other words, there exists some element Lmax of X satisfying the condition that whenever Lmax ⊆ L for some element L of X, then L = Lmax.\n\nIt remains to prove that Lmax is a basis of V.  Since Lmax belongs to X, we already know that Lmax is a linearly independent subset of V.\n\nIf Lmax would not span V, there would exist some vector w of V that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of elements of Lmax (with coefficients in the field F). In particular, w cannot be an element of Lmax.\nLet Lw  =  Lmax ∪ {w}. This set is an element of X, that is, it is a linearly independent subset of V (because w is not in the span of Lmax, and Lmax is independent). As Lmax ⊆ Lw, and Lmax ≠ Lw (because Lw contains the vector w that is not contained in Lmax), this contradicts the maximality of Lmax. Thus this shows that Lmax spans V.\n\nHence Lmax is linearly independent and spans V. It is thus a basis of V, and this proves that every vector space has a basis.\n\nThis proof relies on Zorn's lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Conversely, it may be proved that if every vector space has a basis, then the axiom of choice is true; thus the two assertions are equivalent.
