  "textBody" : "The Jurassic (; from Jura Mountains) was a geologic period and system that spanned 56 million years from the end of the Triassic Period  million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period  Mya. The Jurassic constituted the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \"Big Five\" mass extinctions.\n\nThe Jurassic is named after the Jura Mountains within the European Alps, where limestone strata from the period were first identified.\nBy the beginning of the Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses: Laurasia to the north, and Gondwana to the south. This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid, and many of the arid deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests. \n\nOn land, the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna, dominated by both dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs, to one dominated by dinosaurs alone. The first birds also appeared during the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs. Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards, and the evolution of therian mammals, including primitive placentals. Crocodilians made the transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic mode of life. The oceans were inhabited by marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, while pterosaurs were the dominant flying vertebrates.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe chronostratigraphic term \"Jurassic\" is directly linked to the Jura Mountains. During a tour of the region in 1795,Alexander von Humboldt, Kosmos, volume 4 (Stuttgart: Cotta, 1858), [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?iducm.5322149281;view\n1up;seq638 p. 632]: \"Ich hatte mich auf einer geognostischen Reise, die ich 1795 durch das südliche Franken, die westliche Schweiz und Ober-Italien machte, davon überzeugt, daß der Jura-Kalkstein, welchen Werner zu seinem Muschelkalk rechnete, eine eigne Formation bildete.

The Jurassic System, in stratigraphy, is divided into the Lower Jurassic, Middle, and Upper Jurassic series of rock formations, also known as Lias, Dogger and Malm in Europe.Kazlev, M. Alan (2002) [http://www.palaeos.com/Mesozoic/Jurassic/Jurassic.htm Palaeos website]  Accessed July. 22, 2008 The separation of the term Jurassic into three sections goes back to Leopold von Buch. The faunal stages from youngest to oldest are:\n\nPaleogeography and tectonics\n\nDuring the early Jurassic period, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.[http://www.scotese.com/late1.htm Late Jurassic] The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land over either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed.\n\nThe Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of that future landmass was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site in southern England and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen in Germany.[http://www.urweltmuseum.de/Englisch/museum_eng/Geologie_eng/Tektonik_eng.htm Jurassic Period]  In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.[http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html map]  Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation.\n\nThe Jurassic was a time of calcite sea geochemistry in which low-magnesium calcite was the primary inorganic marine precipitate of calcium carbonate. Carbonate hardgrounds were thus very common, along with calcitic ooids, calcitic cements, and invertebrate faunas with dominantly calcitic skeletons (Stanley and Hardie, 1998, 1999).\n\nThe first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern American cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny.Monroe and Wicander, 607. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Africa, Early Jurassic strata are distributed in a similar fashion to Late Triassic beds, with more common outcrops in the south and less common fossil beds which are predominated by tracks to the north. As the Jurassic proceeded, larger and more iconic groups of dinosaurs like sauropods and ornithopods proliferated in Africa. Middle Jurassic strata are neither well represented nor well studied in Africa. Late Jurassic strata are also poorly represented apart from the spectacular Tendaguru fauna in Tanzania. The Late Jurassic life of Tendaguru is very similar to that found in western North America's Morrison Formation.Jacobs, Louis, L. (1997). \"African Dinosaurs\". Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs.

The latter include ichthyosaurs, which were at the peak of their diversity, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, and marine crocodiles of the families Teleosauridae and Metriorhynchidae.Motani, R. (2000), Rulers of the Jurassic Seas, Scientific American vol.283, no. 6 Numerous turtles could be found in lakes and rivers.\n\nIn the invertebrate world, several new groups appeared, including rudists (a reef-forming variety of bivalves) and belemnites. Calcareous sabellids (Glomerula) appeared in the Early Jurassic. The Jurassic also had diverse encrusting and boring (sclerobiont) communities, and it saw a significant rise in the bioerosion of carbonate shells and hardgrounds. Especially common is the ichnogenus (trace fossil) Gastrochaenolites.\n\nDuring the Jurassic period, about four or five of the twelve clades of planktonic organisms that exist in the fossil record either experienced a massive evolutionary radiation or appeared for the first time.\n\nFile:Leedsi&Liopl DB.jpg|A Pliosaurus (right) harassing a Leedsichthys in a Jurassic sea.\nFile:Fischsaurier fg01.jpg|Ichthyosaurus from lower (early) Jurassic slates in southern Germany featured a dolphin-like body shape.\nFile:Muraenosaurus l2.jpg|Plesiosaurs like Muraenosaurus roamed Jurassic oceans.\nFile:JurassicMarineIsrael.JPG|Gastropod and attached mytilid bivalves on a Jurassic limestone bedding plane in southern Israel.\n\nTerrestrial\n\nOn land, various archosaurian reptiles remained dominant. The Jurassic was a golden age for the large herbivorous dinosaurs known as the sauropods—Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and many others—that roamed the land late in the period; their foraging grounds were either the prairies of ferns, palm-like cycads and bennettitales, or the higher coniferous growth, according to their adaptations. The smaller Ornithischian herbivore dinosaurs, like stegosaurs and small ornithopods were less predominant, but played important roles. They were preyed upon by large theropods, such as Ceratosaurus, Megalosaurus, Torvosaurus and Allosaurus. All these belong to the 'lizard hipped' or saurischian branch of the dinosaurs.\nDuring the Late Jurassic, the first avialans, like Archaeopteryx, evolved from small coelurosaurian dinosaurs. In the air, pterosaurs were common; they ruled the skies, filling many ecological roles now taken by birds, and may have already produced some of the largest flying animals of all time.[http://markwitton-com.blogspot.pt/2016/06/why-giant-azhdarchid-arambourgiania.html Why the giant azhdarchid Arambourgiania philadelphiae needs a fanclub] Within the undergrowth were various types of early mammals, as well as tritylodonts, lizard-like sphenodonts, and early lissamphibians.

Gymnosperms were relatively diverse during the Jurassic period. The Conifers in particular dominated the flora, as during the Triassic; they were the most diverse group and constituted the majority of large trees.\n\nExtant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the Araucariaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae and Taxodiaceae.Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 349. The extinct Mesozoic conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby Bennettitales.Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 352 Cycads, similar to palm trees, were also common, as were ginkgos and Dicksoniaceous tree ferns in the forest. Smaller ferns were probably the dominant undergrowth. Caytoniaceous seed ferns were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 353 Ginkgo plants were particularly common in the mid- to high northern latitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, podocarps were especially successful, while Ginkgos and Czekanowskiales were rare.\n\nIn the oceans, modern coralline algae appeared for the first time.
