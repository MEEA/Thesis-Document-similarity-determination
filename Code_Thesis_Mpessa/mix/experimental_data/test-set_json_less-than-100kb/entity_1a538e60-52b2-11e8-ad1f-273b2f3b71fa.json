  "textBody" : "ICQ is an instant messaging client that was first developed and popularized by the Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase \"I Seek You\". Ownership of ICQ passed from Mirabilis to AOL in 1998, and from AOL to Mail.Ru Group in 2010.\n\nThe ICQ client application and service were initially released in November 1996 and the client was freely available to download. Users could register an account and would be assigned a number, like a phone number, for others to be able to contact them (users could also provide handles). ICQ was the first stand-alone instant messenger and the first online instant messenger service  — while real-time chat was not in itself new to the internet (IRC being the most common platform at the time), the concept of a fully centralized service with individual user accounts focused on one-on-one conversations set the blueprint for later instant messaging services like AIM, and its influence is seen in modern social media applications.\n\nAt its peak around 2001, ICQ had more than 100 million accounts registered.[http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2001/05/09/icq-celebrates-100-million-registered-users ICQ Surpasses 100 Million Registered Users], Time Warner Press Release - May 09, 2001 (accessed 2015-05-12). At the time of the Mail.Ru acquisition in 2010, there were around 42 million daily users. Since 2013, ICQ has 11 million monthly users.\n\nFeatures\n\n*ICQ features include offline user messaging, multi-user chats, free daily-limited SMS sending, resumable file transfers, greeting cards, multiplayer games and a searchable user directory. Users can use emoticons while chatting with other users.\n*ICQ6 was launched on April 17, 2007, and offered a single communication platform that combines the various user options: instant messaging services, free SMS from ICQ to mobile, voice and video communication. The software's sounds were created by the Israeli psychedelic trance duo Infected Mushroom. Among the new additional features in ICQ6 are Quick IM, which allows users to send a short message without opening a conversation window, a \"follow me\" service directly to the user’s mobile, a multi-chat service and support for Zlango, the animated icons language.\n\nAdditional products\n\nICQ provides all users additional services and content products:\n#ICQ TV—An online video magazine. The magazine broadcasts content for teens 24/7.\n#ICQ SIM Card (together with United Mobile)—A SIM card that enables users traveling across Europe to use their cellular telephones while paying a discount price.\n#ICQ Game Center—A games platform that enables the user to play with and/or against other users. Available by clicking a button in the contact list.\n#ICQ2Go—A web instant messaging option for users who cannot download the program onto their computers or use it on the networks they are accessing (for various reasons, like security restrictions or firewalls).\n#ICQ for Mac[http://www.icq.com/download/mac/en ICQ for Mac]  (Beta)—Released in February 2010, a version of the client that was developed using the Adobe AIR platform, making it usable on additional operating systems which support the AIR runtime, such as Linux.\nAlso, users can choose and select their own avatars for their profile pages. In this way, they can protect their privacy.\n\nUIN\n\nICQ users are identified and distinguished from one another by UIN, or User Identification Numbers, distributed in sequential order. The UIN was invented by Mirabilis, as the user name assigned to each user upon registration. Issued UINs started at '10,000' (5 digits) and every user receives a UIN when first registering with ICQ. As of ICQ6 users are also able to log in using the specific e-mail address they associated with their UIN during the initial registration process.\nUnlike other instant messaging software or web applications, on ICQ the only permanent user info is the UIN, although it is possible to search for other users using their associated e-mail address or any other detail they have made public by updating it in their account's public profile. In addition the user can change all of his or her personal information, including screen name and e-mail address, without having to re-register. Since 2000 ICQ and AIM users are able to add each other to their contact list without the need for any external clients. As a response to UIN theft or sale of attractive UINs, ICQ started to store email addresses previously associated with a UIN.[http://www.icq.com/register/email_attach.php icq.com]  As such UINs that are stolen can sometimes be reclaimed. This applies only if (since 1999 onwards) a valid primary email address was entered into the user profile.\n\nHistory\n\nThe founding company of ICQ, Mirabilis, was established in June 1996 by five Israelis:  Yair Goldfinger, Sefi Vigiser, Amnon Amir, Arik Vardi, and Arik's father Yossi Vardi.[http://www.israel21c.org/an-artist-for-the-high-tech-age/ An artist for the high-tech age] They recognized that many people were accessing the internet through non-UNIX operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, and those users were unfamiliar with established chat technologies, e.g. IRC.\n\nThe technology Mirabilis developed for ICQ was distributed free of charge. The technology's success encouraged AOL to acquire Mirabilis on June 8, 1998, for $287 million up front and $120 million in additional payments over three years based on performance levels. At the time this was the highest price ever paid to purchase an Israeli technology company. In 2002 AOL successfully patented the technology.\n\nAfter the purchase the product was initially managed by Ariel Yarnitsky and Avi Shechter. ICQ's management changed at the end of 2003. Under the leadership of the new CEO, Orey Gilliam, who also assumed the responsibility for all of AOL's messaging business in 2007, ICQ resumed its growth; it was not only a highly profitable company, but one of AOL's most successful businesses. Eliav Moshe replaced Gilliam in 2009 and became ICQ's managing director.\n\nIn April 2010, AOL sold ICQ to Digital Sky Technologies, headed by Alisher Usmanov, for $187.5 million. While ICQ was displaced by AOL Instant Messenger, Google Talk, and other competitors in the U.S. and many other countries over the 2000s, it remained the most popular instant messaging network in Russian-speaking countries, and an important part of online culture. Popular UINs demanded over 11,000 rubles in 2010.\n\nIn September of that year, Digital Sky Technologies changed its name to Mail.Ru Group. Since the acquisition, Mail.ru has invested in turning ICQ from a desktop client to a mobile messaging system. As of 2013, around half of ICQ’s users were using its mobile apps, and in 2014, the number of users began growing for the first time since the purchase.\n\nIn March 2016 the source code of the client was released under the Apache license released on github.com.[http://omgdgt.com/2016/03/messeneger-icq-has-opened-the-source-code/ Messeneger ICQ has opened the source code] [https://github.com/mailru/icqdesktop icqdesktop] on github.com\n\nDevelopment history\n\n*ICQ 99a/b the first releases that were widely available.\n*ICQ 2000 incorporated into Notes and Reminder features.\n*ICQ 2001 included server-side storage of the contact list, allowing for its synchronization on multiple computers.\n*On December 19, 2002, AOL Time Warner announced that ICQ had been issued a United States patent for instant messaging.\n*ICQ 2002 was the last completely advertising-free ICQ version.\n*ICQ Pro 2003b was the first ICQ version to use the ICQ protocol version 10. However, ICQ 5 and 5.1 use version 9 of the protocol. ICQ 2002 and 2003a used version 8 of the ICQ protocol. Earlier versions (ICQ 2001b and all ICQ clients before it) used ICQ protocol version 7.\n*ICQ 4 and later ICQ 5 (released on Monday, February 7, 2005), were upgrades on ICQ Lite. One addition was Xtraz, which offers games and features intended to appeal to younger users of the Internet. ICQ Lite was originally an idea to offer the lighter users of instant messaging an alternative client which was a smaller download and less resource-hungry for relatively slow computers.\n*ICQ 5 introduced skins support. There are few official skins available for the current ICQ 5.1 at the official website; however, a number of user-generated skins have been made available for download.\n*ICQ 6, released on April 17, 2007, was the first major update since ICQ 4. The user interface has been redesigned using Boxely, the same rendering engine used in AIM Triton. This change adds new features such as the ability to send IMs directly from the client's contact list. ICQ has recently started forcing users of v5.1 to upgrade to version 6 (and XP).  Those who do not upgrade will find their older version of ICQ does not start up.  Although the upgrade to version 6 should be seen as a positive thing, some users may find that useful features such as sending multiple files at one time is no longer supported in the new version.  At the beginning of July 2008, a network upgrade forced users to stop using ICQ 5.1 - applications that identified themselves as ICQ 5, such as Pidgin, were forced to identify themselves as ICQ 6. There seems to be no alternative for users other than using a different IM program or patching ICQ 5.1 with a special application.\n*ICQ 7.0, released on January 18, 2010. This update includes integration with Facebook and other websites. It also allows custom personal status similar to Windows Live Messenger (MSN Messenger). ICQ 7.0 does not support traditional Chinese on standard installation or with the addition of an official language pack. This has made its adoption difficult with the established user base from Hong Kong and Taiwan where traditional Chinese is the official language.\n*ICQ 8, released on February 5, 2012 - \"Meet the new generation of ICQ, Enjoy free video calls, messages and SMS, social networks support and more.\"\n*ICQ 10.0 10242, released January 18, 2016 - Newest update.\n\nCriticism\n\nPrivacy and copyright\n\nWhen accepting \"ICQ Privacy Policy\" (2011), a user gives all the copyright in the posted information to ICQ Inc.[https://privacy.icq.com/legal/privacypolicy/en \"ICQ Privacy Policy — Acceptable Use Policy\"] This implies that ICQ Inc. may publish, distribute etc. any messages sent through the system, including those the user intended to be private:\n\nPlease be aware that any information you may have published in a public area (Public Area) may be accessible to ICQ or third parties and used by ICQ or such third parties. Therefore carefully consider whether you wish such information to be accessible. Public areas may include your user profile (depending on the level of your privacy settings) any blogs, message boards, forums or similar services made available through the ICQ Services.\n\nPressure on alternative clients\n\nAOL pursued an aggressive policy regarding alternative (\"unauthorized\") ICQ clients.\n*In July 2008 changes were implemented on ICQ servers causing many unofficial clients to stop working. These users received an official notification from \"ICQ System\".\n*On December 9, 2008, another change to the ICQ servers was made. The clients that were sending Client IDs not matching ICQ 5.1 or higher stopped working.\n*On December 29, 2008, ICQ press service distributed a statement characterizing alternative clients as dangerous.[http://www.cyberstyle.ru/newslineyandex/view/4538 Официальное заявление ICQ: использовать QIP — опасно (in Russian)]\n*On January 21, 2009, ICQ servers started blocking all unofficial clients in Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States countries.[http://profy.com/2009/01/21/aol-engaged-in-dubious-competition-practices-for-icq-in-russia/ AOL Engaged in Dubious Competition Practices for ICQ in Russia] Users in Russia and Ukraine received a message from UIN 1:\n\n\"Системное сообщение\nICQ не поддерживает используемую вами версию.
