  "textBody" : "In geometry, a Johnson solid is a strictly convex polyhedron, which is not uniform (i.e., not a Platonic solid, Archimedean solid, prism or antiprism), and each face of which is a regular polygon. There is no requirement that each face must be the same polygon, or that the same polygons join around each vertex. An example of a Johnson solid is the square-based pyramid with equilateral sides (J1); it has 1 square face and 4 triangular faces.\n\nAs in any strictly convex solid, at least three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The pentagonal pyramid (J2) is an example that actually has a degree-5 vertex.\n\nAlthough there is no obvious restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, it turns out that the faces of Johnson solids always have 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 sides.\n\nIn 1966, Norman Johnson published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. Victor Zalgaller in 1969 proved that Johnson's list was complete.\n\nOf the Johnson solids, the elongated square gyrobicupola (J37), also called the pseudorhombicuboctahedron,http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pseudo-rhombicuboctahedra.html is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are 4 faces at each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: 3 squares and 1 triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an Archimedean solid.\n\nNames \n\nThe naming of Johnson solids follows a flexible and precise descriptive formula, such that many solids can be named in different ways without compromising their accuracy as a description. Most Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few (pyramids, cupolae, and rotunda), together with the Platonic and Archimedean solids, prisms, and antiprisms; the centre of a particular solid's name will reflect these ingredients. From there, a series of prefixes are attached to the word to indicate additions, rotations and transformations:\n\n*Bi- indicates that two copies of the solid in question are joined base-to-base. For cupolae and rotundae, the solids can be joined so that either like faces (ortho-) or unlike faces (gyro-) meet. Using this nomenclature, an octahedron can be described as a  square bipyramid, a cuboctahedron as a triangular gyrobicupola, and an icosidodecahedron as a pentagonal gyrobirotunda.\n*Elongated indicates a prism is joined to the base of the solid in question, or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. A rhombicuboctahedron can thus be described as an elongated square orthobicupola.\n*Gyroelongated indicates an antiprism is joined to the base of the solid in question or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. An icosahedron can thus be described as a gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid.\n*Augmented indicates another polyhedron, namely a pyramid or cupola, is joined to one or more faces of the solid in question.\n*Diminished indicates a pyramid or cupola is removed from one or more faces of the solid in question.\n*Gyrate indicates a cupola mounted on or featured in the solid in question is rotated such that different edges match up, as in the difference between ortho- and gyrobicupolae.\n\nThe last three operations – augmentation, diminution, and gyration – can be performed multiple times certain large solids.  Bi- & Tri- indicate a double and treble operation respectively. For example, a bigyrate solid has two rotated cupolae, and a tridiminished solid has three removed pyramids or cupolae.\n\nIn certain large solids, a distinction is made between solids where altered faces are parallel and solids where altered faces are oblique. Para- indicates the former, that the solid in question has altered parallel faces, and Meta- the latter, altered oblique faces. For example, a parabiaugmented solid has had two parallel faces augmented, and a metabigyrate solid has had 2 oblique faces gyrated.\n\nThe last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes from which they are assembled. These names are defined by Johnson\nwith the following nomenclature:\n\n*A lune is a complex of two triangles attached to opposite sides of a square.\n*Spheno- indicates a wedgelike complex formed by two adjacent lunes. Dispheno- indicates two such complexes.\n*Hebespheno- indicates a blunt complex of two lunes separated by a third lune.\n*Corona is a crownlike complex of eight triangles.\n*Megacorona is a larger crownlike complex of 12 triangles.\n*The suffix -cingulum indicates a belt of 12 triangles.\n\nEnumeration \n\nPyramids \n\nThe first two Johnson solids, J1 and J2, are pyramids. The triangular pyramid is the regular tetrahedron, so it is not a Johnson solid.\n\nCupolae and rotunda\n\nThe next four Johnson solids are three cupolae and one rotunda. They represent sections of uniform polyhedra.\n\nElongated and gyroelongated pyramids\n\nThe next five Johnson solids are elongated and gyroelongated pyramids. These represent the composite or augmentation of two polyhedra.  In the gyroelongated triangular pyramid, three pairs of adjacent triangles are coplanar and form non-square rhombi, so it is not a Johnson solid.\n\nBipyramids \n\nThe next six Johnson solids are bipyramids, elongated bipyramids, and gyroelongated bipyramids:\n\nElongated cupolae and rotundae \n\nBicupolae \n\nThe triangular gyrobicupola is a semiregular polyhedron (in this case an Archimedean solid), so it is not a Johnson solid.\n\nBianticupolae \n\nAll of the orthobianticupola have coplanar faces. The gyrobianticupola are another construction for the snub antiprisms.\n\nCupola-rotundae and birotunda \n\nElongated bicupolae \n\nElongated cupola-rotundae and birotundae \n\nGyroelongated bicupolae, cupola-rotunda, and birotunda \n\nThese Johnson solids have 2 chiral forms.\n\nAugmented triangular prisms \n\nAugmented pentagonal and hexagonal prisms\n\nAugmented dodecahedra \n\nDiminished icosahedra \n\nAugmented truncated tetrahedron and truncated cubes \n\nAugmented truncated dodecahedra \n\nGyrate rhombicosidodecahedra \n\nDiminished rhombicosidodecahedra \n\nSnub antiprisms \n\nThe snub antiprisms can be constructed as an alternation of a truncated antiprism. Two are Johnson solids, one is a regular, and the rest can not be constructed with regular triangles.\n\nOthers \n\nClassification by types of faces \n\nTriangle-faced Johnson solids \n\nFive Johnson solids are deltahedra, with all equilateral triangle faces:\n\nTriangle and square-faced Johnson solids \n\nTwenty four Johnson solids have only triangle or square faces:\n\nTriangle and pentagonal-faced Johnson solids \n\nEleven Johnson solids have only triangle and pentagonal faces:\n\nTriangle, square and hexagonal-faced Johnson solids \n\nEight Johnson solids have only triangle, square and hexagonal faces:\n\nTriangle, square and octagonal-faced Johnson solids \n\nFive Johnson solids have only triangle, square and octagonal faces:\n\nCircumscribable Johnson solids \n\n25 of the Johnson solids have vertices that exist on the surface of a sphere: 1–6,11,19,27,34,37,62,63,72–83.
