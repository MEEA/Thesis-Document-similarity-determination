The Hedjaz Jordan Railway runs one passenger train a day each way.\n\nRoadways \n\nIn 2009, it was estimated that Jordan had 7891 km of paved highways. Some of the major highways in Jordan are:\n* Highway 15 (Desert Highway): connects the Syrian border with Amman and to the port city of Aqaba on the Gulf of Aqaba. It is a four-lane, double carriageway road almost on its entirety, from the Syrian border until the junction with the road to Petra.\n* Highway 35 (King's Highway): connects Irbid in the northern region to Aqaba, it takes the name and route of the historic King's Highway. It has four lanes on double carriageway on its stretch from Irbid until Amman.\n* Highway 65 (Dead Sea Highway): connects Aqaba to the northwestern region of Jordan.\n** The first part of the highway (Safi-Aqaba) was constructed in 1978 as part of the Red Sea - Dead Sea Access.
