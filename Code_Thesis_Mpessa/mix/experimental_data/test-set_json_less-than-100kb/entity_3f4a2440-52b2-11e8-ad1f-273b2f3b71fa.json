  "textBody" : "Murad IV (, Murād-ı Rābiʿ; 26/27 July 1612 – 8 February 1640) was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1623 to 1640, known both for restoring the authority of the state and for the brutality of his methods. Murad IV was born in Istanbul, the son of Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603–17) and the ethnic Greek Kösem Sultan. Brought to power by a palace conspiracy in 1623, he succeeded his uncle Mustafa I (r. 1617–18, 1622–23). He was only 11 when he took the throne. His reign is most notable for the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39), of which the outcome would permanently part the Caucasus between the two Imperial powers for around two centuries, while it also roughly laid the foundation for the current Turkey–Iran–Iraq borders.\n\nBiography \n\nEarly reign (1623–32)\n\nMurad IV was for a long time under the control of his relatives and during his early years as Sultan, his mother, Kösem Sultan, essentially ruled through him. The Empire fell into anarchy; the Safavid Empire invaded Iraq almost immediately, Northern Anatolia erupted in revolts, and in 1631 the Janissaries stormed the palace and killed the Grand Vizier, among others. Murad IV feared suffering the fate of his elder brother, Osman II (1618–22), and decided to assert his power.\n\nAt the age of 16 in 1628, he had his brother-in-law (his sister Fatma Sultan's husband) and the former governor of Egypt Kara Mustafa Pasha executed for a claimed action \"against the law of God\".\n\nAbsolute rule and imperial policies (1632–40)\n\nMurad IV tried to quell the corruption that had grown during the reigns of previous Sultans, and that had not been checked while his mother was ruling through proxy.\n\nMurad IV also banned alcohol, tobacco, and coffee in Istanbul. He ordered execution for breaking this ban. He would reportedly patrol the streets and the lowest taverns of Istanbul in civilian clothes at night, policing the enforcement of his command by casting off his disguise on the spot and beheading the offender with his own hands. Rivaling the exploits of Selim the Grim, he would sit in a kiosk by the water near his Seraglio Palace and shoot arrows at any boat man who rowed too close to his imperial compound. He restored the judicial regulations by very strict punishments, including execution, he once strangled a grand vizier for the reason that the official had beaten his mother-in-law. Historians including Halil İnalcık as well as primary sources report that even though he was a ruthless supporter of alcohol prohibition, Murad IV was a habitual drinker himself.\n\nWar against Safavid Iran\n\nMurad IV's reign is most notable for the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39) against Persia (today Iran) in which Ottoman forces managed to conquer Azerbaijan, occupying Tabriz, Hamadan, and capturing Baghdad in 1638. The Treaty of Zuhab that followed the war generally reconfirmed the borders as agreed by the Peace of Amasya, with Eastern Armenia, Eastern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Dagestan staying Persian, while Western Armenia, and Western Georgia stayed Ottoman. Mesopotamia was irrevocably lost for the Persians.Roemer (1989), p. 285 The borders fixed as a result of the war, are more or less the same as the present border line between Turkey, Iraq and Iran.\n\nDuring the siege of Baghdad in 1638, the city held out for forty days but was compelled to surrender, and the bulk of the population were butchered by the conquerors, in spite of the promises that they had made to spare them. It is said that the officers of Murad arranged a sort of tableau, in which the heads were struck off one thousand captives by one thousand headsmen at the same moment, and that Murad IV enjoyed the sight.\n\nMurad IV himself commanded the Ottoman army in the last years of the war. He was the first Ottoman Sultan to command an army on the battlefield since the death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566.\n\nRelations with the Mughal Empire\n\nWhile he was encamped in Baghdad, Murad IV is known to have met ambassadors of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Mir Zarif and Mir Baraka, who presented 1000 pieces of finely embroidered cloth and even armor. Murad IV gave them the finest weapons, saddles and Kaftans and ordered his forces to accompany the Mughals to the port of Basra, where they set sail to Thatta and finally Surat.\n\nArchitecture\n\nMurad IV put emphasis on architecture and in his period many monuments were erected.  The Baghdad Kiosk, built in 1635, and the Revan Kiosk, built in 1638 in Yerevan, were both built in the local styles. Some of the others include the Kavak Sarayı pavilion; the Meydanı Mosque; the Bayram Pasha Dervish Lodge, Tomb, Fountain, and Primary School; and the Şerafettin Mosque in Konya.\n\nFamily\n\n;Consorts\nVery little is known about the concubines of Murad IV, principally because he did not leave sons who survived his death to reach the throne but, privy purse registers record the presence of a single haseki, Ayşe Sultan until the very end of Murad's seventeen-year reign. It is possible that Murad had only a single concubine until the advent of the second, or that he had a number of concubines but singled out only one as haseki. A vakf (meaning charitable foundation) inscription dating from 1628 reveals the existence of a concubine of Murad named Sanavber Hatun, who likely was of haseki rank. If Ayșe was initially his only concubine, it is probably his lack of male issue that prompted him to take another, for his sons all died in infancy. \n;Sons \n*Şehzade Ahmed (21 December 1628 – 1639); \n*Şehzade Numan (1628 – 1629);\n*Şehzade Orhan (1629 – 1629);\n*Şehzade Hasan (March 1631 – 1632);\n*Şehzade Suleiman (2 February 1632 – 1635); \n*Şehzade Mehmed (8 August 1633 – 1640);\n*Şehzade Osman (9 February 1634 – February 1634); \n*Şehzade Alaeddin (26 August 1635 – 1637);\n*Şehzade Selim (1637 – 1640); \n*Şehzade Abdul Hamid (15 May 1638 – 1638);\n;Daughters\nMurad had three daughters:\n*Kaya Sultan alias Ismihan (1633 – 1659, buried in Mustafa I Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia Mosque, Istanbul), married August 1644, Damat Abaza Melek Ahmed Pasha, Vizier 1638 and 1650–1651;\n*Safiye Sultan (buried in Ahmed I Mausoleum, Blue Mosque, Istanbul), married 1659, Damat Abaza Husein Pasha, Vizier 1674–1675, son of Abaza Siyavuş Pasha;\n*Rukiye Sultan (died 1696, buried in Ahmed I Mausoleum, Blue Mosque, Istanbul), married firstly 1663, Şeytan Divrikli Ibrahim Pasha, Vizier, married secondly 1693 Damat Gürcü Mehmed Pasha.\n\nDeath\n\nMurad IV died from cirrhosis in Istanbul at the age of 27 in 1640.Selcuk Aksin Somel, Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire, 2003, p.201\n\nRumours had circulated that on his deathbed, Murad IV ordered the execution of his mentally disabled brother, Ibrahim (reigned 1640–48), which would have meant the end of the Ottoman line.
