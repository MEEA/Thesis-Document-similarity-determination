  "textBody" : "A concept album is an album in which its tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually. This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical. Sometimes the term is referenced to albums considered to be of \"uniform excellence\" rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif. The exact criterion for a \"concept album\" varies among critics, with no discernible consensus. \n\nThe format originates with folk singer Woody Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads (1940) and subsequently popularized by traditional pop singer Frank Sinatra's 1940s–50s string of albums, but the term is more often associated with rock music. In the 1960s, several well-regarded concept albums were released by various rock bands, which eventually led to the invention of progressive rock and the rock opera. Since then, many concept albums have been released across many different musical genres.\n\nDefinitions\n\nConcepts are general ideas, thoughts, or abstract notions. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a \"concept album\". Fiona Sturges of The Independent stated that the concept album \"was originally defined as a long-player where the songs were based on one dramatic idea – but the term is subjective.\"  A precursor to this type of album can be found in the 19th century song cycle which ran into some of the same difficulties in classification. The extremely broad definitions of a \"concept album\" could potentially encompass all soundtracks, compilations, cast recordings, greatest hits albums, tribute albums, Christmas albums, and live albums.\n\nThe most common definitions refer to an expanded approach to the rock album format (as a story, play, or opus), or a project that either revolves around a specific theme or a collection of related materials. AllMusic writes, \"A concept album could be a collection of songs by an individual songwriter or a particular theme -- these are the concept LPs that reigned in the '50s ... the phrase 'concept album' is inextricably tied to the late 1960s, when rock & rollers began stretching the limits of their art form.\" Author Jim Cullen describes it: \"a collection of discrete but thematically unified songs whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts ... sometimes [erroneously] assumed to be a product of the rock era.\" Author Roy Shuker defines concept albums and rock operas as albums that are \"unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical. ...  In this form, the album changed from a collection of heterogeneous songs into a narrative work with a single theme, in which individual songs segue into one another.\"\n\nHistory\n\n1940s–60s: Origins\n\nYes keyboardist Rick Wakeman considers the first concept album to be Woody Guthrie's 1940 album Dust Bowl Ballads. The Independent regards it as \"perhaps\" one of the first concept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the LP record was introduced, with space age pop composers making concept albums soon after. Some of the themes were about exploring wild life; some were made to be played while dining or relaxing; others were more abstract and centered on emotions. This was accompanied in the mid 1950s with the invention of the gatefold, which allowed room for liner notes to explain the concept.\n\nSinger Frank Sinatra recorded several concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955) and Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely (1958). Sinatra is sometimes credited as the inventor of the concept album, beginning with The Voice of Frank Sinatra (1946), which led to similar work by Bing Crosby. According to biographer Will Friedwald: \"Sinatra sequenced the songs so that the lyrics created a flow from track to track, affording an impression of a narrative, as in musical comedy or opera. ... [He was the] first pop singer to bring a consciously artistic attitude to recording.\"\n\nIn the context of 1960s popular music, albums became closely aligned with countercultural ideology, resulting in a recognised \"album era\" and the introduction of the rock concept album. The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966), the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and the Who's Tommy (1969) are variously cited as \"the first concept album\", usually for their \"uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif\". Commentators and historians frequently cite Pet Sounds as the first concept album of rock music, although \"popular consensus\", according to AllMusic, favours Sgt. Pepper. According to music critic Tim Riley, \"Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention's Freak Out! [June 1966] has claims as the first 'concept album', but Sgt. Pepper was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears.\" Musicologist Allan Moore says that \"Even though previous albums had set a unified mood, it was on the basis of the influence of Sgt. Pepper that the penchant for the concept album was born.\" Adding to Sgt. Peppers claim, the artwork reinforced its central theme by depicting the four Beatles in uniform as members of the Sgt. Pepper band, while the record omitted the gaps that usually separated album tracks.

In the early 1960s, concept albums began featuring highly in American country music, but the fact has been largely ignored by rock/pop fans and critics who would only begin acknowledging \"concept albums\" as a phenomenon nearly ten years later. The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time (2015) states that the Ventures \"pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born\". Another is the Beach Boys' Little Deuce Coupe (1963). Writing in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, Chris Smith noted: \"Though albums such as Frank Sinatra's 1955 In the Wee Small Hours and Marty Robbins' 1959 Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs had already introduced concept albums, Little Deuce Coupe was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers.\" Writing in his Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture, Marcel Danesi identifies the Beatles' Rubber Soul (December 1965) and the Who's The Who Sell Out (December 1967) as other examples of early concept albums. Brian Boyd of The Irish Times names the Kinks' Face to Face (October 1966) as the first concept album: \"Written entirely by Ray Davies, the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It’s not one of the band’s finest works, but it did have an impact.\"\n\n1960s–70s: Rock operas and progressive rock\n\n \n\nAuthor Bill Martin relates the assumed concept albums of the 1960s to progressive rock:\n\nPopmatters Sarah Zupko notes that while the Who's Tommy is \"popularly thought of as the first rock opera, an extra-long concept album with characters, a consistent storyline, and a slight bit of pomposity\", it is preceded by the shorter concept albums Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (Small Faces, 1968) and S.F. Sorrow (The Pretty Things, 1968). Author Jim Cullen states: \"The concept album reached its apogee in the 1970s in ambitious records like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and the Eagles' Hotel California (1977).\" In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Dark Side of the Moon number one among the 50 greatest prog albums of all-time, also noting the LP's stature as the second best-selling album of all time. Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), a semi-autobiographical story modeled after the band's Roger Waters and Syd Barrett, is one of the most famous concept albums by any artist. In addition to The Wall, Danesi highlights Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) and Zappa's Joe's Garage (1979) as other culturally significant concept albums.\n\nAccording to author Edward Macan, concept albums as a recurrent theme in progressive rock was directly inspired by the counterculture associated with \"the proto-progressive bands of the 1960s\", observing: \"the consistent use of lengthy forms such as the programmatic song cycle of the concept album and the multimovement suite underscores the hippies' new, drug-induced conception of time.\"\n\n1980s–present: Decline and return to popularity\n\nWith the emergence of MTV as a music video network which valued single over album, concept albums became less dominant in the 1980s. Some artists, however, still released concept albums and experienced success in the 1990s and 2000s. NMEs Emily Barker cites Green Day's American Idiot (2004) as one of the \"more notable\" examples, having brought the concept album back to high-charting positions. Dorian Lynskey, writing for GQ, noted a resurgence of concept albums in the 2010s due to streaming: \"This is happening not in spite of the rise of streaming and playlists, but because of it. Threatened with redundancy in the digital era, albums have fought back by becoming more album-like.\" Cucchiara argues that \"concept albums\" should also describe \"this new generation of concept albums, for one key reason. This is because the unison between the songs on a particular album has now been expanded into a broader field of visual and artistic design and marketing strategies that play into the themes and stories that form the album.\"\n\nNotes",
