He met his wife, French citizen Josie Dumont, on a blind date in Belgium not long after the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAtlas and Archie\n\nDeCarlo was married, with a pregnant wife, and a laborer working for his father when he began to pursue a professional art career. Circa 1947, answering an ad, he broke into the comic book industry at Timely Comics, the 1940s iteration of Marvel Comics. Under editor-in-chief Stan Lee, his first assignment was the teen-humor series Jeanie. DeCarlo went uncredited, as was typical for most comic-book writers and artists of the era, and he recalled in 2001, \"I went on with her maybe ten books. They used to call me 'The Jeanie Machine' because that was all Stan used to give me, was Jeanie.... Then he took me off Jeannie and he gave me Millie the Model. That was a big break for me.

At the time of their meeting, Dumont did not speak any English, while DeCarlo, a member of the U.S. Army during World War II, spoke very little French.\n\nUnable to have a conversation due to their language barrier, Dumont and DeCarlo communicated through his cartoons. In a later interview, Josie explained their early courtship, \"We communicated with drawing...He would draw things for me to make me understand what he had in mind. He was really so amusing.
