Kahlúa was Hispanicized as Ulúa, forming the name of the modern San Juan de Ulúa fortress.\n\nThe company merged in 1994 with Allied Lyons to become Allied Domecq. In turn, that company was partially acquired in 2005 by Pernod Ricard, the largest spirits distributor in the world since its merger with the Swedish Vin & Sprit in March 2008.\n\nSince 2004, the alcohol content of Kahlúa is 20.0%; earlier versions had 26.5%.[http://www.brandhot.de/spirituosen/kahlua-black-russian/205/ Kahlúa ad from 1975] Retrieved 2011-02-12.
