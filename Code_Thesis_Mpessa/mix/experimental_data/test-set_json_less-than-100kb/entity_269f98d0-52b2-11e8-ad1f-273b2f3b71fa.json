  "textBody" : "Jacques Dupuis (5 December 1923 – 28 December 2004) was a Belgian Jesuit priest and theologian. He spent several decades in India and beginning in 1984 taught at the Pontifical Gregorian  University in Rome.\n\nCareer\n\nJacques Dupuis became a Jesuit in 1941. After early religious and academic training in Belgium he left for India in 1948. A 3-year (1948–51) teaching experience at St. Xavier's Collegiate School, Calcutta, made him discover Hinduism through the way it shaped the personalities of the students entrusted to him. This was a discovery - the variety of religions -, and the beginning of a lifelong search: \"does God self revelation necessarily pass for all through the person of Jesus Christ?\"Cf.

He was assigned to teach Dogmatic Theology at the Jesuit Faculty of Theology of Kurseong (later shifted to Delhi, and renamed 'Vidyajyoti College of Theology').Cf.

Besides numerous articles on theological and inter-religious topics, he published in 1973 (with Josef Neuner) a collection of Church documents, 'The Christian Faith', that went into seven editions over 20 years: an invaluable instrument of theological learning for generations of students of Catholicism.Cf. [http://sedosmission.org/old/eng/dupuis_1.htm \"Jesus with an Asian Face\"], on Sedosmission.org of August–September 1999.\n\nIn 1984, after 36 years in India, Dupuis was called to teach Theology and Non-Christian Religions at the Gregorian University of Rome. His book Jésus-Christ à la rencontre des religions (1989) was well received and promptly translated in Italian, English and Spanish. He was made director of the journal Gregorianum and appointed consultor at the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.\n\nUnder investigation\n\nIn 2001, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a department of the Roman Curia, determined that his book Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism contained ambiguities that present \"difficulties on important doctrinal points\" with respect to the proper understanding of \"the seeds of truth and goodness that exist in other religions\".\n\nDupuis was told to clarify his position in relation to that document, but he was never disciplined. Future editions of his book had to include a copy of the Congregation's notification about areas in which it considered his work unclear. A visitor reported in 2003 that \"the ordeal he went through with the C.D.F. had caused havoc to his mental and physical health.\" The notification stated: \"It is consistent with Catholic doctrine to hold that the seeds of truth and goodness that exist in other religions are a certain participation in truths contained in the revelation of or in Jesus Christ. However, it is erroneous to hold that such elements of truth and goodness, or some of them, do not derive ultimately from the source-mediation of Jesus Christ.\"[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010124_dupuis_en.html NOTIFICATION on the book \"Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism\" (Orbis Books: Maryknoll, New York 1997) by Father JACQUES DUPUIS, S.J.]\n\nSubsequently, however, Dupuis's 'pioneering' work was highly praised on the meaning of other religions in \"God's plan of salvation of mankind\".Cf.

Accessed 5 December 2012\n\nJacques Dupuis died a few days after celebrating 50 years of priesthood, in Rome, on 28 December 2004.\n\nChristology \n\nMany theologians argue for a Christology that is expressly based on the Trinity and an understanding of the interpersonal relationships between Father and Son and between Son and Holy Spirit. In Jacques Dupuis’ Who Do You Say I Am?, he argues that, within the one person of Jesus Christ, we can distinguish between his two natures, human and divine, and thus between the operations of his uncreated divine nature and his created finite human nature.\n\nIn order to properly phrase the relationship between Jesus Christ and the Father, Dupuis utilizes different terms to describe aspects of Christ’s divine and human nature.  Instead of “absolute” and “definitive”, Dupuis speaks in terms of “constitutive” and “universal”.  In this way, Dupuis tries to lead the discussion away from dealing in absolutes.\n\nDupuis emphasizes that Jesus’ constitutive uniqueness as universal Savior rests on his personal identity as the Son of God.\n\nBooks\n\n* Jesus Christ at the Encounter of World Religions, 1991\n* Introduzione alla cristologia, 1993\n* Who Do You Say I Am?: Introduction to Christology, 1994\n* Toward a Christian theology of religious pluralism, 1997\n* Christianity and the religions, 2002\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography \n\n* The Christian Faith, Alba House New York (1973).\n* Jesus-Christ at the encounter of World Religions (1991).\n* Who do you say I am ?
