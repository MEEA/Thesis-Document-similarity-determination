  "textBody" : "The Federation of Expellees or Bund der Vertriebenen (BdV) is a non-profit organization formed in West Germany on 27 October 1957 to represent the interests of German nationals of all ethnicities and foreign ethnic Germans (usually naturalised as German nationals after 1949) who either fled their homes in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, or were forcibly expelled following World War II, and their families.\n\nSince 2014 the president of the Federation has been Bernd Fabritius, a Christian Social Union in Bavaria politician.\n\nHistorical background\n\nIt is estimated that in the aftermath of World War II between 13 and 16 million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including the former eastern territories of Germany (parts of present-day Poland), the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia (mostly from the Vojvodina region), the Kaliningrad Oblast of (now) Russia, hitherto USSR (in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War) and prior to this, the northern part of East Prussia, Lithuania, Romania and other East European countries.\n\nCharter of the German Expellees\n\nThe Charter of the German Expellees () of August 5, 1950, announced their belief in requiring that \"the right to the homeland is recognized and carried out as one of the fundamental rights of mankind given by God\", while renouncing revenge and retaliation in the face of the \"unending suffering\" (unendliche Leid) of the previous decade, and supporting the unified effort to rebuild Germany and Europe. \n\nThe charter has been criticised for avoiding mentioning Nazi atrocities of Second World War and Germans who were forced to emigrate due to Nazi repressions. Beata Ociepka, \"Związek Wypędzonych w systemie politycznym RFN i jego wpływ na stosunki polsko-niemieckie 1982-1992\", page 235, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego, 1997 Critics argue that the Charter presents the history of German people as starting from the expulsions, while ignoring events like the Holocaust. \n\nProfessor Micha Brumlik pointed out that one third of signatories were former devoted Nazis and many actively helped in realisation of Hitler's goals. \n\nRalph Giordano wrote in Hamburger Abendblatt \"the Charter doesn't contain a word about Hitler, Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Not to mention any sign of apologies for the suffering of the murdered people\", \"avoids mentioning the reasons for expulsions\" and called the document \"example of German art of crowding out the truth (...) The fact that the charter completely ignores the reasons for the expulsions deprives it of any value\".[http://www.dw.de/karta-wypędzonych-pojednanie-czy-relatywizacja/a-5870536 Karta Wypędzonych: pojednanie czy relatywizacja? Deutsche Welle]\n\nGerman laws concerning the expellees\n\nBetween 1953, when the Federal Expellee Law was passed, and 1991, the West German government passed several laws dealing with German expellees. The most notable of these is the \"Law of Return\" which granted German citizenship to any ethnic German. Several additions were later made to these laws.\n\nThe German Law of Return declared refugee status to be inheritable. According to the Federal Expellee Law,[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/bvfg/index.html \"Gesetz über die Angelegenheiten der Vertriebenen und Flüchtlinge\"] Par. 7/2. Retrieved 29-10-2017 \"the spouse and the descendants\" of an expellee are to be treated as if they were expellees themselves, regardless of whether they had been personally displaced. The Federation of Expellees has steadily lobbied to preserve the inheritability clause.\n\nFormation of the Federation\n\nThe Federation of Expellees was formed on 27 October 1957 in West Germany. Before its founding, the Bund der Heimatvertriebenen (League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights), formed in 1950, represented the interests of displaced German expellees. Intriguingly, in its first few years, the league was more successful in West Germany than in East Germany.\n\nGerman reunification\n\nPrevious West German governments, especially those led by the Christian Democratic Union, had shown more rhetorical support for the territorial claims made on behalf of German refugees and expellees. Although the Social Democrats showed strong support for the expellees, especially under Kurt Schumacher and Erich Ollenhauer, Social Democrats in more recent decades have generally been less supportive — and it was under Willy Brandt that West Germany recognized the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern German border with Poland under his policy of Ostpolitik. In reality, accepting the internationally recognized boundary made it more possible for eastern Germans to visit their lost homelands.\n\nIn 1989-1990 the West German government realized they had an opportunity to reunify the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet created German Democratic Republic. But they believed that if this were to be achieved, it had to be done quickly. One of the potential complications was the claim to the historical eastern territories of Germany; unless this was renounced, some foreign governments might not agree to German reunification. The West German government under the CDU accepted the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany (Two Plus Four Agreement), which officially re-established the sovereignty of both German states. A condition of this agreement was that Germany accept the post-World War II frontiers. Upon reunification in 1990, the constitution was amended to state that Germany's territory had reached its full extent. Article 146 was amended so that Article 23 of the current constitution could be used for reunification. Once the five \"reestablished federal states\" in the east had been united with the west, the Basic Law was amended again to show that there were no other parts of Germany, which existed outside of the unified territory, that had not acceded.\n\nRecent developments\n\nIn 2000 the Federation of Expellees also initiated the formation of the Center Against Expulsions (). Chairwoman of this Center is Erika Steinbach, who headed it together with former SPD politician Prof. Dr. Peter Glotz (died 2005).\n\nRecently Erika Steinbach, the chair of the Federation of Expellees, has rejected any compensation claims. The vice president of the Federation Rudi Pawelka is however a chairman of the supervisory board of the Prussian Trust.\n\nA European organisation for expellees has been formed: EUFV. Headquarters is Trieste, Italy. \n\nOrganization\n\nThe expellees are organized in 21 regional associations (Landsmannschaften), according to the areas of origin of its members, 16 state organizations (Landesverbände) according to their current residence, and 5 associate member organizations. It is the single representative federation for the approximately 15 million Germans who after fleeing, being expelled, evacuated or emigrating, found refuge in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Federation claims to have 1.3 million members (including non-displaced persons),  and to be a political force of some influence in Germany. This figure was disputed in January 2010 by the German news service DDP, which reported an actual membership of 550,000.Reported by ARD News service in January 2010. The figure of 550,000 does not include the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  The news report mentioned that an expert in the area of Expellees Prof. Matthias Stickler of the University Würzburg as saying that a decline in BdV membership is understandable because it \"mirrors the death of the generation of that era\"[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bdvmitglieder100.html] According to Erika Steinbach only 100,000 of the members contribute financially.

Many of the members assist the societies of their place of birth.\n\nPresidents\n\nFrom 1959 to 1964, the first president of the Federation was Hans Krüger, a former Nazi judge and activist.[http://www.dw.com/en/league-of-german-expellees-unwilling-to-investigate-own-past/a-2135984 \"League of German Expellees Unwilling to Investigate Own Past\"], Deutsche Welle (14 August 2006).

The issue of the eastern border and the return of the Heimatvertriebene to their ancestral homes are matters which the current German government, German constitutional arrangements and German treaty obligations have virtually closed.\n\nThe refugees' claims were unanimously rejected by the affected countries and became a source of mistrust between Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. These governments argue that the expulsion of Germans and related border changes were not enacted by the Polish or Czech governments, but rather were ordered by the Potsdam Conference. Furthermore, the nationalization of private property by Poland's former communist government did not apply only to Germans but was enforced on all people, regardless of ethnic background. A further complication is that many of the current Polish population in historical eastern Germany are themselves expellees (or descendants of expellees) who were driven from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union and were forced to leave their homes and property behind as well.\n\nSome Germans had settled in Poland after 1939, and treating these ex-colonists as expellees, Erika Steinbach included, under German law of these ex-colonists as expellees, adds to the controversy. However, the vast majority of expelled Germans were descended from families who had lived in Eastern Europe for many centuries, while the majority of German colonists in Nazi-occupied Poland were Baltic and other East European Germans themselves displaced by the Nazi-Soviet population transfers.\n\nNazi background\n\nThe Federation has been always accused (e.g. by the GDR and Poland) to have Nazi roots. A recent study confirms the stereotype: 13 members of the first council of the Federation had a Nazi past.\n\nThe large Polish daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported that during BdV meetings in 2003, publications using hate-language to describe Poles butchering Germans were available for sale, as were recordings of Waffen SS marches on compact disks, including those glorifying the Invasion of Poland. Also, far right groups openly distributed their materials at BdV meetings. While the BdV officially denied responsibility for this, no steps were taken to address the concerns raised.\n\nIn February 2009, the Polish newspaper Polska wrote that over one third of the Federation top officials were former Nazi activists, and based this on an article published by the German magazine Der Spiegel in 2006. The German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Der Spiegel said this not in respect to the Federation of Expellees, but in respect to a predecessor organization that was dissolved in 1957.
