  "textBody" : "This article is about the demographic features of the population of Mauritius, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nMauritian society includes people from many different ethnic groups. A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from the Indian subcontinent. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental Africa, China, France, Great Britain and the East African island nation of Madagascar among other places.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nThe majority of the population are Indo-Mauritians (people of Indian descent) who make up 68% of the population. Creoles (of African descent or mixed-race) are about a quarter of the population.  There are approximately 30,000 Sino-Mauritians from the Hakka and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups.\n\nFranco-Mauritians (Mauritian of French ancestry) are numbered about 13,000. The Franco-Mauritian group, mostly are the descendants of former slave-owners,  comprises the largest group of people of European origin on the island. There is a smaller population of people of British descent living in Mauritius, most of whom have Mauritian nationality. The term Anglo-Mauritian, which may also include Mauritians living in the UK, is used unofficially.\nThere's also a substantial new arrivals of white South Africans, numbering about 20,000, and is a growing community.\n\nWhile within the Mauritian social context, the main ethnic groups are refer to as the following: Hindus or Indians (North Indians Hindus) 40% (520,000), residing all over the Island, with higher concentration in the North. Creoles (Afro or Afro-Indian) 22% (286,000), mostly central plateau area, the suburbs of Port Louis and coastal villages such as Bai du Tombeau and the black river region. Muslims (Indo-Muslims) 16%(208,000), most living in the central plateau towns and Plaine Verte in the capital city. Tamils or South Indians (Tamils or Christian-Tamils) 14.5%(188,500), concentrated in the central plateau towns. Gens de Couleur or coloured creoles 3%(39,000) mostly Rose-Hill-Beau Basin, coastal villages of Albion and Tamarin and also Montagne Blanche. Chinese or Sino-Mauritian 2%(26,000), mostly in Port Louis. white/Franco-Mauritians 1%(13,000), reside in three main towns, Tamarin in the South west coast, Curepipe in the centre of the Island and in the North mostly in and around pointe aux canonniers. White South Africans 1.5% (22,000), live exclusively in coastal town of Tamarin and black river region.\n\nWhile the government officially groups Mauritians in four ethnic groups: Hindus, Muslims, Chinese and General population. The general population gathers all that don't practice the Hindu or Muslim religion, or are not Chinese by race. Hence general population is the Christian community, which includes whites, coloureds, blacks, and a good amount of those of Indian ancestry especially Tamils who have converted to Christianity. The exception to the rule is that the general population does not include the Christian-Chinese, although 90% are Christians.\n\nNote since independence nearly 60% of the Coloured community (51,000), 60% of the whites (17,000), 50% of the Chinese (26,000), and further 26,000 Afro-creoles and Christian-Tamils have departed; coloureds mostly to Australia, whites or near white coloureds (pass as whites) to South Africa, Chinese to Canada and Afro-Creoles and Christian Tamils mostly Europe/U.K. There is 200,000 Mauritians living outside of Mauritius of which 120,000 people are Christians, representing the majority in the diaspora at 60%.\n\nSmall groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present.  Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbour-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to  the total population was  in , compared to 479,000 in 1950.\n\nThe proportion of the population aged under 15 was 21.9% in 2010. 71.2% were between 15 and 65 years of age, with 6.9% being 65 years or older.\n\nStructure of the population \n\nStructure of the population (04.07.2011) (Census, complete tabulation) :\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2012) (Estimates based on the results of the 2011 Population Census) :\n\nVital statistics \n\nMauritius has an estimated population of 1,283,415 on December 31, 2010. 14,701 children were born in 2011 (birth rate 11.4 per 1,000).\n\nThe table below presents the population development of Mauritius since 1900. The figure up to 1945 are for the island of Mauritius only. As of 1946 the island of Rodrigues is included.\n\nFigures from Statistics Mauritius and United Nations Demographic Yearbook.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe main languages spoken in Mauritius are English, French and Mauritian Creole. There is no official language. English is the official language of the parliament, though French is also permitted. However, the lingua franca is Mauritian Creole and the newspapers and television programs are usually in French.\n\nMauritian Créole, which is spoken by 90 percent of the population, is considered to be the native language of the country and is used most often in informal settings. It was developed in the 18th century by slaves who used a pidgin language to communicate with each other as well as with their French masters, who did not understand the various African languages. The pidgin evolved with later generations to become a casual language.\n\nMauritian Creole is a French-based creole due to its close ties with French pronunciation and vocabulary. Bhojpuri is also spoken by a large percentage of Mauritian people at home and in informal scenarios., p.353.\n\nAround 10,000 people can speak the Tamil language and many children are started to learn the language.\n\nReligion\n\nThe religions present in the republic are Hinduism 51.9%, Roman Catholicism 25.1%, Other Christian 5.3%, Islam 15.3%, None 0.7%, Other 0.6, Unspecified 0.1%\n\nMore than 90% of the Sino-Mauritian community are Christian; the remainder are largely Buddhist.\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics \n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nPopulation growth rate:\n0.776% (2010 est.)\n\nSex ratio:\nat birth\n1 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years:\n1.03 male(s)/female\n15–64 years:\n0.99 male(s)/female\n65 years and over:\n0.67 male(s)/female\ntotal population:\n0.98 male(s)/female (2000 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate:\n17.73 deaths/1,000 live births (2000 est.) - 12.2 deaths/1,000 live births (2010 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population:\n74 years\nmale:\n70.53 years\nfemale:\n77.65 years (2010 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n2.02 children born/woman (2000 est.)\n1.80 children born/woman (2010 est.)\n\nNationality:\nnoun:\nMauritian(s)\nadjective:\nMauritian\n\nEthnic groups: \n\nIndian 68%\nCreole 27%\nChinese 3%\nFrench  2%\n\nReligions:\n\nHinduism 48.5%\nRoman Catholicism 26.3%\nOther Christian 6.4%\nIslam 17.3%\nNone 0.7%\nOther 0.6\nUnspecified 0.1%\n\nLanguages:\n\nCreole 86.5%\nBhojpuri 5.3%\nFrench 4.1%, \nTwo languages 1.4%, \nOther 2.6% (includes English, which is spoken by less than 1% of the population)\nUnspecified 0.1% (2011 est.)\n\nLiteracy:\ndefinition:\nage 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population:\n84.4%\nmale:\n88.4%\nfemale:\n80.5% (2000 est.)",
