  "textBody" : "The Capetian dynasty, also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet. It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. That line was succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and then Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution.\n\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own demesne, the Île-de-France, the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see Crown lands of France.\n\nMembers of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic. The early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings – Louis VII, Philip Augustus, Louis VIII, Saint Louis, and Philip III. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the Aragonese Crusade. Philip III's son and successor, Philip IV, humiliated a pope and brought the papacy under French control. The later Valois, starting with Francis I, ignored religious differences and allied with the Ottoman Sultan to counter the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\n\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given appanages for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. Through this, the Capetians spread widely over Europe.\n\nIn modern times, both King Felipe VI of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg are members of this family, both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty. Along with the House of Habsburg, it was one of the two most powerful continental European royal families, dominating European politics for nearly five centuries.\n\nName origins and usage \n\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, Hugh, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word caput (\"head\"), and thus explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".\n\nHistorians in the 19th century (see House of France) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the House of Capet. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the House of Bourbon and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and Queen Marie Antoinette (a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\n\nThe Robertians and before \n\nThe dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is \"Robertians\" or \"Robertines.\" The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, Robert the Strong (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of Robert III of Worms (b. 800) and grandson of Robert of Hesbaye (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county Hesbaye, around Tongeren in modern-day Belgium.\n\nThe sons of Robert the Strong were Odo and Robert, who both ruled as king of Western Francia. The family became Counts of Paris under Odo and Dukes of the Franks under Robert, possessing large parts of Neustria.\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of Louis V. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, Hugh Capet, was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at Noyon on 3 July 987 with the full support from Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the Capetians, with the Capetian dynasty ruling France for more than 800 years (987–1848, with some interruptionsSpecific periods of reign are 888–898, 922–923, 987–1792, 1814–1815, and 1815–1848 – the more-than-800-year uninterrupted period 987–1792 forming the bulk.).\n\nRobertian family branches \n\n*Rodbert\n**Ingerman of Hesbaye\n***Ermengarde of Hesbaye, wife of Louis the Pious\n**Cancor, founder of the Lorsch Abbey\n***Heimrich (−795), count in the Lahngau\n****Poppo of Grapfeld (−839/41), ancestor of the Frankish House of Babenberg\n**Landrada\n***Saint Chrodogang, Archbishop of Metz, Abbot of the Lorsch Abbey\n**Robert of Hesbaye\n***Robert III of Worms\n****Robert the Strong\n*****Odo, king of Western Francia\n*****Richildis, married to a count of Troyes\n*****Robert, king of Western Francia\n******Emma, married Rudolph of Burgundy\n******Adela, married Herbert II, Count of Vermandois\n******Hugh the Great\n*******Hugh Capet, founder House of Capet\n********Hadwig, married Reginar IV, Count of Mons\n********Robert II\n*******Otto-Henry\n*******Odo\n*******Beatrix, married Frederick of Bar\n*******Emma, married Richard I of Normandy\n*******Herbert, bishop of Auxerre\n\nCapetians through history \n\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors.\n\nSalic law \n\nSalic law, reestablished during the Hundred Years' War from an ancient Frankish tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male (agnatic) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\n\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of John I, the crown would have passed to his half-sister, Joan (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\n\nIn 1328, King Charles IV of France died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. Philip of Valois, the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\n\nThus the French crown passed from the House of Capet after the death of Charles IV to Philip VI of France of the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty,\n*then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became Louis XII of France,\n*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became Francis I of France, and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème,\n*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became Henry IV of France, of the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.\n\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, Navarre, and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available below.\n\nCapetian cadet branches \n\nThe Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.\n\n* Hugh Capet\n**  Robert II of

However, since primogeniture and the Salic law provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the Legitimist pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as Robertians, not Capetians.\n\nNoblemen in Neustria and their descendants (dates uncertain):\n* Cheribert (Until 636)\n* Chrodobertus (From 636)\n* Lambert I (Until 650)\n* Chrodobertus (650–653)\n* Lambert II (653–741)\n\nCount in the Upper Rhine Valley and Wormgau:\n* Rutpert I (741–757)\n* Thuringbert (757–770)\n* Rutpert II (770–807)\n* Rutpert III (807 -834)\n* Rutpert IV (834–866)\n\nKing of France:\n* Odo (866–898)\n* Robert I (898–923)\n\nCount of Paris:\n* Hugh (923–956)\n\nKing of France:\n* Hugh (987–996)\n* Robert II (996–1031)\n* Henry I (1031–1060)\n* Philip I (1060–1108)\n* Louis VI (1108–1137)\n* Louis VII (1137–1180)\n* Philip II (1180–1223)\n* Louis VIII (1223–1226)\n* Louis IX (1226–1270)\n* Philip III (1271–1285)\n* Philip IV (1285–1314)\n* Louis X (1314–1316)\n* John I (1316)\n* Philip V (1316–1322)\n* Charles IV (1322–1328)\n* Philip VI (1328–1350)\n* John II (1350–1364)\n* Charles V (1364–1380)\n* Charles VI (1380–1422)\n* Charles VII (1422–1461)\n* Louis XI (1461–1483)\n* Charles VIII (1483–1498)\n* Louis XII (1498–1515)\n* Francis I (1515–1547)\n* Henry II (1547–1559)\n* Francis II (1559–1560)\n* Charles IX (1560–1574)\n* Henry III (1574–1589)\n* Henry IV (1589–1610)\n* Louis XIII (1610–1643)\n* Louis XIV (1643–1715)\n* Louis XV (1715–1774)\n* Louis XVI (1774–1793)\n* Louis XVII (1793–1795)\n* Louis XVIII (1795–1824)\n* Charles X (1824–1836)\n\nDuke of Angoulême:\n*Louis XIX (1836–1844)\n\nCount of Chambord:\n*Henri (1844–1883)\n\nCount of Montizón:\n*Juan (1883–1887)\n\t \nDuke of Madrid:\n*Carlos (1887–1909)\n\t \nDuke of Anjou and Madrid:\n*Jacques (1909–1931)\n\t \nDuke of San Jaime:\n*Alfonso Carlos (1931–1936)\n\t \nKing of Spain:\n*Alfonso XIII (1936–1941)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou and Segovia:\n*Jacques Henri (1941–1975)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou and Cádiz:\n*Alphonse (1975–1989)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou:\n*Louis (1989–present)\n\nThe Capetian dynasty today \n\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, known by his supporters as Duke of Anjou, who also holds the Legitimist (Blancs d'Espagne) claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\n\nExcept for the House of Braganza (founded by an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\n\nCurrent Capetian rulers \n\n* Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (since 2000)\n*Felipe VI, King of Spain (since 2014)\n\nCurrent Capetian pretenders \n\n* Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, Legitimist (Blancs d'Espagne) pretender to France since 1989.\n* Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria, Calabrian pretender to the Two Sicilies since 2015.\n* Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, Castroist pretender to the Two Sicilies since 2008.\n* Carlos, Duke of Parma, pretender to Parma since 2010.\n* Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Carlist pretender to Spain since 1979.\n* Henri, Count of Paris, Legitimist (Blancs d'Eu) and Orléanist pretender to France since 1999.\n* Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, Petrópolis pretender to Brazil since 2007.\n* Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.\n* Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, pretender to Portugal since 1976.\n\nCurrent numbers \n\nIt is estimated that the agnatic descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people (dead and alive).\n\nThe small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries. Some examples of considerable inbreeding among descendants of the kings of France are:\n\n*Alfonso XIII of Spain, who, instead of having 1024 ancestors in the 11th generation, only had 111 distinct ancestors; \n*Louis XIV of France is descended 368 times from Saint Louis (out of his total 1159 ancestors in the 12th generation); and\n*The four grandparents of the Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999) were all of the House of Orleans, all cousins and all grandchildren of Louis Philippe I.\n\nArms of cadet branches",

    "aggregatedText" : "The Capetian dynasty, also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet. It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. That line was succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and then Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution.\n\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own demesne, the Île-de-France, the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see Crown lands of France.\n\nMembers of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic. The early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings – Louis VII, Philip Augustus, Louis VIII, Saint Louis, and Philip III. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the Aragonese Crusade. Philip III's son and successor, Philip IV, humiliated a pope and brought the papacy under French control. The later Valois, starting with Francis I, ignored religious differences and allied with the Ottoman Sultan to counter the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\n\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given appanages for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. Through this, the Capetians spread widely over Europe.\n\nIn modern times, both King Felipe VI of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg are members of this family, both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty. Along with the House of Habsburg, it was one of the two most powerful continental European royal families, dominating European politics for nearly five centuries.\n\nName origins and usage \n\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, Hugh, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word caput (\"head\"), and thus explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".\n\nHistorians in the 19th century (see House of France) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the House of Capet. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the House of Bourbon and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and Queen Marie Antoinette (a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\n\nThe Robertians and before \n\nThe dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is \"Robertians\" or \"Robertines.\" The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, Robert the Strong (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of Robert III of Worms (b. 800) and grandson of Robert of Hesbaye (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county Hesbaye, around Tongeren in modern-day Belgium.\n\nThe sons of Robert the Strong were Odo and Robert, who both ruled as king of Western Francia. The family became Counts of Paris under Odo and Dukes of the Franks under Robert, possessing large parts of Neustria.\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of Louis V. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, Hugh Capet, was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at Noyon on 3 July 987 with the full support from Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the Capetians, with the Capetian dynasty ruling France for more than 800 years (987–1848, with some interruptionsSpecific periods of reign are 888–898, 922–923, 987–1792, 1814–1815, and 1815–1848 – the more-than-800-year uninterrupted period 987–1792 forming the bulk.).\n\nRobertian family branches \n\n*Rodbert\n**Ingerman of Hesbaye\n***Ermengarde of Hesbaye, wife of Louis the Pious\n**Cancor, founder of the Lorsch Abbey\n***Heimrich (−795), count in the Lahngau\n****Poppo of Grapfeld (−839/41), ancestor of the Frankish House of Babenberg\n**Landrada\n***Saint Chrodogang, Archbishop of Metz, Abbot of the Lorsch Abbey\n**Robert of Hesbaye\n***Robert III of Worms\n****Robert the Strong\n*****Odo, king of Western Francia\n*****Richildis, married to a count of Troyes\n*****Robert, king of Western Francia\n******Emma, married Rudolph of Burgundy\n******Adela, married Herbert II, Count of Vermandois\n******Hugh the Great\n*******Hugh Capet, founder House of Capet\n********Hadwig, married Reginar IV, Count of Mons\n********Robert II\n*******Otto-Henry\n*******Odo\n*******Beatrix, married Frederick of Bar\n*******Emma, married Richard I of Normandy\n*******Herbert, bishop of Auxerre\n\nCapetians through history \n\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors.\n\nSalic law \n\nSalic law, reestablished during the Hundred Years' War from an ancient Frankish tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male (agnatic) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\n\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of John I, the crown would have passed to his half-sister, Joan (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\n\nIn 1328, King Charles IV of France died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. Philip of Valois, the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\n\nThus the French crown passed from the House of Capet after the death of Charles IV to Philip VI of France of the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty,\n*then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became Louis XII of France,\n*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became Francis I of France, and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème,\n*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became Henry IV of France, of the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.\n\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, Navarre, and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available below.\n\nCapetian cadet branches \n\nThe Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.\n\n* Hugh Capet\n**  Robert II of

Only in the time before Hugh Capet took the crown for himself and after the reign of Charles X is the term necessary to identify which. However, since primogeniture and the Salic law provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the Legitimist pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as Robertians, not Capetians.\n\nNoblemen in Neustria and their descendants (dates uncertain):\n* Cheribert (Until 636)\n* Chrodobertus (From 636)\n* Lambert I (Until 650)\n* Chrodobertus (650–653)\n* Lambert II (653–741)\n\nCount in the Upper Rhine Valley and Wormgau:\n* Rutpert I (741–757)\n* Thuringbert (757–770)\n* Rutpert II (770–807)\n* Rutpert III (807 -834)\n* Rutpert IV (834–866)\n\nKing of France:\n* Odo (866–898)\n* Robert I (898–923)\n\nCount of Paris:\n* Hugh (923–956)\n\nKing of France:\n* Hugh (987–996)\n* Robert II (996–1031)\n* Henry I (1031–1060)\n* Philip I (1060–1108)\n* Louis VI (1108–1137)\n* Louis VII (1137–1180)\n* Philip II (1180–1223)\n* Louis VIII (1223–1226)\n* Louis IX (1226–1270)\n* Philip III (1271–1285)\n* Philip IV (1285–1314)\n* Louis X (1314–1316)\n* John I (1316)\n* Philip V (1316–1322)\n* Charles IV (1322–1328)\n* Philip VI (1328–1350)\n* John II (1350–1364)\n* Charles V (1364–1380)\n* Charles VI (1380–1422)\n* Charles VII (1422–1461)\n* Louis XI (1461–1483)\n* Charles VIII (1483–1498)\n* Louis XII (1498–1515)\n* Francis I (1515–1547)\n* Henry II (1547–1559)\n* Francis II (1559–1560)\n* Charles IX (1560–1574)\n* Henry III (1574–1589)\n* Henry IV (1589–1610)\n* Louis XIII (1610–1643)\n* Louis XIV (1643–1715)\n* Louis XV (1715–1774)\n* Louis XVI (1774–1793)\n* Louis XVII (1793–1795)\n* Louis XVIII (1795–1824)\n* Charles X (1824–1836)\n\nDuke of Angoulême:\n*Louis XIX (1836–1844)\n\nCount of Chambord:\n*Henri (1844–1883)\n\nCount of Montizón:\n*Juan (1883–1887)\n\t \nDuke of Madrid:\n*Carlos (1887–1909)\n\t \nDuke of Anjou and Madrid:\n*Jacques (1909–1931)\n\t \nDuke of San Jaime:\n*Alfonso Carlos (1931–1936)\n\t \nKing of Spain:\n*Alfonso XIII (1936–1941)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou and Segovia:\n*Jacques Henri (1941–1975)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou and Cádiz:\n*Alphonse (1975–1989)\n\t\nDuke of Anjou:\n*Louis (1989–present)\n\nThe Capetian dynasty today \n\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, known by his supporters as Duke of Anjou, who also holds the Legitimist (Blancs d'Espagne) claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\n\nExcept for the House of Braganza (founded by an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\n\nCurrent Capetian rulers \n\n* Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (since 2000)\n*Felipe VI, King of Spain (since 2014)\n\nCurrent Capetian pretenders \n\n* Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, Legitimist (Blancs d'Espagne) pretender to France since 1989.\n* Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria, Calabrian pretender to the Two Sicilies since 2015.\n* Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, Castroist pretender to the Two Sicilies since 2008.\n* Carlos, Duke of Parma, pretender to Parma since 2010.\n* Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Carlist pretender to Spain since 1979.\n* Henri, Count of Paris, Legitimist (Blancs d'Eu) and Orléanist pretender to France since 1999.\n* Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, Petrópolis pretender to Brazil since 2007.\n* Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.\n* Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, pretender to Portugal since 1976.\n\nCurrent numbers \n\nIt is estimated that the agnatic descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people (dead and alive).\n\nThe small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries. Some examples of considerable inbreeding among descendants of the kings of France are:\n\n*Alfonso XIII of Spain, who, instead of having 1024 ancestors in the 11th generation, only had 111 distinct ancestors; \n*Louis XIV of France is descended 368 times from Saint Louis (out of his total 1159 ancestors in the 12th generation); and\n*The four grandparents of the Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999) were all of the House of Orleans, all cousins and all grandchildren of Louis Philippe I.\n\nArms of cadet branches.
