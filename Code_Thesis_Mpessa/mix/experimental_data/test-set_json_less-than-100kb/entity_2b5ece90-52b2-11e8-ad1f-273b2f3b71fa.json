  "textBody" : "Khartoum ( ) is the capital and largest city of Sudan and the state of Khartoum. It is located at the confluence of the White Nile, flowing north from Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Ethiopia. The location where the two Niles meet is known as \"al-Mogran\" ('). The main Nile continues to flow north towards Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nDivided by the two Rivers Nile, Khartoum is a tripartite metropolis with an estimated overall population of over five million people, consisting of Khartoum proper, and linked by bridges to Khartoum North ( ') and Omdurman ( ') to the west.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the word, \"Khartoum\", is uncertain. One theory argues that khartoum is derived from Arabic khurṭūm ( '), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. Dinka scholars argue that the name derives from the Dinka words \"Khier-tuom\" which translates to a \"place where rivers meet\". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan as late as the 13th-15th centuries A.D.  Captain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic qurtum ( ', i.e., Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word, Agartum (\"the abode of Atum\"), the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest \"Khartoum\" is derived from the Beja word, Hartoom (\"meeting\"). Additionally, the dream-interpreting magicians in Genesis 41:8 are referred to as  חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י מצרים(\"Khartoumei Mitzrayim\" - Magicians of Egypt). There is some speculation that they learned their craft at an academy in the south of Egypt from which the city takes its name. \n\nFounding (1821–1899)\n\nIn 1821, Khartoum was established 15 mi north of the ancient city of Soba, by Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army, but the settlement quickly grew into a regional centre of trade. It also became a focal point for the slave trade. Later, it became the administrative center of Sudan and official capital.\n\nOn 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad started a siege of Khartoum, against defenders led by British General Charles George Gordon. The siege ended in a massacre of the Anglo-Egyptian garrison when on 26 January 1885 the heavily-damaged city fell to the Mahdists.\n\nOn 2 September 1898, Omdurman was the scene of the bloody Battle of Omdurman, during which British forces under Herbert Kitchener defeated the Mahdist forces defending the city.\n\nModern history (20th–21st centuries)\n\nIn 1973, the city was the site of an anomalous hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\"\n\nIn 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and the Port of Sudan was completed.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination for hundreds of thousands refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums at the outskirts of the city. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict have settled around Khartoum.\n\nIn 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in northern Khartoum. The destruction of the factory produced diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.\n\nThe sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan, John Garang, at the end of July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. The riots finally died down after Southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The situation could have been much more dire; even so, the death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.\n\nThe Organisation of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.\nThe African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum.\n\nThe Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006 was held in Khartoum, during which the Arab League awarded Sudan the Arab League presidency.\n\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group, Justice and Equality Movement, moved into the city, where they engaged in heavy fighting with Sudanese government forces. Their soldiers included minors, and their goal was to topple Omar al-Bashir's government, though the Sudanese government succeeded in beating back the assault.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government has claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGeography \n\nLocation \n\nKhartoum is located in northeast Africa, near the center of Sudan, which measures about one quarter the size of the United States. Its neighbors are Chad and the Central African Republic to the west, Egypt and Libya to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Ethiopia and Eritrea to the east, and South Sudan, to the south. The Red Sea washes about 500 mi of its northeast coast, and it is traversed from south to north by the Nile, all of whose great tributaries are partly or entirely within its borders.\n\nKhartoum is located in the middle of the populated areas in Sudan, at almost the northeast center of the country between 15 and 16 degrees latitude north, and between 31 and 32 degrees longitude east. Khartoum marks the convergence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile, where they join to form the bottom of the leaning-S shape of the main Nile (see map, upper right) as it zigzags through northern Sudan into Egypt at Lake Nasser.\n\nKhartoum is relatively flat, at elevation , as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation  about 101 mi away.\n\n[http://41.223.201.247/videoplayer/khartoum.pdf?ich_u_r_icf31d74b4b47b81ee8ffba0509858218&ich_s_t_a_r_t\n0&ich_e_n_d0&ich_k_e_y\n1345118918751963422431&ich_t_y_p_e1&ich_d_i_s_k_i_d\n4&ich_u_n_i_t=1]\n\nClimate\n\nUnder Köppen's climate classification system, Khartoum features a hot arid climate, with only the summer months seeing noticeable precipitation. The city averages a little over 155 mm of precipitation per year. Based on annual mean temperatures, the city is one of the hottest major cities in the world. Temperatures routinely exceed 40 °C in mid-summer. \n\nIts average annual high temperature is , with six months of the year seeing an average monthly high temperature of at least 38 °C. Furthermore, throughout the year, none of its monthly average high temperatures falls below 30 °C. During the months of January and February, while daytime temperatures are generally very warm, nights are relatively cool, with average low temperatures just above 15 °C. \n\nDemographics\n\nEconomy\n\nAfter the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, Mac Nimir Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.\n\nIn the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the South, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.\n\nAmong the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.\n\nRetailing\n\nThe Souq Al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The \"souq\" is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.\n\nAl Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.\n\nAfra Mall is located in the southern suburb Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.\n\nIn 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\nEducation\n\nKhartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. In Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, there are four main levels of education.\nFirst: kindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3-4, consists of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).\nSecond: elementary school. the first grade pupils enter at the age of 6-7 .and It consists of 8 grades, each year there is more academic efforts and main subjects added plus more school methods improvements. By the 8th grade a student is 13–14 years old ready to take the certificate exams and entering high school.\nThird: upper second school and high school. At this level the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, geography, etc...\nthere are three grades in this level. The students ages are about 14-15 to 17-18.\nHigher Education: there are many universities in Sudan such as the university of Khartoum. Some foreigners attend universities there, as the reputation of the universities are very good and the living expenses are low compared to other countries.\nThe education system in Sudan went through many changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[http://www.mohe.gov.sd/ ][http://www.moe.gov.sd/ ]\n\nHigh schools\n\n* Khartoum Old High Secondary School for Boys\n* Khartoum Old High Secondary School for Girls\n* The British Educational Schools (BES)\n* Khartoum American School, KAS, established in 1957.\n* Khartoum International Community School, KICS, established in 2004.\n* Unity High School.\n* Suliman Hussein Academy\n* Comboni and St. Francis, Khartoum new high secondary school for boys\n* Khartoum International preparatory school (KIPS)|Khartoum International preparatory school, established in 1928.\n* Qabbas Private International Schools\n* Riad English School, established 1987\n* Nile Valley School, founded 2012 http://www.nilevalleyschool.com/whoweare.php\n\nThe higher institutes in Khartoum \n\nTransportation\n\nAir\n\nKhartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport.

There have been delays to start construction because lack of funding of the project but it is expected that the airport will be completed sometime in 2018. It will replace the current airport in Khartoum as Sudan's main airport.\n\nBridges\n\nThe following bridges cross the Blue Nile and connect Khartoum to Khartoum North:\n*Mac Nimir Bridge\n*Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge\n*Elmansheya Bridge\n\nRail\n\nKhartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways. Some lines also extended to some parts of south Sudan\n\nArchitecture \n\nArchitecture of Khartoum cannot be identified by one style or even two styles; it is as diverse as its culture, where 597 different cultural groups meet. In this article are 10 buildings of Khartoum to showcase this diversity in buildings’ shapes, materials, treatments. Sudan was home to numerous ancient civilizations, such as the Kingdom of Kush, Kerma, Nobatia, Alodia, Makuria, Meroë and others, most of which flourished along the Nile. During the pre-dynastic period Nubia and Nagadan Upper Egypt were identical, simultaneously evolved systems of Pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC.\n\nIn response to the worldwide deterioration of the environment and the increase in pollution levels, there has been a strong movement towards sustainable architecture across the globe. This movement has received attention and concern from governments as well as private sectors. In the past decades, Sudan has seen a huge surge in infrastructure and technology, which has led to many new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques. There is now a constant flow of new projects arising, thus leading to a new, transformed, modernised form of architecture.\n\n* Squares and public gardens\n\nMasjids and Places of worship\n\nJami el kebir,Khartum.jpg|The Great Masjid\nالخرطوم-جزيرة توتي.jpg|Masjid Shahid\nFaruq Mosque,Khartum.jpg|Faruq Mosque,Khartum\nSiadah Sanhory mosque in Manshiya.JPG|Siadah Sanhory mosque in Manshiya\nShahid mosque Algomah prayers in Ramadan2.JPG|Shahid mosque Algomah prayers in Ramadan\n\nCulture\n\nMuseums\n\nThe largest museum in all of Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan.
