  "textBody" : "The knock-knock joke is a question-and-answer joke, typically ending with a pun. Knock-knock jokes are primarily seen as children's jokes, though there are exceptions.\n\nThe scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house. The teller of the joke says, \"Knock, knock!\"; the recipient responds, \"Who's there?\" The teller gives a name (such as \"Noah\") or a description (such as \"Police\") or something that purports to be a name (such as \"Needle\"). The other person then responds by asking the caller's surname (\"Noah who?\" \"Police who?\" \"Needle who?\"), to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name (\" place I can spend the night?\" \" let me in—it's cold out here!\" \" help with the groceries!\").\n\nThe formula of the joke must be followed strictly:\n\n::Knock, knock.\n::Who's there?\n::[ Someone or something ]\n::[ Someone or something ] who?\n::[ Punchline ]\n\nIn the United States, children tend to learn this formula in preschool.\n\nAs shown below, knock-knock jokes can take the form of simple puns on the name given (1), jokes specifically involving the door-knocking scenario (2), puns on the \"who?\" phrase of the speaker (3), or humorous departures from the knock-knock joke form (4).\n\nThe following popular children's knock-knock joke demonstrates some latitude of the form:\n\n::Knock, knock.\n::Who's there?\n::Banana.\n::Banana who?\n::Knock, knock.\n::Who's there?\n::Banana.\n::Banana who?\n::Knock, knock.\n::Who's there?\n::Orange.\n::Orange who?\n:: glad I didn't say \"Banana\"?\n\nHistory\n\nA possible source of the joke is William Shakespeare's Macbeth; first performed in 1606. In Act 2, Scene 3 the porter is very hungover from the previous night. During his monologue he uses a variation of the joke as a refrain while he is speaking:\n\n::Knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of\n::Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged\n::himself on the expectation of plenty: come in\n::time; have napkins enow about you; here\n::you'll sweat for't.\n\n::Knock, knock!

Faith, here's an equivocator, that could\n::swear in both the scales against either scale;\n::who committed treason enough for God's sake,\n::yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come\n::in, equivocator.\n\nWriting in the Oakland Tribune, Merely McEvoy recalled a style of joke from around 1900 where a person would ask a question such as \"Do you know Arthur?\", the unsuspecting listener responding with \"Arthur who?\" and the joke teller answering \"Arthurmometer!\"\n\nA variation of the format in the form of a children's game was described in 1929. In the game of Buff, a child with a stick thumps it on the ground, and the dialogue ensues:\n\n::Knock, knock!\n::Who's there?\n::Buff.\n::What says Buff?\n::Buff says Buff to all his men, And I say Buff to you again.\n\nIn 1936, the standard knock-knock joke format was used in a newspaper advertisement.[http://rolfe.advantage-preservation.com/Viewer/?key%22knock%20knock%22&pt\n1563&fnthe_rolfe_arrow_usa_iowa_rolfe_19360910_english_5&page\n1&serppageno=1 \"Hee Haw News\"] p. 4.
