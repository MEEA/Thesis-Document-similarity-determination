  "textBody" : "Abdülhamid I, Abdul Hamid I or Abd Al-Hamid I (, `Abdü’l-Ḥamīd-i evvel; ; 20 March 1725 – 7 April 1789) was the 27th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning over the Ottoman Empire from 1773 to 1789.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born in Constantinople, a younger son of Sultan Ahmed III (reigned 1703–1730) and his consort Şermi Kadın. Ahmed III abdicated in favor of his nephew Mahmud I, who was succeeded by his brother Osman III, and Osman by Ahmed's elder son Mustafa III. As a potential heir to the throne, Abdül Hamid was imprisoned in comfort by his cousins and older brother, as was customary. This lasted until 1767. During this period, he received his early education from his mother Rabia Şermi, who taught him history and calligraphy.\n\nWhen his brother Mustafa III died, Abdül Hamid succeeded him on 21 January 1774.\n\nReign\n\nAbdül Hamid's long imprisonment had left him indifferent to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors. Yet he was also very religious and a pacifist by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the Janissary Corps. The new Sultan told the Janissaries \"There are no longer gratuities in our treasury, as all of our soldier sons should learn.\"\n\nDespite his pacific inclinations, the Ottoman Empire was forced to renew the ongoing war with Russia almost immediately. This led to complete Turkish defeat at Kozludzha and the humiliating Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, signed on 21 July 1774. The Ottomans ceded territory to Russia, and also the right to intervene on behalf of the Orthodox Christians in the Empire.\n\nAbdülhamid now sought to reform the Empire's armed forces. He enumerated the Janissary corps and tried to renovate it, and also the navy. He established a new artillery corps. He was also credited with the creation of the Imperial Naval Engineering School.\n\nAbdülhamid tried to strengthen Ottoman rule over Syria, Egypt, and Iraq. However, slight successes against rebellions in Syria and the Morea could not compensate for the loss of the Crimean Peninsula, which had become nominally independent in 1774, but was in practice now controlled by Russia.\n\nRussia repeatedly exploited its position as protector of Eastern Christians to interfere in the Ottoman Empire, and explicitly. Finally the Ottomans declared war against Russia in 1787. Austria soon joined Russia. Turkey held its own in the conflict, at first, but on 6 December 1788, Ochakov fell to Russia (all of its inhabitants being massacred). It is said that this sad defeat broke Abdül Hamid's spirit, as he died four months later.\n\nIn spite of his failures, Abdülhamid was regarded as the most gracious Ottoman Sultan. He personally directed the fire brigade during the Constantinople fire of 1782. He was admired by the people for his religious devotion, and was even called a Veli (\"saint\"). He also outlined a reform policy, supervised the government closely, and worked with statesmen.\n\nIn 1789, Tipu Sultan, ruler of the Sultanate of Mysore sent an embassy to Abdülhamid, urgently requesting assistance against the British East India Company, and proposed an offensive and defensive alliance. Abdul Hamid informed the Mysori ambassadors that the Ottomans were still entangled and exhausted from the ongoing war with Russia and Austria.\n\nDeath\n\nAbdülhamid died on 7 April 1789, at the age of sixty-four, in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.\n\nHe bred Arabian horses with great passion. One breed of Küheylan Arabians was named \"Küheylan Abdülhamid\" after him.\n\nFamily\n\n;Consorts\nAbdul Hamid had nine wives:\n* Ayşe Kadın (died 1775, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul), the principal consort;\n* Ruhşah Kadın alias El-Hace Hatice (died 1808, buried in Abdul Hamid I Mausoleum, Istanbul), the principal consort;\n* Sineperver Sultan alias Ayşe (died 11 December 1828, buried in Eyüp Sultan Mosque), the second consort;\n* Binnaz Kadın (died June 1823, buried in Abdul Hamid I Mausoleum, Istanbul), the third consort;\n* Mehtabe Kadın (married 13 August 1774), the fourth consort;\n* Mutebere Kadın (married 20 October 1774; died 16 May 1837, buried in Abdul Hamid I Mausoleum, Istanbul), the fifth consort;\n* Hümaşah Kadın (married 1775, died 1778, buried in New Mosque, Istanbul), the sixth consort;\n* Şebsafa Kadın alias Fatma (married 1781, died 1805, buried in Zeyrek Mosque, Eminönü, Istanbul), the sixth consort;\n* Nakşidil Sultan (married 1882, died 17 August 1817, buried in Nakşidil Sultan Mausoleum, Fatih Mosque, Istanbul, the seventh consort.
