  "textBody" : "The transport system of Finland is well-developed. Factors affecting traffic include the sparse population and long distance between towns and cities, and the cold climate with waterways freezing and land covered in snow for winter.\n\nThe extensive road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. , the country's network of main roads has a total length of around 78162 km and all public roads 104161 km. The motorway network totals 779 km with additional 124 km reserved only for motor traffic. Road network expenditure of around 1 billion euro is paid with vehicle and fuel taxes that amount to around 1.5 billion euro and 1 billion euro.\n\nThe main international passenger gateway is Helsinki-Vantaa Airport with over 17 million passengers in 2016. About 25 airports have scheduled passenger services. They are financed by competitive fees and rural airport may be subsidized. The Helsinki-Vantaa based Finnair (known for an Asia-focused strategy), Nordic Regional Airlines provide air services both domestically and internationally. Helsinki has an optimal location for great circle routes between Western Europe and the Far East. Hence, many international travelers visit Helsinki on a stop-over between Asia and Europe.\n\nDespite low population density, taxpayers spend annually around 350 million euro in maintaining 5865 km railway tracks even to many rural towns. Operations are privatized and currently the only operator is the state-owned VR. It has 5 percent passenger market share (out of which 80 percent are urban trips in Greater Helsinki) and 25 percent cargo market share.[http://www.lvm.fi/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService\nlvm/cm/pub/showdoc.p?docid2033&menuid\n119 Transport and communications ministry – Rail]  Helsinki has an urban rail network.\n\nIcebreakers keep the 23 ports open all year round.  There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku, which have ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, Sweden and several other destinations.\n\nRoads \n\nRoad transport in Finland is the most popular method of transportation, particularly in rural areas where the railway network does not extend to.  there are 78162 km of public roads, of which 51016 km are paved. The main road network comprises over 13329 km of road.\n\nHighways\n\n64% of all traffic on public roads takes place on main roads, which are divided into class I (/) and class II (/) main roads. Motorways have been constructed in the country since the 1960s, but they are still reasonably rare because traffic volumes are not large enough to motivate their construction. There are 863 km of motorways. Longest stretches are Helsinki–Turku (Main road 1/E18), Helsinki–Tampere (Main road 3/E12), Helsinki–Heinola (Main road 4/E75), and Helsinki–Hamina (Main road 7/E18). The world's northernmost motorway is also located in Finland between Keminmaa and Tornio (Main road 29/E8).\n\nThere are no toll roads in Finland.[http://www.rhinocarhire.com/Drive-Smart-Blog/Drive-Smart-Finland.aspx Guide to Driving In Finland - Drive Safe in Finland] Rhino Car Hire\n\nSpeed limits\n\nSpeed limits change depending on the time of the year; the maximum speed limit on motorways is 120 km/h in the summer and 100 km/h in the winter. The main roads usually have speed limits of either 100 km/h or 80 km/h. Speed limits in urban areas range between 30 km/h and 60 km/h. If no other speed limit is signposted, the  general speed limit in Finland is  50 km/h in built-up areas and  80 km/h outside.\n\nVehicles\n\n, there are 4,95 million registered automobiles, of which 2,58 million cars. Average age of cars (museum cars excluded) is over ten years, and typically the cars are destroyed in age of 24 years.\n In 2015, ca. 123 000 new vehicles were registered in Finland. About 550,000–600,000 used automobiles are sold each year in Finland. During 2011-2014 the most sold car brand was Volkswagen. It had a market share of 12% of new cars.\n\nPublic transport \n\nCoaches are mainly operated by private companies and provide services widely across the country. There is a large network of ExpressBus services with connections to all major cities and the most important rural areas as well as a burgeoning OnniBus 'cheap bus' network. Coach stations are operated by Matkahuolto.[http://www.expat-finland.com/travel_finland/bus_train.html Long Distance Bus & Train Services in Finland] Expat Finland\n\nLocal bus services inside cities and towns have often  been tightly regulated by the councils. Many councils also have their own bus operators, such as Tampere City Transit (TKL), which operates some bus lines on a commercial basis in competition with privately owned providers. Regional bus lines have been regulated by the provincial administration to protect old transit companies, leading to cartel situations like TLO in the Turku region, but strong regional regulating bodies, like the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL/HRT), whose routes are put out to tender exist as well and will become the norm after the transitional period during the 2010s.\n\nAccidents \n\nIn 2015, number of  road traffic accidents involving personal injury was 5,164. In them, 266 persons were killed. The number of road deaths per million inhabitants is just below the European average. Traffic safety has improved significantly since the early 1970s, when more than one thousand people died in road traffic every year. \n\nParking \n\nMunicipal law 30-31 § gives right to Referendum since year 1990.

In 2010, passengers made 13.4 million long distance voyages and 55.5 million trips in local traffic. On the same year, over 35000000 t of freight were transported.\n\nPassenger trains are operated by the state-owned VR Group. They serve all the major cities and many rural areas, complemented by bus connections where needed. Most passenger train services originate or terminate at Helsinki Central railway station, and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of Helsinki. High-speed Pendolino services are operated from Helsinki to other major cities like Jyväskylä, Joensuu, Kuopio, Oulu, Tampere and Turku.  Modern InterCity services complement the Pendolino network, and cheaper and older long and short distance trains operate in areas with fewer passengers.\n\nThe Helsinki area has three urban rail systems: a tramway, a metro, and a commuter rail system. Light rail systems are currently being planned for Helsinki and also for Turku and Tampere, two of the country's other major urban centres.\n\nTrams and light rail \n\nIn Finland there have been three cities with trams: Helsinki, Turku and Tampere. Only Helsinki has retained its tramway network. The trams in Tampere ceased operations in 1957, while the Turku tramway network shut down in 1972.\n\nIn november 2016, Tampere city council approved the construction of a new light rail system. Construction of phase 1 begun late 2016 and is scheduled to finish in 2021. Turku also has preliminary plans for new tram system, but no decision to build it has been made.\n\nHelsinki currently operates 13 tramlines on a network of approximately 90 km of track in passenger service.  The trams have annually 57 million passengers.\n\nAir transport \n\nThere are 148 airfields, 74 of which have paved runways.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fi.html CIA Factbook Finland] CIA  21 airports are served by scheduled passenger flights. By far the largest airport is Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, and the second largest by passenger volume is Oulu Airport. The larger airports are managed by the state-owned Finavia (formerly the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration). Finnair, Nordic Regional Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle are the main carriers for domestic flights.\n\nHelsinki-Vantaa airport is Finland's global gateway with scheduled non-stop flights to such places as Bangkok, Beijing, Guangzhou, Nagoya, New York, Osaka, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Helsinki has an optimal location for great circle airline traffic routes between Western Europe and the Far East.  The airport is located approximately 19 kilometers north of Helsinki's downtown in the city of Vantaa, thus the name Helsinki-Vantaa.\n\nOther airports with regular scheduled international connections are Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport, Mariehamn Airport, Tampere-Pirkkala Airport, Turku Airport and Vaasa Airport.\n\nWater transport \n\nThe Finnish Maritime Administration is responsible for the maintenance of Finland's waterway network. Finland's waterways includes some 7600 km of coastal fairways and 7900 km of Finland waterways (on rivers, canals, and lakes). Saimaa Canal connects Lake Saimaa, and thus much of the inland waterway  system of Finland, with the Baltic Sea at Vyborg (Viipuri). However, the lower part of the canal is currently located in Russia. To facilitate through shipping, Finland leases the Russian section of the canal from Russia (the original agreement with the Soviet Union dates to 1963).[http://www.gosaimaa.com/en/About-area/Transportation/Transportation?id=b81cd4eb-23d4-4896-862e-9e223abdab4c Saimaa Canal] Go Saimaa\n\nThe largest general port is Port of Hamina-Kotka.
