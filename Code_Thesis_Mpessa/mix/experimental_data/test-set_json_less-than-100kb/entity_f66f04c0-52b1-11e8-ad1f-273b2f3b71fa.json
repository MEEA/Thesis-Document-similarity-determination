  "textBody" : "In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,\n5! 5  \\times  4  \\times  3  \\times  2  \\times  1 \n 120.  \n\nThe value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.Ronald L. Graham, Donald E.

Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.N. L. Biggs, The roots of combinatorics, Historia Math. 6 (1979) 109−136  Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.  The publisher is given as \"W.S.\" who may have been William Smith, possibly acting as agent for the Society of College Youths, to which society the \"Dedicatory\" is addressed.  After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):\n\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;\n\nThe notation n! was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. says Krempe though.\n\nThe definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe factorial function is formally defined by the product\n\n\\begin{align}\nn! & \\prod_{k\n1}^n k \\\\\n   & = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (n-2) \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot n \\\\\n   & = n (n-1)(n-2) \\cdots (2)(1) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\ninitially for integer , and resulting in this fundamental recurrence relation:\n\n (n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n! .\n\nE.g.:\n\\begin{align}5! &= 5 \\cdot 4! \\\\\n 6! &=  6 \\cdot  5! \\\\\n50! &= 50 \\cdot 49! \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n0!\n\nIn order for this recurrence relation to be extended to n=0, it is necessary to define\n\n0! = 1 \n\nso that\n\n1! 1 \\cdot 0! \n 1 \\ .\n\nOther consequences that indicate defining 0! = 1  and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:\n* There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, \"everything\" is left in place).\n* It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is \n:\\tbinom{0}{0} \\tfrac{0!}{0!0!} \n 1 .\nMore generally, the number of ways to choose (all) n elements among a set of n is\n:\\tbinom{n}{n} \\tfrac{n!}{n!0!} \n 1 .\n* It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the exponential function, as a power series:\n:  e^x \\sum_{n \n 0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}.\n\nFactorial of a non-integer\n\nThe factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function  n! = \\Gamma(n+1) ), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.\n\nApplications\n\nAlthough the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.\n* There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.\n* Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of\n:n^{\\underline k}=n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)\npossibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is\n:\\frac{n^{\\underline k}}{k!}=\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots(1)}.\nThis number is known as the binomial coefficient \\tbinom nk, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in .\n* Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.\n* Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula, where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.\n* Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.\n* Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as\n:n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!};\nwhile this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property of binomial coefficients:\n:\\binom nk\\frac{n^{\\underline k}}{k!}\n\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} \\frac{n^{\\underline{n-k}}}{(n-k)!} \n \\binom n{n-k}.\n* The factorial function can be shown, using the power rule, to be\n:\\begin{align}\nn! &= D^n(x^n) \\\\\n   &= \\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^n) \\\\\n\\end{align}\nwhere D^nx^n is the Euler's notation for the nth derivative of x^n .\n\nRate of growth and approximations for large n\n\nAs n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.\n\nMost approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm\n\\ln n! \\sum_{x\n1}^n \\ln x.\n\nThe graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false.\nWe get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:\n\n \\int_1^n \\ln x \\, dx \\leq \\sum_{x=1}^n \\ln x \\leq \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) \\, dx\n\nwhich gives us the estimate\n\n n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)+1 \\leq \\ln n! \\leq (n+1)\\ln\\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right) + 1.\n\nHence \\ln n! \\sim n\\ln n (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that\n\ne\\left(\\frac ne\\right)^n \\leq n! \\leq e\\left(\\frac{n+1}e\\right)^{n+1}.\n\nIt is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have (n/3)^n , and for all n ≥ 6 we have n! .\n\nFor large n we get a better estimate for the number n! using Stirling's approximation:\n\nn!\\sim\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.\n\nThis in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:\n\n\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\n\nAnother approximation for  is given by Srinivasa Ramanujan \n\n\\ln n! \\approx n\\ln n - n + \\frac {\\ln(n(1+4n(1+2n)))}{6} + \\frac {\\ln(\\pi)}{2}\nor\nn!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n[1 +1/(2n) +1/(8n^2)]^{1/6}.\nBoth this and \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^ne^\\frac 1{12n} give a relative error on the order of 1/n3, but Ramanujan's is about four times more accurate. However, if we use two correction terms (as in Ramanujan's approximation) the relative error will be of order 1/n5:\n\nn!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\exp\\left({\\frac 1{12n}-\\frac 1{360n^3}}\\right)\n\nComputation\n\nIf efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.\n\nThe main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however many languages support variable length integer types capable of calculating very large values.https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! 100 ! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.\n\nIf the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications ((1 \\times 2) \\times 3) \\times 4 \\times\\cdots, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.GNU MP software manual, [http://gmplib.org/manual/Factorial-Algorithm.html \"Factorial Algorithm\"] (retrieved 22 January 2013).\n\nThe asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).Peter Borwein. \"On the Complexity of Calculating Factorials\". Journal of Algorithms 6, 376–380 (1985) Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/FastFactorialFunctions.htm Fast-Factorial-Functions: The Homepage of Factorial Algorithms].\n\nNumber theory\n\nFactorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if\n(n-1)!\\ \\equiv\\ 0 \\pmod n.\n\nA stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that\n(p-1)!\\ \\equiv\\ -1 \\pmod p\nif and only if p is prime.\n\nLegendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of n! as\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\left \\lfloor \\frac n {p^i} \\right \\rfloor\nor, equivalently, \n\\frac{n - s_p(n)}{p - 1},\nwhere s_p(n) denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.\n\nAdding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.  Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.\n\nSeries of reciprocals\n\nThe reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!} \n \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24}  + \\frac{1}{120} + \\cdots = e\\,.\nAlthough the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac 1 {(n+2)n!} \n \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{144} + \\cdots=1\\,.\nThe convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial.\nTherefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence..\n\nExtension of factorial to non-integer values of argument\n\nThe Gamma and Pi functions\n\nBesides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that \"fills in\" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by\n\n\\Gamma(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t. \n\nIts relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n\nn!=\\Gamma(n+1).\n\nEuler's original formula for the Gamma function was\n\n\\Gamma(z)\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n^zn!}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{k\n0}^n (z+k)}. \n\nAn alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used.  The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by\n\n\\Pi(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^z e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t\\,.\n\nIn terms of the Gamma function it is\n\n\\Pi(z) = \\Gamma(z+1) \\,.\n\nIt truly extends the factorial in that\n\n\\Pi(n) = n! \\text{ for } n \\in \\mathbf{N}\\, .\n\nIn addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined\n\n\\Pi(z) = z\\Pi(z-1)\\,.\n\nIn fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation.\nExpressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form\n\n\\Gamma(n+1)=n\\Gamma(n)\\,.\n\nSince the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:\n\nz! = \\Pi(z)\n\nThe values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has\n\n\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}\\right )\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right )!\n\\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) = \\sqrt{\\pi},\n\nfrom which it follows that for n ∈ N,\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right )! \n \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) \\\\[5pt]\n{} & \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k\n1}^n {2k - 1 \\over 2} {(2n)! \\over 4^n n!} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {(2n-1)! \\over 2^{2n-1}(n-1)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.\n\\end{align}\n\nFor example,\n\\Gamma(4.5) 3.5! \n \\Pi(3.5) {1\\over 2}\\cdot{3\\over 2}\\cdot{5\\over 2} \\cdot {7\\over 2} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {8! \\over 4^4 4!} \\sqrt{\\pi} {7! \\over 2^7 3!} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {105 \\over 16} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 11.63.\n\nIt also follows that for n ∈ N,\n\n\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right )! \n \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k\n1}^n {2 \\over 1 - 2k} = {(-4)^n n! \\over (2n)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.\n\nFor example,\n\\Gamma(-2.5) (-3.5)! \n \\Pi(-3.5) {2\\over -1}\\cdot{2\\over -3}\\cdot{2\\over -5} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {(-4)^3 3! \\over 6!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = -{8 \\over 15} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx -0.9453.\n\nThe Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1)  nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) \n nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.\n\nHowever, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.  For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function  which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/hadamard/HadamardsGammaFunction.html Hadamard versus Euler – Who found the better Gamma function?].\n\nEuler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:\n\n\\begin{align}n! \\Pi(n) &\n \\prod_{k 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{k+1}{k}\\right)^n\\!\\!\\frac{k}{n+k} \\\\ &\n \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)^n\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^n\\frac{2}{n+2}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^n\\frac{3}{n+3}\\right]\\cdots. \\end{align}\n\nHowever, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.\n\nApplications of the Gamma function\n\nThe volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere of radius R is\n\nV_n=\\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma((n/2)+1)}R^n.\n\nFactorial at the complex plane\n\nRepresentation through the Gamma-function allows evaluation of factorial of complex argument. Equilines of amplitude and phase of factorial are shown in figure. Let \\ f\\rho \\exp({\\rm i}\\varphi)\n(x+{\\rm i}y)!\\Gamma(x+{\\rm i}y+1) . Several levels of constant modulus (amplitude) \\rho \n\\rm const and constant phase \\varphi=\\rm const are shown. The grid covers range\n~-3 \\le x \\le 3~,\n~-2 \\le y \\le 2~\nwith unit step. The scratched line shows the level \\varphi=\\pm \\pi.\n\nThin lines show intermediate levels of constant modulus and constant phase. At poles  x+ {\\rm i}y \\in \\rm (negative ~ integers), phase and amplitude are not defined. Equilines are dense in vicinity of singularities along negative integer values of the argument.\n\nFor |z|, the Taylor expansions can be used:\nz!\\sum_{n\n0}^\\infty g_n z^n.\nThe first coefficients of this expansion are\n\nwhere \\gamma is the Euler constant and \\zeta is the Riemann zeta function. Computer algebra systems such as SageMath can generate many terms of this expansion.\n\nApproximations of factorial\n\nFor the large values of the argument,\nfactorial can be approximated through the integral of the\ndigamma function, using the continued fraction representation.\nThis approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is\n P(z) = p(z) + \\log(2\\pi)/2 - z + \\left(z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\log(z),\nStieltjes gave a continued fraction for p(z)\n\np(z)=\\cfrac{a_0}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_1}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_2}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_3}{z+\\ddots}}}}\n\nThe first few coefficients an areDigital Library of Mathematical Functions, http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.10\n\nThere is a misconception that \\displaystyle\\log(z!)P(z) or \\log(\\Gamma(z\\!+\\!1))\nP(z)\nfor any complex z ≠ 0. Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while |\\Im(\\Gamma(z\\!+\\!1))| . The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part.  However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis. (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities).  While |\\Im(z)| >2  or \\Re(z)>2, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/approx/continuedfraction.html On Stieltjes' Continued Fraction for the Gamma Function.].\n\nNon-extendability to negative integers\n\nThe relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer.  The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:\n\n(n-1)! = \\frac{n!}{n} .\n\nNote, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer.  (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)\n\nFactorial-like products and functions\n\nThere are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:\n\nDouble factorial \n\nThe product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.. That is,\n(2k-1)!! \\prod_{i\n1}^k (2i-1) \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!} \n \\frac {_{2k}P_k} {2^k} = \\frac  {2^k}.\nFor example, 9!!  1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 \n 945.\n\nThe sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...  starts as\n1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... \n\nDouble factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals, to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,. and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs..\n\nMultifactorials\n\nA common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (n!!), three (n!!!), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (n!!!) and so on.   One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by n!^{(k)}, recursively for positive integers as\n n!^{(k)} = \\begin{cases}\nn & \\text{if } 0  k\n\\end{cases}\nthough see the alternative definition below.\nIn addition, similarly to , one can define:\n n!^{(k)} = 1 \\ \\text{if } -k \n\nFor sufficiently large n \\geq 1, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\nn! & = n!! \\cdot (n-1)!!,\\ n \\geq 1 \\\\ \n   & = n!!! \\cdot (n-1)!!! \\cdot (n-2)!!!,\\ n \\geq 2 \\\\ \n   & \\prod_{i\n0}^{k-1} (n-i)!^{(k)},\\ \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}, n \\geq k-1. \n\\end{align}\n\nSome mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of n!_2 for the double factorial and similarly n!_k for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the k parameter as a subscript as n!_{(k)} to denote the multifactorials defined above.\n\nIn the same way that n! is not defined for negative integers, and n!! is not defined for negative even integers, n!^{(k)} is not defined for negative integers divisible by k.\n\nPrimorial\n\nThe primorial  is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.\n\nSuperfactorial\n\nNeil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first n factorials.  So the superfactorial of 4 is\n\n \\operatorname{sf}(4)1! \\times 2! \\times 3! \\times 4!\n288. \n\nIn general\n\n  \\operatorname{sf}(n)\n  \\prod_{k\n1}^n k! \\prod_{k\n1}^n k^{n-k+1}\n  =1^n\\cdot2^{n-1}\\cdot3^{n-2}\\cdots(n-1)^2\\cdot n^1.\n \n\nEquivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula\n\n  \\operatorname{sf}(n)\n  =\\prod_{0 \\le i \nwhich is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.\n\nThe sequence of superfactorials starts (from n = 0) as\n\n1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... \n\nAlternative definition\n\nClifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial\nn\\$\\equiv \\begin{matrix} \\underbrace{ n!^}}.\nHere, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left:\na^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}.\n\nHyperfactorial\n\nOccasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by\n\n  H(n)\n  \\prod_{k\n1}^n k^k\n  =1^1\\cdot2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdots(n-1)^{n-1}\\cdot n^n.\n \n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... .\n\nThe asymptotic growth rate is\n\nH(n) \\sim A n^{(6n^2 + 6n + 1)/12} e^{-n^2/4}\n\nwhere A 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant. H(14) \n 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.\n\nThe hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.",

The publisher is given as \"W.S.\" who may have been William Smith, possibly acting as agent for the Society of College Youths, to which society the \"Dedicatory\" is addressed.  After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):\n\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;\n\nThe notation n! was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. says Krempe though.\n\nThe definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe factorial function is formally defined by the product\n\n\\begin{align}\nn! & \\prod_{k\n1}^n k \\\\\n   & = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (n-2) \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot n \\\\\n   & = n (n-1)(n-2) \\cdots (2)(1) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\ninitially for integer , and resulting in this fundamental recurrence relation:\n\n (n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n! .\n\nE.g.:\n\\begin{align}5! &= 5 \\cdot 4! \\\\\n 6! &=  6 \\cdot  5! \\\\\n50! &= 50 \\cdot 49! \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n0!\n\nIn order for this recurrence relation to be extended to n=0, it is necessary to define\n\n0! = 1 \n\nso that\n\n1! 1 \\cdot 0! \n 1 \\ .\n\nOther consequences that indicate defining 0! = 1  and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:\n* There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, \"everything\" is left in place).\n* It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is \n:\\tbinom{0}{0} \\tfrac{0!}{0!0!} \n 1 .\nMore generally, the number of ways to choose (all) n elements among a set of n is\n:\\tbinom{n}{n} \\tfrac{n!}{n!0!} \n 1 .\n* It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the exponential function, as a power series:\n:  e^x \\sum_{n \n 0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}.\n\nFactorial of a non-integer\n\nThe factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function  n! = \\Gamma(n+1) ), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.\n\nApplications\n\nAlthough the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.\n* There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.\n* Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of\n:n^{\\underline k}=n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)\npossibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is\n:\\frac{n^{\\underline k}}{k!}=\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\cdots(1)}.\nThis number is known as the binomial coefficient \\tbinom nk, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in .\n* Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.\n* Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula, where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.\n* Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.\n* Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as\n:n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!};\nwhile this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property of binomial coefficients:\n:\\binom nk\\frac{n^{\\underline k}}{k!}\n\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} \\frac{n^{\\underline{n-k}}}{(n-k)!} \n \\binom n{n-k}.\n* The factorial function can be shown, using the power rule, to be\n:\\begin{align}\nn! &= D^n(x^n) \\\\\n   &= \\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^n) \\\\\n\\end{align}\nwhere D^nx^n is the Euler's notation for the nth derivative of x^n .\n\nRate of growth and approximations for large n\n\nAs n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.\n\nMost approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm\n\\ln n! \\sum_{x\n1}^n \\ln x.\n\nThe graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false.\nWe get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:\n\n \\int_1^n \\ln x \\, dx \\leq \\sum_{x=1}^n \\ln x \\leq \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) \\, dx\n\nwhich gives us the estimate\n\n n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)+1 \\leq \\ln n! \\leq (n+1)\\ln\\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right) + 1.\n\nHence \\ln n! \\sim n\\ln n (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that\n\ne\\left(\\frac ne\\right)^n \\leq n! \\leq e\\left(\\frac{n+1}e\\right)^{n+1}.\n\nIt is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have (n/3)^n , and for all n ≥ 6 we have n! .\n\nFor large n we get a better estimate for the number n! using Stirling's approximation:\n\nn!\\sim\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.\n\nThis in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:\n\n\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\n\nAnother approximation for  is given by Srinivasa Ramanujan \n\n\\ln n! \\approx n\\ln n - n + \\frac {\\ln(n(1+4n(1+2n)))}{6} + \\frac {\\ln(\\pi)}{2}\nor\nn!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n[1 +1/(2n) +1/(8n^2)]^{1/6}.\nBoth this and \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^ne^\\frac 1{12n} give a relative error on the order of 1/n3, but Ramanujan's is about four times more accurate. However, if we use two correction terms (as in Ramanujan's approximation) the relative error will be of order 1/n5:\n\nn!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\exp\\left({\\frac 1{12n}-\\frac 1{360n^3}}\\right)\n\nComputation\n\nIf efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.\n\nThe main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however many languages support variable length integer types capable of calculating very large values.https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! 100 ! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.\n\nIf the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications ((1 \\times 2) \\times 3) \\times 4 \\times\\cdots, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.GNU MP software manual, [http://gmplib.org/manual/Factorial-Algorithm.html \"Factorial Algorithm\"] (retrieved 22 January 2013).\n\nThe asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).Peter Borwein. \"On the Complexity of Calculating Factorials\". Journal of Algorithms 6, 376–380 (1985) Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/FastFactorialFunctions.htm Fast-Factorial-Functions: The Homepage of Factorial Algorithms].\n\nNumber theory\n\nFactorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if\n(n-1)!\\ \\equiv\\ 0 \\pmod n.\n\nA stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that\n(p-1)!\\ \\equiv\\ -1 \\pmod p\nif and only if p is prime.\n\nLegendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of n! as\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\left \\lfloor \\frac n {p^i} \\right \\rfloor\nor, equivalently, \n\\frac{n - s_p(n)}{p - 1},\nwhere s_p(n) denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.\n\nAdding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.  Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.\n\nSeries of reciprocals\n\nThe reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!} \n \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24}  + \\frac{1}{120} + \\cdots = e\\,.\nAlthough the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:\n\\sum_{n0}^\\infty \\frac 1 {(n+2)n!} \n \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{144} + \\cdots=1\\,.\nThe convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial.\nTherefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence..\n\nExtension of factorial to non-integer values of argument\n\nThe Gamma and Pi functions\n\nBesides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that \"fills in\" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by\n\n\\Gamma(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t. \n\nIts relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n\nn!=\\Gamma(n+1).\n\nEuler's original formula for the Gamma function was\n\n\\Gamma(z)\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n^zn!}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{k\n0}^n (z+k)}. \n\nAn alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used.  The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by\n\n\\Pi(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^z e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t\\,.\n\nIn terms of the Gamma function it is\n\n\\Pi(z) = \\Gamma(z+1) \\,.\n\nIt truly extends the factorial in that\n\n\\Pi(n) = n! \\text{ for } n \\in \\mathbf{N}\\, .\n\nIn addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined\n\n\\Pi(z) = z\\Pi(z-1)\\,.\n\nIn fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation.\nExpressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form\n\n\\Gamma(n+1)=n\\Gamma(n)\\,.\n\nSince the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:\n\nz! = \\Pi(z)\n\nThe values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has\n\n\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}\\right )\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right )!\n\\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) = \\sqrt{\\pi},\n\nfrom which it follows that for n ∈ N,\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right )! \n \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) \\\\[5pt]\n{} & \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k\n1}^n {2k - 1 \\over 2} {(2n)! \\over 4^n n!} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {(2n-1)! \\over 2^{2n-1}(n-1)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.\n\\end{align}\n\nFor example,\n\\Gamma(4.5) 3.5! \n \\Pi(3.5) {1\\over 2}\\cdot{3\\over 2}\\cdot{5\\over 2} \\cdot {7\\over 2} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {8! \\over 4^4 4!} \\sqrt{\\pi} {7! \\over 2^7 3!} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {105 \\over 16} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 11.63.\n\nIt also follows that for n ∈ N,\n\n\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right )! \n \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k\n1}^n {2 \\over 1 - 2k} = {(-4)^n n! \\over (2n)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.\n\nFor example,\n\\Gamma(-2.5) (-3.5)! \n \\Pi(-3.5) {2\\over -1}\\cdot{2\\over -3}\\cdot{2\\over -5} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n {(-4)^3 3! \\over 6!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = -{8 \\over 15} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx -0.9453.\n\nThe Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1)  nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) \n nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.\n\nHowever, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.  For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function  which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/hadamard/HadamardsGammaFunction.html Hadamard versus Euler – Who found the better Gamma function?].\n\nEuler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:\n\n\\begin{align}n! \\Pi(n) &\n \\prod_{k 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{k+1}{k}\\right)^n\\!\\!\\frac{k}{n+k} \\\\ &\n \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)^n\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^n\\frac{2}{n+2}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^n\\frac{3}{n+3}\\right]\\cdots. \\end{align}\n\nHowever, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.\n\nApplications of the Gamma function\n\nThe volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere of radius R is\n\nV_n=\\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma((n/2)+1)}R^n.\n\nFactorial at the complex plane\n\nRepresentation through the Gamma-function allows evaluation of factorial of complex argument. Equilines of amplitude and phase of factorial are shown in figure. Let \\ f\\rho \\exp({\\rm i}\\varphi)\n(x+{\\rm i}y)!\\Gamma(x+{\\rm i}y+1) . Several levels of constant modulus (amplitude) \\rho \n\\rm const and constant phase \\varphi=\\rm const are shown. The grid covers range\n~-3 \\le x \\le 3~,\n~-2 \\le y \\le 2~\nwith unit step. The scratched line shows the level \\varphi=\\pm \\pi.\n\nThin lines show intermediate levels of constant modulus and constant phase. At poles  x+ {\\rm i}y \\in \\rm (negative ~ integers), phase and amplitude are not defined. Equilines are dense in vicinity of singularities along negative integer values of the argument.\n\nFor |z|, the Taylor expansions can be used:\nz!\\sum_{n\n0}^\\infty g_n z^n.\nThe first coefficients of this expansion are\n\nwhere \\gamma is the Euler constant and \\zeta is the Riemann zeta function. Computer algebra systems such as SageMath can generate many terms of this expansion.\n\nApproximations of factorial\n\nFor the large values of the argument,\nfactorial can be approximated through the integral of the\ndigamma function, using the continued fraction representation.\nThis approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is\n P(z) = p(z) + \\log(2\\pi)/2 - z + \\left(z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\log(z),\nStieltjes gave a continued fraction for p(z)\n\np(z)=\\cfrac{a_0}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_1}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_2}{z+\n\\cfrac{a_3}{z+\\ddots}}}}\n\nThe first few coefficients an areDigital Library of Mathematical Functions, http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.10\n\nThere is a misconception that \\displaystyle\\log(z!)P(z) or \\log(\\Gamma(z\\!+\\!1))\nP(z)\nfor any complex z ≠ 0. Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while |\\Im(\\Gamma(z\\!+\\!1))| . The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part.  However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis. (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities).  While |\\Im(z)| >2  or \\Re(z)>2, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/approx/continuedfraction.html On Stieltjes' Continued Fraction for the Gamma Function.].\n\nNon-extendability to negative integers\n\nThe relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer.  The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:\n\n(n-1)! = \\frac{n!}{n} .\n\nNote, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer.  (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)\n\nFactorial-like products and functions\n\nThere are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:\n\nDouble factorial \n\nThe product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.. That is,\n(2k-1)!! \\prod_{i\n1}^k (2i-1) \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!} \n \\frac {_{2k}P_k} {2^k} = \\frac  {2^k}.\nFor example, 9!!  1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 \n 945.\n\nThe sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...  starts as\n1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... \n\nDouble factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals, to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,. and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs..\n\nMultifactorials\n\nA common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (n!!), three (n!!!), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (n!!!) and so on.   One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by n!^{(k)}, recursively for positive integers as\n n!^{(k)} = \\begin{cases}\nn & \\text{if } 0  k\n\\end{cases}\nthough see the alternative definition below.\nIn addition, similarly to , one can define:\n n!^{(k)} = 1 \\ \\text{if } -k \n\nFor sufficiently large n \\geq 1, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\nn! & = n!! \\cdot (n-1)!!,\\ n \\geq 1 \\\\ \n   & = n!!! \\cdot (n-1)!!! \\cdot (n-2)!!!,\\ n \\geq 2 \\\\ \n   & \\prod_{i\n0}^{k-1} (n-i)!^{(k)},\\ \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}, n \\geq k-1. \n\\end{align}\n\nSome mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of n!_2 for the double factorial and similarly n!_k for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the k parameter as a subscript as n!_{(k)} to denote the multifactorials defined above.\n\nIn the same way that n! is not defined for negative integers, and n!! is not defined for negative even integers, n!^{(k)} is not defined for negative integers divisible by k.\n\nPrimorial\n\nThe primorial  is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.\n\nSuperfactorial\n\nNeil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first n factorials.  So the superfactorial of 4 is\n\n \\operatorname{sf}(4)1! \\times 2! \\times 3! \\times 4!\n288. \n\nIn general\n\n  \\operatorname{sf}(n)\n  \\prod_{k\n1}^n k! \\prod_{k\n1}^n k^{n-k+1}\n  =1^n\\cdot2^{n-1}\\cdot3^{n-2}\\cdots(n-1)^2\\cdot n^1.\n \n\nEquivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula\n\n  \\operatorname{sf}(n)\n  =\\prod_{0 \\le i \nwhich is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.\n\nThe sequence of superfactorials starts (from n = 0) as\n\n1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... \n\nAlternative definition\n\nClifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial\nn\\$\\equiv \\begin{matrix} \\underbrace{ n!^}}.\nHere, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left:\na^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}.\n\nHyperfactorial\n\nOccasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by\n\n  H(n)\n  \\prod_{k\n1}^n k^k\n  =1^1\\cdot2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdots(n-1)^{n-1}\\cdot n^n.\n \n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... .\n\nThe asymptotic growth rate is\n\nH(n) \\sim A n^{(6n^2 + 6n + 1)/12} e^{-n^2/4}\n\nwhere A 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant. H(14) \n 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.\n\nThe hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function. Factorial. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=10606."
