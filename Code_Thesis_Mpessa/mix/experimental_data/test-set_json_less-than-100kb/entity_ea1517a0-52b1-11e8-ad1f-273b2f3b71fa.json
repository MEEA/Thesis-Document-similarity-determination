  "textBody" : "BIND, or named, is the most widely used Domain Name System (DNS) software on the Internet.\nOn Unix-like operating systems it is the de facto standard.\n\nThe software was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of Berkeley Internet Name Domain, reflecting the application's use within UCB. The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called named, a contracted form of name daemon. In addition the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000.\n\nStarting in 2009, the Internet Software Consortium (ISC) developed a new software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed Bundy to terminate ISC involvement in the project.\n\nDatabase support\n\nWhile earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve zone data in anything other than flat text files, in 2007 BIND 9.4 [http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/ DLZ] provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including LDAP, Berkeley DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ODBC.\n\nBIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity issues that are discovered in BIND 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software.  A complete list of security defects that have been discovered and disclosed in BIND9 is maintained by Internet Systems Consortium, the current authors of the software.\n\nThe BIND 4 and BIND 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities. Use of these ancient versions, or any un-maintained, non-supported version is strongly discouraged.P. Hudson, A. Hudson, B. Ball, H. Duff: Red Hat Fedora 4 Unleashed, page 723. Sams Publishing, 2005  BIND 9 was a complete rewrite, in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues. The [https://www.isc.org/downloads/ downloads page on the ISC web site] clearly shows which versions are currently maintained and which are end of life.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally written by four graduate students at the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), BIND was first released with Berkeley Software Distribution 4.3BSD. Paul Vixie started maintaining it in 1988 while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. , the Internet Systems Consortium maintains, updates, and writes new versions of BIND.\n\nBIND was written by Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou in the early 1980s at the University of California, Berkeley as a result of a DARPA grant. The acronym BIND is for Berkeley Internet Name Domain, from a technical paper published in 1984.\n\nVersions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Paul Vixie of DEC took over BIND development, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1. Paul Vixie continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC.  BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises.  Vixie eventually founded the ISC, which became the entity responsible for BIND versions starting with 4.9.3.\n\nBIND 8 was released by ISC in May 1997.\n\nVersion 9 was developed by Nominum, Inc. under an ISC outsourcing contract, and the first version was released October 9, 2000. It was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with auditing the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). Other important features of BIND 9 include: TSIG, nsupdate, IPv6, rndc (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, and an improved portability architecture.  rndc uses a shared secret to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session. The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft's DNS offerings; the DNSSEC features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important.  BIND 9 was released in September 2000.\n\nIn 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP server components.  In April 2014, with the BIND10 release 1.2.0 the ISC concluded its development work of the project and renamed the project Bundy, moving the source code repository to GitHub for further development by outside public efforts. Bundy is community-supported at the web site http://bundy-dns.de/. ISC discontinued its involvement in the project due to cost-cutting measures. The development of DHCP components was split off to become a new  Kea project.",
