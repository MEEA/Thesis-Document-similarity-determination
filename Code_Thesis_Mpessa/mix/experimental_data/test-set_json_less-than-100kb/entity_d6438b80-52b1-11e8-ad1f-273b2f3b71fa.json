Since the last railway was dismantled in 1952, the only remaining modes of transport are by road, by sea, and by air.\n\nRoads \n\nOf the 12,118 km of roads in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus in 2006, 7,850 km were paved, while 4,268 km were unpaved. In 1996, the Turkish Cypriot area showed a close, but smaller ratio of paved to unpaved with about 1,370 km out of 2,350 km paved and 980 km unpaved.[http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/PWD/pwd.nsf/All/0A49EACB1E1CA73FC2257354003B6922?Opendocument Τμήμα Δημοσίων Έργων - Στατιστικά Στοιχεία - Συντήρηση Δρόμων 2006] As a legacy of British rule, Cyprus is one of only four EU nations in which vehicles drive on the left.\n\nMotorways\n\n* A1 Nicosia to Limassol\n* A2 connects A1 near Pera Chorio with A3 by Larnaca\n* A3 Larnaca Airport to Agia Napa, also serves as a circular road for Larnaca.\n* A5 connects A1 near Kofinou with A3 by Larnaca\n* A6 Pafos to Limassol\n* A7 Pafos to Polis (final plans)\n* A9 Nicosia to Astromeritis (partially under construction)\n* A22 Dali industrial area to Anthoupolis, Lakatamia (Nicosia 3rd ring road, final plans)\n\nPublic buses\n\nIn 2006 extensive plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the European Union Development Bank.

Thus, private car ownership in the country is the fifth highest per capita in the world.

Major harbours of the island are Limassol harbour, and Larnaca harbour, which service cargo, passenger, and cruise ships. Limassol is the larger of the two, and handles a large volume of both cargo and cruise vessels. Larnaca is primarily a cargo port but played a big part in the evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon in 2006, and in the subsequent humanitarian aid effort. A smaller cargo dock also exists at Vasilikos, near Zygi (a small town between Larnaca and Limassol). Smaller vessels and private yachts can dock at Marinas in Cyprus.\n\nLarnaca Marina in Larnaca \n\nSt Raphael Marina in Limassol \n\nPaphos harbour \n\nList of ports and harbours: Larnaca, Limassol, Paphos, Vasilikos.\n\nPublic Bicycle sharing system\n\nBike in Action is the latest transportation system for the greater Nicosia area, similar to programs employed successfully in various cities around the world (Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Melbourne, etc.).
