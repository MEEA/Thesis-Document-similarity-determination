  "textBody" : "My Fair Lady is a musical based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe.  The story concerns Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phoneticist, so that she may pass as a lady. The original Broadway and London shows starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.\n\nThe musical's 1956 Broadway production was a notable critical and popular success. It set a record for the longest run of any show on Broadway up to that time. It was followed by a hit London production, a popular film version, chart topping original cast and soundtrack albums and numerous revivals.  My Fair Lady has frequently been called \"the perfect musical\".See, e.g., Steyn, Mark. Broadway Babies Say Goodnight: Musicals Then and Now, Routledge (1999), p. 119  and [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r1&res\n9F0CEFDA143BF933A25751C1A965958260&oref=slogin this 1993 NY Times review]\n\nPlot\n\n;Act I\nOn a rainy night in Edwardian London, opera patrons are waiting under the arches of Covent Garden for cabs. Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl, runs into a young man called Freddy.  She admonishes him for spilling her bunches of violets in the mud, but she cheers up after selling one to an older gentleman. She then flies into an angry outburst when a man copying down her speech is pointed out to her. The man explains that he studies phonetics and can identify anyone's origin by their accent. He laments Eliza's dreadful speech, asking why so many English people don't speak properly and explaining his theory that this is what truly separates social classes, rather than looks or money (\"Why Can't the English?\"). He declares that in six months he could turn Eliza into a lady by teaching her to speak properly. The older gentleman introduces himself as Colonel Pickering, a linguist who has studied Indian dialects. The phoneticist introduces himself as Henry Higgins, and, as they both have always wanted to meet each other, Higgins invites Pickering to stay at his home in London. He distractedly throws his change into Eliza's basket, and she and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable, proper life (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\").\n\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, and his drinking companions, Harry and Jamie, all dustmen, stop by the next morning.  He is searching for money for a drink, and Eliza shares her profits with him (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\").  Pickering and Higgins are discussing vowels at Higgins's home when Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, informs Higgins that a young woman with a ghastly accent has come to see him.  It is Eliza, who has come to take speech lessons so she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop.  Pickering wagers that Higgins cannot make good on his claim and volunteers to pay for Eliza's lessons.  An intensive makeover of Eliza's speech, manners and dress begins in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball.  Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted, patient man who cannot get along with women (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"). To others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic.\n\nAlfred Doolittle is informed that his daughter has been taken in by Professor Higgins, and considers that he might be able to make a little money from the situation (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\" [Reprise]).\n\nDoolittle arrives at Higgins's house the next morning, claiming that Higgins is compromising Eliza's virtue.  Higgins is impressed by the man's natural gift for language and brazen lack of moral values. He and Doolittle agree that Eliza can continue to take lessons and live at Higgins's house if Higgins gives Doolittle five pounds for a spree.  Higgins flippantly recommends Doolittle to an American millionaire who has written to Higgins seeking a lecturer on moral values.  Meanwhile, Eliza endures speech tutoring, endlessly repeating phrases like \"In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen‚Äù (initially, the only \"h\" she aspirates is in \"hever\") and \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" (to practice the \"long a\" phoneme).  Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill Higgins, from sickness to drowning to a firing squad (\"Just You Wait\").  The servants lament the hard \"work\" Higgins does (\"The Servants' Chorus\").  Just as they give up, Eliza suddenly recites \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" in perfect upper-class style.  Higgins, Eliza, and Pickering happily dance around Higgins's study (\"The Rain in Spain\"). Thereafter she speaks with impeccable received pronunciation. Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed; she declares she is too excited to sleep (\"I Could Have Danced All Night\").\n\nFor her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse (\"Ascot Gavotte\").  Henry's mother reluctantly agrees to help Eliza make conversation, following Henry's advice that Eliza should stick to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.  Eliza makes a good impression at first with her polite manners but later shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to Cockney slang.  She does, however, capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, the young man she ran into in the opening scene.  Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, but she refuses to see him.  He declares that he will wait for her as long as necessary in the street outside Higgins's house (\"On the Street Where You Live\").\n\nEliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball, and after weeks of preparation, she is ready.  All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with her son, the prince (\"Embassy Waltz\"). Eliza then dances with Higgins. A rival and former student of Higgins, a Hungarian phonetician named Zoltan Karpathy, is employed by the hostess to discover Eliza's origins through her speech. Though Pickering and his mother caution him not to, Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.\n\n;Act II\nThe event is revealed to have been a success, with Zoltan Karpathy having concluded that Eliza is \"not only Hungarian, but of royal blood. She is a princess!\"  After the ball, Pickering flatters Higgins on his triumph, and Higgins expresses his pleasure that the experiment is now over (\"You Did It\"). The episode leaves Eliza feeling used and abandoned.  Higgins completely ignores Eliza until he mislays his slippers.  He asks her where they are, and she lashes out at him, leaving the clueless professor mystified by her ingratitude. When Eliza decides to leave Higgins, he insults her in frustration and storms off. Eliza cries as she prepares to leave (\"Just You Wait\" [Reprise]). She finds Freddy still waiting outside (\"On the Street Where You Live\" [Reprise]).  He begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she cuts him off, telling him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (\"Show Me\").  She and Freddy return to Covent Garden, where her friends do not recognize her with her newly refined bearing (\"The Flower Market/Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\" [Reprise]).  By chance, her father is there as well, dressed in a fine suit.  He explains that he received a surprise bequest of four thousand pounds a year from the American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry Eliza's \"stepmother\", the woman he has been living with for many years.  Eliza sees that she no longer belongs in Covent Garden, and she and Freddy depart.  Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (\"Get Me to the Church on Time\").\n\nHiggins awakens the next morning to find that, without Eliza, he has tea instead of coffee, and cannot find his own files.  He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (\"A Hymn to Him\"). Pickering, becoming annoyed with Higgins, leaves to stay with his friend at the Home Office. Higgins seeks his mother's advice and finds Eliza having tea with her.  Higgins's mother leaves Higgins and Eliza together. Eliza explains that Higgins has always treated her as a flower girl, but she learned to be a lady because Pickering treated her as one.  Higgins claims he treated her the same way that Pickering did because both Higgins and Pickering treat all women alike.  Eliza accuses him of wanting her only to fetch and carry for him, saying that she will marry Freddy because he loves her.  She declares she no longer needs Higgins, saying she was foolish to think she did (\"Without You\").  Higgins is struck by Eliza's spirit and independence and wants her to stay with him, but she tells him that he will not see her again.\n\nAs Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\"). He cannot bring himself to confess that he loves her, and insists to himself that if she marries Freddy and then comes back to him, he will not accept her. But he finds it difficult to imagine being alone again.  He reviews the recording he made of the morning Eliza first came to him for lessons.  He hears his own harsh words: \"She's so deliciously low! So horribly dirty!\"  Then the phonograph turns off, and a real voice speaks in a Cockney accent: \"I washed me face an' 'ands before I come, I did\".  It is Eliza, standing in the doorway, tentatively returning to him.  The musical ends on an ambiguous moment of possible reconciliation between teacher and pupil, as Higgins slouches and asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"\n\nCharacters and original Broadway cast\n\nThe original cast of the Broadway stage production:[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/my_fair_lady.htm \"'My Fair Lady' Synopsis, Cast, Scenes and Settings and Musical Numbers\"] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed December 7, 2011.\n\n* Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics ‚Äì Rex Harrison\n* Eliza Doolittle, a young Cockney flowerseller ‚Äì Julie Andrews \n* Alfred P.

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with The Chocolate Soldier, a Viennese operetta based on his play Arms and the Man, refused permission for Pygmalion to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist Alan Jay Lerner to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner Frederick Loewe began work.  They quickly realized, however, that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble.Lerner, p. 36.  Many people, including Oscar Hammerstein II, who, with Richard Rodgers, had also tried his hand at adapting Pygmalion into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.Lerner, p. 38.\n\nDuring this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize Li'l Abner when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about Pygmalion again.Lerner, p. 39.  When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All the insurmountable obstacles that stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realized that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\".Lerner, pp. 43‚Äì44. They then excitedly began writing the show.  However, Chase Manhattan Bank was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to Pygmalion were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe said, \"We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.\"Lerner, p. 47. For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions. The bank, in the end, granted them the musical rights.\n\nLerner settled on the title My Fair Lady, relating both to one of Shaw's provisional titles for Pygmalion, Fair Eliza, and to the final line of every verse of the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\".  Recalling that the Gershwins' 1925 musical Tell Me More had been titled My Fair Lady in its out-of-town tryout, and also had a musical number under that title, Lerner made a courtesy call to Ira Gershwin, alerting him to the use of the title for the Lerner and Loewe musical.\n\nNo√´l Coward was the first to be offered the role of Henry Higgins, but turned it down, suggesting the producers cast Rex Harrison instead.Morley, Sheridan.  A Talent to Amuse: A Biography of No√´l Coward, p. 369, Doubleday & Company, 1969. After much deliberation, Harrison agreed to accept the part. Mary Martin was an early choice for the role of Eliza Doolittle, but declined the role.[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/cvvpw/gallery/martin1.html \"Extravagant Crowd: Mary Martin\"], Beinecke Library, Yale University, accessed December 9, 2011. Young actress Julie Andrews was \"discovered\" and cast as Eliza after the show's creative team went to see her Broadway debut in The Boy Friend. Moss Hart agreed to direct after hearing only two songs. The music was arranged by Trude Rittman, Robert Russell Bennett and Gino Smart and orchestrated by Bennett, supported by Philip J. Lang and Jack Mason. Dominic McHugh: Loverly - The Life And Times Of My Fair Lady, ch. 5\n\nThe musical's script used several scenes that Shaw had written especially for the 1938 film version of Pygmalion, including the Embassy Ball sequence and the final scene of the 1938 film rather than the ending for Shaw's original play. The montage showing Eliza's lessons was also expanded, combining both Lerner and Shaw's dialogue. The artwork on the original playbill (and sleeve of the cast recording) is by Al Hirschfeld, who drew the playwright Shaw as a heavenly puppetmaster  pulling the strings on the Henry Higgins character, while Higgins in turn attempts to control Eliza Doolittle.\n\nProductions\n\nOriginal Broadway production\n\nThe musical had its pre-Broadway tryout at New Haven's Shubert Theatre. At the first preview Rex Harrison, who was unaccustomed to singing in front of a live orchestra, \"announced that under no circumstances would he go on that night...with those thirty-two interlopers in the pit\".Lerner, p. 104.  He locked himself in his dressing room and came out little more than an hour before curtain time. The whole company had been dismissed but were recalled, and opening night was a success.Schreiber, Brad.

In 1973, on an episode of her Emmy Award-winning ABC-TV variety series, Julie Andrews recalled that during the New Haven tryout, one of the songs written for the show, \"Say A Prayer For Me Tonight\" was dropped and then used two years later for the 1958 MGM musical Gigi.  My Fair Lady then played for four weeks at the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia, beginning on February 15, 1956.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway March 15, 1956, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in New York City. It transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre and then The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on September 29, 1962, after 2,717 performances, a record at the time. Moss Hart directed and Hanya Holm was choreographer. In addition to stars Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews and Stanley Holloway, the original cast included Robert Coote, Cathleen Nesbitt, John Michael King, and Reid Shelton.Suskin, Steven.

Coming at the height of Cold War tensions, just weeks after the closing of the East Berlin‚ÄìWest Berlin border and the erection of the Berlin Wall, this was the first staging of a Broadway musical in Berlin since World War II. As such it was seen as a symbol of West Berlin's cultural renaissance and resistance.

They are ever so much more than interpolations, or interruptions.'\"Block, Geoffrey. Enchanted Evenings: The Broadway Musical from Show Boat to Sondheim, Oxford University Press US, 2004, , p. 228.  The musical opened to \"unanimously glowing reviews, one of which said 'Don't bother reading this review now. You'd better sit right down and send for those tickets...' Critics praised the thoughtful use of Shaw's original play, the brilliance of the lyrics, and Loewe's well-integrated score.\"Everett, William A., Laird, Paul R.

The casting of Audrey Hepburn instead of Julie Andrews as Eliza was controversial, partly because theatregoers regarded Andrews as perfect for the part and partly because Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed (by Marni Nixon). Jack L. Warner, the head of Warner Bros., which produced the film, wanted \"a star with a great deal of name recognition\", but since Julie Andrews did not have any film experience, he thought a movie with her would not be as successful.Roman, James W.

(Andrews went on to star in Mary Poppins that same year for which she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actress.) Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart's original direction. He was also unhappy with the casting of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and that the film was shot in its entirety at the Warner Bros. studio rather than, as he would have preferred, in London.Lerner, The Street Where I Live pp 134‚Äì6. Despite the controversy, My Fair Lady was considered a major critical and box office success, ultimately going on to win eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture of the Year, Best Actor for Rex Harrison, and Best Director for George Cukor.\n\nUnrealized film in 2000s\n\nA new film adaptation was announced by Columbia Pictures in 2008, but as of May 5, 2014, the project had been shelved.

    "aggregatedText" : "My Fair Lady is a musical based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe.  The story concerns Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phoneticist, so that she may pass as a lady. The original Broadway and London shows starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.\n\nThe musical's 1956 Broadway production was a notable critical and popular success. It set a record for the longest run of any show on Broadway up to that time. It was followed by a hit London production, a popular film version, chart topping original cast and soundtrack albums and numerous revivals.  My Fair Lady has frequently been called \"the perfect musical\".See, e.g., Steyn, Mark. Broadway Babies Say Goodnight: Musicals Then and Now, Routledge (1999), p. 119  and [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r1&res\n9F0CEFDA143BF933A25751C1A965958260&oref=slogin this 1993 NY Times review]\n\nPlot\n\n;Act I\nOn a rainy night in Edwardian London, opera patrons are waiting under the arches of Covent Garden for cabs. Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl, runs into a young man called Freddy.  She admonishes him for spilling her bunches of violets in the mud, but she cheers up after selling one to an older gentleman. She then flies into an angry outburst when a man copying down her speech is pointed out to her. The man explains that he studies phonetics and can identify anyone's origin by their accent. He laments Eliza's dreadful speech, asking why so many English people don't speak properly and explaining his theory that this is what truly separates social classes, rather than looks or money (\"Why Can't the English?\"). He declares that in six months he could turn Eliza into a lady by teaching her to speak properly. The older gentleman introduces himself as Colonel Pickering, a linguist who has studied Indian dialects. The phoneticist introduces himself as Henry Higgins, and, as they both have always wanted to meet each other, Higgins invites Pickering to stay at his home in London. He distractedly throws his change into Eliza's basket, and she and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable, proper life (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\").\n\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, and his drinking companions, Harry and Jamie, all dustmen, stop by the next morning.  He is searching for money for a drink, and Eliza shares her profits with him (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\").  Pickering and Higgins are discussing vowels at Higgins's home when Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, informs Higgins that a young woman with a ghastly accent has come to see him.  It is Eliza, who has come to take speech lessons so she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop.  Pickering wagers that Higgins cannot make good on his claim and volunteers to pay for Eliza's lessons.  An intensive makeover of Eliza's speech, manners and dress begins in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball.  Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted, patient man who cannot get along with women (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"). To others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic.\n\nAlfred Doolittle is informed that his daughter has been taken in by Professor Higgins, and considers that he might be able to make a little money from the situation (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\" [Reprise]).\n\nDoolittle arrives at Higgins's house the next morning, claiming that Higgins is compromising Eliza's virtue.  Higgins is impressed by the man's natural gift for language and brazen lack of moral values. He and Doolittle agree that Eliza can continue to take lessons and live at Higgins's house if Higgins gives Doolittle five pounds for a spree.  Higgins flippantly recommends Doolittle to an American millionaire who has written to Higgins seeking a lecturer on moral values.  Meanwhile, Eliza endures speech tutoring, endlessly repeating phrases like \"In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen‚Äù (initially, the only \"h\" she aspirates is in \"hever\") and \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" (to practice the \"long a\" phoneme).  Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill Higgins, from sickness to drowning to a firing squad (\"Just You Wait\").  The servants lament the hard \"work\" Higgins does (\"The Servants' Chorus\").  Just as they give up, Eliza suddenly recites \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" in perfect upper-class style.  Higgins, Eliza, and Pickering happily dance around Higgins's study (\"The Rain in Spain\"). Thereafter she speaks with impeccable received pronunciation. Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed; she declares she is too excited to sleep (\"I Could Have Danced All Night\").\n\nFor her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse (\"Ascot Gavotte\").  Henry's mother reluctantly agrees to help Eliza make conversation, following Henry's advice that Eliza should stick to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.  Eliza makes a good impression at first with her polite manners but later shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to Cockney slang.  She does, however, capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, the young man she ran into in the opening scene.  Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, but she refuses to see him.  He declares that he will wait for her as long as necessary in the street outside Higgins's house (\"On the Street Where You Live\").\n\nEliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball, and after weeks of preparation, she is ready.  All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with her son, the prince (\"Embassy Waltz\"). Eliza then dances with Higgins. A rival and former student of Higgins, a Hungarian phonetician named Zoltan Karpathy, is employed by the hostess to discover Eliza's origins through her speech. Though Pickering and his mother caution him not to, Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.\n\n;Act II\nThe event is revealed to have been a success, with Zoltan Karpathy having concluded that Eliza is \"not only Hungarian, but of royal blood. She is a princess!\"  After the ball, Pickering flatters Higgins on his triumph, and Higgins expresses his pleasure that the experiment is now over (\"You Did It\"). The episode leaves Eliza feeling used and abandoned.  Higgins completely ignores Eliza until he mislays his slippers.  He asks her where they are, and she lashes out at him, leaving the clueless professor mystified by her ingratitude. When Eliza decides to leave Higgins, he insults her in frustration and storms off. Eliza cries as she prepares to leave (\"Just You Wait\" [Reprise]). She finds Freddy still waiting outside (\"On the Street Where You Live\" [Reprise]).  He begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she cuts him off, telling him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (\"Show Me\").  She and Freddy return to Covent Garden, where her friends do not recognize her with her newly refined bearing (\"The Flower Market/Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\" [Reprise]).  By chance, her father is there as well, dressed in a fine suit.  He explains that he received a surprise bequest of four thousand pounds a year from the American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry Eliza's \"stepmother\", the woman he has been living with for many years.  Eliza sees that she no longer belongs in Covent Garden, and she and Freddy depart.  Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (\"Get Me to the Church on Time\").\n\nHiggins awakens the next morning to find that, without Eliza, he has tea instead of coffee, and cannot find his own files.  He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (\"A Hymn to Him\"). Pickering, becoming annoyed with Higgins, leaves to stay with his friend at the Home Office. Higgins seeks his mother's advice and finds Eliza having tea with her.  Higgins's mother leaves Higgins and Eliza together. Eliza explains that Higgins has always treated her as a flower girl, but she learned to be a lady because Pickering treated her as one.  Higgins claims he treated her the same way that Pickering did because both Higgins and Pickering treat all women alike.  Eliza accuses him of wanting her only to fetch and carry for him, saying that she will marry Freddy because he loves her.  She declares she no longer needs Higgins, saying she was foolish to think she did (\"Without You\").  Higgins is struck by Eliza's spirit and independence and wants her to stay with him, but she tells him that he will not see her again.\n\nAs Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\"). He cannot bring himself to confess that he loves her, and insists to himself that if she marries Freddy and then comes back to him, he will not accept her. But he finds it difficult to imagine being alone again.  He reviews the recording he made of the morning Eliza first came to him for lessons.  He hears his own harsh words: \"She's so deliciously low! So horribly dirty!\"  Then the phonograph turns off, and a real voice speaks in a Cockney accent: \"I washed me face an' 'ands before I come, I did\".  It is Eliza, standing in the doorway, tentatively returning to him.  The musical ends on an ambiguous moment of possible reconciliation between teacher and pupil, as Higgins slouches and asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"\n\nCharacters and original Broadway cast\n\nThe original cast of the Broadway stage production:[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/my_fair_lady.htm \"'My Fair Lady' Synopsis, Cast, Scenes and Settings and Musical Numbers\"] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed December 7, 2011.\n\n* Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics ‚Äì Rex Harrison\n* Eliza Doolittle, a young Cockney flowerseller ‚Äì Julie Andrews \n* Alfred P.

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with The Chocolate Soldier, a Viennese operetta based on his play Arms and the Man, refused permission for Pygmalion to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist Alan Jay Lerner to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner Frederick Loewe began work.  They quickly realized, however, that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble.Lerner, p. 36.  Many people, including Oscar Hammerstein II, who, with Richard Rodgers, had also tried his hand at adapting Pygmalion into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.Lerner, p. 38.\n\nDuring this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize Li'l Abner when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about Pygmalion again.Lerner, p. 39.  When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All the insurmountable obstacles that stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realized that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\".Lerner, pp. 43‚Äì44. They then excitedly began writing the show.  However, Chase Manhattan Bank was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to Pygmalion were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe said, \"We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.\"Lerner, p. 47. For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions. The bank, in the end, granted them the musical rights.\n\nLerner settled on the title My Fair Lady, relating both to one of Shaw's provisional titles for Pygmalion, Fair Eliza, and to the final line of every verse of the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\".  Recalling that the Gershwins' 1925 musical Tell Me More had been titled My Fair Lady in its out-of-town tryout, and also had a musical number under that title, Lerner made a courtesy call to Ira Gershwin, alerting him to the use of the title for the Lerner and Loewe musical.\n\nNo√´l Coward was the first to be offered the role of Henry Higgins, but turned it down, suggesting the producers cast Rex Harrison instead.Morley, Sheridan.  A Talent to Amuse: A Biography of No√´l Coward, p. 369, Doubleday & Company, 1969. After much deliberation, Harrison agreed to accept the part. Mary Martin was an early choice for the role of Eliza Doolittle, but declined the role.[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/cvvpw/gallery/martin1.html \"Extravagant Crowd: Mary Martin\"], Beinecke Library, Yale University, accessed December 9, 2011. Young actress Julie Andrews was \"discovered\" and cast as Eliza after the show's creative team went to see her Broadway debut in The Boy Friend. Moss Hart agreed to direct after hearing only two songs. The music was arranged by Trude Rittman, Robert Russell Bennett and Gino Smart and orchestrated by Bennett, supported by Philip J. Lang and Jack Mason. Dominic McHugh: Loverly - The Life And Times Of My Fair Lady, ch. 5\n\nThe musical's script used several scenes that Shaw had written especially for the 1938 film version of Pygmalion, including the Embassy Ball sequence and the final scene of the 1938 film rather than the ending for Shaw's original play. The montage showing Eliza's lessons was also expanded, combining both Lerner and Shaw's dialogue. The artwork on the original playbill (and sleeve of the cast recording) is by Al Hirschfeld, who drew the playwright Shaw as a heavenly puppetmaster  pulling the strings on the Henry Higgins character, while Higgins in turn attempts to control Eliza Doolittle.\n\nProductions\n\nOriginal Broadway production\n\nThe musical had its pre-Broadway tryout at New Haven's Shubert Theatre. At the first preview Rex Harrison, who was unaccustomed to singing in front of a live orchestra, \"announced that under no circumstances would he go on that night...with those thirty-two interlopers in the pit\".Lerner, p. 104.  He locked himself in his dressing room and came out little more than an hour before curtain time. The whole company had been dismissed but were recalled, and opening night was a success.Schreiber, Brad. [https://books.google.com/books?idCmSENqFbn5EC&pg\nPA137 Stop the show!: a history of insane incidents and absurd accidents in the theater] (2006), Thunder's Mouth Press, , pp. 137‚Äì138. In 1973, on an episode of her Emmy Award-winning ABC-TV variety series, Julie Andrews recalled that during the New Haven tryout, one of the songs written for the show, \"Say A Prayer For Me Tonight\" was dropped and then used two years later for the 1958 MGM musical Gigi.  My Fair Lady then played for four weeks at the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia, beginning on February 15, 1956.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway March 15, 1956, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in New York City. It transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre and then The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on September 29, 1962, after 2,717 performances, a record at the time.

Coming at the height of Cold War tensions, just weeks after the closing of the East Berlin‚ÄìWest Berlin border and the erection of the Berlin Wall, this was the first staging of a Broadway musical in Berlin since World War II. As such it was seen as a symbol of West Berlin's cultural renaissance and resistance. Lost attendance from East Berlin (now no longer possible) was partly made up by a \"musical air bridge\" of flights bringing in patrons from West Germany, and the production was embraced by Berliners, running for two years.  \n\n2007 New York Philharmonic concert and US tour\n\nIn 2007 the New York Philharmonic held a full-costume concert presentation of the musical.

The musical opened to \"unanimously glowing reviews, one of which said 'Don't bother reading this review now. You'd better sit right down and send for those tickets...'

The casting of Audrey Hepburn instead of Julie Andrews as Eliza was controversial, partly because theatregoers regarded Andrews as perfect for the part and partly because Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed (by Marni Nixon). Jack L. Warner, the head of Warner Bros., which produced the film, wanted \"a star with a great deal of name recognition\", but since Julie Andrews did not have any film experience, he thought a movie with her would not be as successful.Roman, James W.

(Andrews went on to star in Mary Poppins that same year for which she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actress.) Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart's original direction. He was also unhappy with the casting of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and that the film was shot in its entirety at the Warner Bros. studio rather than, as he would have preferred, in London.Lerner, The Street Where I Live pp 134‚Äì6. Despite the controversy, My Fair Lady was considered a major critical and box office success, ultimately going on to win eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture of the Year, Best Actor for Rex Harrison, and Best Director for George Cukor.\n\nUnrealized film in 2000s\n\nA new film adaptation was announced by Columbia Pictures in 2008, but as of May 5, 2014, the project had been shelved.
