  "textBody" : "The National Anthem of Chile () is also known as Canción Nacional (National Song). It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions.

Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.\n\nThe Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in Santiago, in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.\n\nYears later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by Andrés Bello, retained the original chorus (\"Dulce patria, recibe los votos...\"). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1909.\n\nDuring the military government (1973–1990) of Augusto Pinochet, the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners).
