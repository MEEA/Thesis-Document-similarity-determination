  "textBody" : "Felix Bloch (23 October 1905 – 10 September 1983) was a Swiss physicist, working mainly in the U.S. He and Edward Mills Purcell were awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics for \"their development of new ways  and methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements.\"Sohlman, M (Ed.) Nobel Foundation directory 2003. Vastervik, Sweden: AB CO Ekblad; 2003.  In 1954–1955, he served for one year as the first Director-General of CERN. Felix Bloch made fundamental theoretical contributions to the understanding of the behavior electrons in crystal lattices, ferromagnetism, and nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\nLife and work\n\nBloch was born in Zürich, Switzerland to Jewish parents Gustav and Agnes Bloch.\n\nHe was educated at the Cantonal Gymnasium in Zürich and at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETHZ), also in Zürich. Initially studying engineering he soon changed to physics. During this time he attended lectures and seminars given by Peter Debye and Hermann Weyl at ETH Zürich and Erwin Schrödinger at the neighboring University of Zürich. A fellow student in these seminars was John von Neumann. Bloch graduated in 1927, and was encouraged by Debye to go to Leipzig to study with Werner Heisenberg. Bloch became Heisenberg's first graduate student, and gained his doctorate in 1928. His doctoral thesis established the quantum theory of solids, using Bloch waves to describe electrons in periodic lattices.\n\nHe remained in European academia, working on superconductivity with Wolfgang Pauli in Zürich; with Hans Kramers and Adriaan Fokker in Holland; with Heisenberg on ferromagnetism, where he developed a description of boundaries between magnetic domains, now known as \"Bloch walls\"; with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, where he worked on a theoretical description of the stopping of charged particles traveling through matter; and with Enrico Fermi in Rome. In 1932, Bloch returned to Leipzig to assume a position as \"Privatdozent\" (lecturer). In 1933, immediately after Hitler came to power, he left Germany because he was Jewish, returning to Zürich, before traveling to Paris to lecture at the Institut Henri Poincaré.[https://books.google.com/books?idPQgaAAAAYAAJ&q\n%22Because+of+his+Jewish+faith%22 \"Bloch, Felix\"], Current Biography, H. W. Wilson Company, 1954. Accessed 24 February 2013. \"Because of his Jewish faith, his position soon became uncomfortable and he went to Paris, where he lectured at the Institut Henri Poincaré.\"\n\nIn 1934, the chairman of Stanford Physics invited Bloch to join the faculty. Bloch accepted the offer and emigrated to the United States. In the fall of 1938, Bloch began working with the 37\" cyclotron at the University of California at Berkeley to determine the magnetic moment of the neutron.[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/bloch.html Felix Bloch, Nuclear Induction, Bloch Equations, Bloch Theorem, Bloch States]. Osti.gov. Retrieved on 26 June 2015. Bloch went on to become the first professor for theoretical physics at Stanford. In 1939, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nIn 1940 he married Lore Misch, a physicist working on X-ray crystallography, whom he had met at an American Physical Society meeting.[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002]. royalsoced.org.uk The couple had four children.\n\nDuring WWII, Bloch briefly worked on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos. Disliking the military atmosphere of the laboratory and uninterested in the theoretical work there, Bloch left to join the radar project at Harvard University.\n\nAfter the war, he concentrated on investigations into nuclear induction and nuclear magnetic resonance, which are the underlying principles of MRI.\n\n  In 1946 he proposed the Bloch equations which determine the time evolution of nuclear magnetization. Along with Edward Purcell, Bloch was awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on nuclear magnetic induction.\n\nWhen CERN was being set up in the early 1950s, its founders were searching for someone of the stature and international prestige to head the fledgling international laboratory, and in 1954 Professor Bloch became CERN's first Director-General, at the time when construction was getting under way on the present Meyrin site and plans for the first machines were being drawn up. After leaving CERN, he returned to Stanford University, where he in 1961 was made Max Stein Professor of Physics.\n\nAt Stanford, he was the advisor of Carson D. Jeffries, who became a professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn 1964, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nFelix Bloch died in Zürich in 1983.",
