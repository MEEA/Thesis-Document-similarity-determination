The five women sovereigns reigning after Jitō were Genmei, Genshō, Kōken/Shōtoku, Meishō, and Go-Sakuramachi.\n\nTraditional narrative\n\nEmpress Jitō was the daughter of Emperor Tenji. Her mother was Ochi-no-Iratsume, the daughter of Minister Ō-omi Soga no Yamada-no Ishikawa Maro. She was the wife of Emperor Tenmu, who was Tenji's half brother by another woman, and she succeeded him on the throne.Varley, H. Paul.

Gukanshō, p. 270.\n\nEvents of Jitō's reign\n\nJitō took responsibility for court administration after the death of her husband, Emperor Tenmu, who was also her uncle.  She acceded to the throne in 687 in order to ensure the eventual succession of her son, Kusakabe-shinnō.  Throughout this period, Empress Jitō ruled from the Fujiwara Palace in Yamato. In 689, Jitō prohibited Sugoroku,Nihon Shoki, Volume 30 in 690 at enthronement she performed special ritual then gave pardon and in 692 she travailed to Ise against council of minister Miwa-no-Asono-Takechimaro.Nihon Shoki, Volume, 30\n\nPrince Kusakabe was named as crown prince to succeed Jitō, but he died at a young age.  Kusakabe's son, Karu-no-o, was then named as Jitō's successor.  He eventually would become known as Emperor Monmu.\n\nEmpress Jitō reigned for eleven years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070327i1.html \"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl\",] Japan Times.

Empress Genmei, who was followed on the  throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\n\nIn 697, Jitō abdicated in Mommu's favor; and as a retired sovereign, she took the post-reign title daijō-tennō.  After this, her imperial successors who retired took the same title after abdication.\n\nJitō continued to hold power as a cloistered ruler, which became a persistent trend in Japanese politics.\n\nThe actual site of Jitō's grave is known.  This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jitō's mausoleum.
