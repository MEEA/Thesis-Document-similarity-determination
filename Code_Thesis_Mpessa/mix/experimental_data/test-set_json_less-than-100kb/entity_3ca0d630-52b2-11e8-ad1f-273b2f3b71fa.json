  "textBody" : "Marvin Lee Minsky (August 9, 1927 – January 24, 2016) was an American cognitive scientist concerned largely with research of artificial intelligence (AI), co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AI laboratory, and author of several texts concerning AI and philosophy.\n\nBiography\n\nMarvin Lee Minsky was born in New York City, to an eye surgeon father, Henry, and to a mother, Fannie, who was an activist of Zionist affairs.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nLJQjKkphxjUC&pgPA188&dq\nmarvin+minsky+jewish&hlen&ei\nQC_WTNf1EsK5jAeLg-24CQ&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n3&ved0CDYQ6AEwAg#v\nonepage&qmarvin%20minsky%20jewish&f\nfalse Science in the contemporary world: an encyclopedia]  His family was Jewish. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and the Bronx High School of Science. He later attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He then served in the US Navy from 1944 to 1945. He received a B.A. in mathematics from Harvard University (1950) and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University (1954).\n\nHe was on the MIT faculty from 1958 to his death. He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1958, and a year later he and John McCarthy initiated what is known now as the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences, and professor of electrical engineering and computer science.\n\nContributions in computer science\n\nMinsky's inventions include the first head-mounted graphical display (1963) and the confocal microscopeThe patent for Minsky's Microscopy Apparatus was applied for in 1957, and subsequently granted US Patent Number 3,013,467 in 1961. According to his published biography on the MIT Media Lab webpage, \"In 1956, when a Junior Fellow at Harvard, Minsky invented and built the first Confocal Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument with unprecedented resolution and image quality\". (1957, a predecessor to today's widely used confocal laser scanning microscope).  He developed, with Seymour Papert, the first Logo \"turtle\".  Minsky also built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, SNARC.\n\nMinsky wrote the book Perceptrons (with Seymour Papert), which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks. This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it to have had great importance in discouraging research of neural networks in the 1970s, and contributing to the so-called \"AI winter\". He also founded several other famous AI models. His book A framework for representing knowledge created a new paradigm in programming. While his Perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book, the theory of frames is in wide use. Minsky has also written on the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans, permitting communication.\n\nIn the early 1970s, at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, Minsky and Papert started developing what came to be known as the Society of Mind theory.  The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts.  Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.  In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for the general public.\n\nIn November 2006, Minsky published The Emotion Machine, a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories, often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones.  Recent drafts of the book are freely available from his webpage.\n\nRole in popular culture\n\nMinsky was an adviserFor more, see this interview,  on Stanley Kubrick's movie 2001: A Space Odyssey; one of the movie's characters, Victor Kaminski, was named in Minsky's honor. Minsky himself is explicitly mentioned in Arthur C. Clarke's derivative novel of the same name, where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial break-through in artificial intelligence in the then-future 1980s, paving the way for HAL 9000 in the early 21st century:\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1952, Minsky married pediatrician Gloria Rudisch; together they had three children. Minsky was a talented improvisational pianist who published musings on the relations between music and psychology.\n\nOpinions\n\nMinsky was an atheist and a signatory to the Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics. He was a critic of the Loebner Prize for conversational robots.[http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/index4.html Salon.com Technology | Artificial stupidity] \n\nMinsky believed that there is no fundamental difference between humans and machines, and that humans are machines whose \"intelligence\" emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi-autonomous agents that comprise the brain. He has stated that \"somewhere down the line, some computers will become more intelligent than most people,\" but that it's very hard to predict how fast progress will be. He has cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal, but believed that such negative scenarios are \"hard to take seriously\" because he was confident AI would go through \"a lot of testing\" before being deployed.\n\nDeath\n\nMinsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 88. Minsky was a member of Alcor's Scientific Advisory Board, and is believed to have been cryonically preserved by Alcor, 10:35-11:26: \"The night he died I got frantic calls from Alcor: Where's his body?... and I did hear back that they resolved the issue, although apparently on Wikipedia it says they don't know if it's resolved; do people know? It was resolved... I predict by 2045 we'll be able to revive Marvin...\" presumably as 'Patient 144', whose cooling procedures began on January 27, 2016.\n\nBibliography (selected)\n\n* 1967 – Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines, Prentice-Hall\n* 1986 – The Society of Mind\n* 2006 – The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind\n\nAwards and affiliations\n\nMinsky won the Turing Award (the greatest distinction in computer science) in 1969, the Japan Prize in 1990, the IJCAI Award for Research Excellence for 1991, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal from the Franklin Institute for 2001.[http://www.fi.edu/winners/2001/minsky_marvin.faw?winner_id=3528 Marvin Minsky – The Franklin Institute Awards – Laureate Database] .
