In Western philosophy, the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire marked the ending of Hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of Medieval philosophy, whereas in Eastern philosophy, the spread of Islam through the Arab Empire marked the end of Old Iranian philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of early Islamic philosophy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGenuinely philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously. Karl Jaspers termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an Axial Age in human thought.\n\nAncient Chinese philosophy\n\nChinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in China and other countries within the East Asian cultural sphere that share a common language, including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\nSchools of thought\n\nHundred Schools of Thought\n\nThe Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BCE,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112694/Chinese-philosophy#ref171469 \"Chinese philosophy\"], Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 4/6/2014 an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China. Even though this period – known in its earlier part as the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period – in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in East Asian countries. The intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. This period ended with the rise of the Qin Dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent. The Book of Han lists ten major schools, they are:\n* Confucianism, which teaches that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. A main idea of Confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection. Confucianism holds that one should give up one's life, if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of ren and yi.\n* Legalism. Often compared with Machiavelli, and foundational for the traditional Chinese bureaucratic empire, the Legalists examined administrative methods, emphasizing a realistic consolidation of the wealth and power of autocrat and state.\n* Taoism, a philosophy which emphasizes the Three Jewels of the Tao: compassion, moderation, and humility, while Taoist thought generally focuses on nature, the relationship between humanity and the cosmos; health and longevity; and wu wei (action through inaction). Harmony with the Universe, or the source thereof (Tao), is the intended result of many Taoist rules and practices.\n* Mohism, which advocated the idea of universal love: Mozi believed that \"everyone is equal before heaven\", and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love. His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist empiricism; he believed that human cognition ought to be based on one's perceptions – one's sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing – instead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction. Mozi advocated frugality, condemning the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music, which he denounced as extravagant.\n* Naturalism, the School of Naturalists or the Yin-yang school, which synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements;  Zou Yan is considered the founder of this school.\n* Agrarianism, or the School of Agrarianism, which advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. The Agrarians believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king Shen Nong, a folk hero which was portrayed in Chinese literature as \"working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached.\"\n* The Logicians or the School of Names, which focused on definition and logic. It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek sophists or dialecticians. The most notable Logician was Gongsun Longzi.\n* The School of Diplomacy or School of Vertical and Horizontal [Alliances], which focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle, so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics, and debate and lobbying skill. Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.\n* The Miscellaneous School, which integrated teachings from different schools; for instance, Lü Buwei found scholars from different schools to write a book called Lüshi Chunqiu cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws.\n* The School of \"Minor-talks\", which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street.\n* Another group is the School of the Military that studied strategy and the philosophy of war; Sunzi and Sun Bin were influential leaders. However, this school was not one of the \"Ten Schools\" defined by Hanshu.\n\nEarly Imperial China\n\nThe founder of the Qin Dynasty, who implemented Legalism as the official philosophy, quashed Mohist and Confucianist schools. Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the Han Dynasty adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.\n\nConfucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest thinker was Dong Zhongshu, who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination Old Text) that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the Xuanxue (mysterious learning), also called Neo-Taoism. The most important philosophers of this movement were Wang Bi, Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ming and wuming). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, was the concept of feng liu (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\nBuddhism arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the Northern and Southern, Sui and Tang Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about Laozi, founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to Buddha. Mahayana Buddhism was far more successful in China than its rival Hinayana, and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were Sengzhao and Daosheng. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the Chan sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the Zen sect.\n\nPhilosophers\n\n* Taoism\n** Laozi (5th–4th century BCE)\n** Zhuangzi (4th century BCE)\n** Zhang Daoling\n** Zhang Jue (died 184 CE)\n** Ge Hong (283 – 343 CE)\n* Confucianism\n** Confucius\n** Mencius\n** Xun Zi (c. 312 – 230 BCE)\n* Legalism\n** Li Si\n** Li Kui\n** Han Fei\n** Mi Su Yu\n** Shang Yang\n** Shen Buhai\n** Shen Dao\n* Mohism\n** Mozi\n** Song Xing\n* Logicians\n** Deng Xi\n** Hui Shi (380–305 BCE)\n** Gongsun Long (c. 325 – c. 250 BCE)\n* Agrarianism\n** Xu Xing\n* Naturalism\n** Zou Yan (305 – 240 BCE)\n* Neotaoism\n** Wang Bi\n** Guo Xiang\n** Xiang Xiu\n* School of Diplomacy\n** Guiguzi\n** Su Qin (380 – 284 BCE)\n** Zhang Yi  (bef. 329 – 309 BCE)\n** Yue Yi\n** Li Yiji (268 – 204 BCE)\n* School of the Military\n** Sunzi (c. 500 BCE)\n** Sun Bin (died 316 BCE)\n\nAncient Greek and Roman philosophy\n\nPhilosophers\n\nPresocratic philosophers\n\n* Milesian School\nThales (624 – c 546 BCE)\nAnaximander (610 – 546 BCE)\nAnaximenes of Miletus (c. 585 – c. 525 BCE)\n* Pythagoreans\nPythagoras (582 – 496 BCE)\nPhilolaus (470 – 380 BCE)\nAlcmaeon of Croton\nArchytas (428 – 347 BCE)\n* Heraclitus (535 – 475 BCE)\n* Eleatic School\nXenophanes (570 – 470 BCE)\nParmenides (510 – 440 BCE)\nZeno of Elea (490 – 430 BCE)\nMelissus of Samos (c. 470 BCE – ?)\n* Pluralists\nEmpedocles (490 – 430 BCE)\nAnaxagoras (500 – 428 BCE)\n* Atomists\nLeucippus (first half of 5th century BCE)\nDemocritus (460 – 370 BCE)\nMetrodorus of Chios (4th century BCE)\n* Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BCE)\n* Sophists\nProtagoras (490 – 420 BCE)\nGorgias (487 – 376 BCE)\nAntiphon (480 – 411 BCE)\nProdicus (465/450 – after 399 BCE)\nHippias (middle of the 5th century BCE)\nThrasymachus (459 – 400 BCE)\nCallicles\nCritias\nLycophron\n* Diogenes of Apollonia (c. 460 BCE – ?)\n\nClassical Greek philosophers\n\n* Socrates (469 – 399 BCE)\n* Euclid of Megara (450 – 380 BCE)\n* Antisthenes (445 – 360 BCE)\n* Aristippus (435 – 356 BCE)\n* Plato (428 – 347 BCE)\n* Speusippus (407 – 339 BCE)\n* Diogenes of Sinope (400 – 325 BCE)\n* Xenocrates (396 – 314 BCE)\n* Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE)\n* Stilpo (380 – 300 BCE)\n* Theophrastus (370 – 288 BCE)\n\nHellenistic philosophy\n\n* Pyrrho (365 – 275 BCE)\n* Epicurus (341 – 270 BCE)\n* Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger) (331 – 278 BCE)\n* Zeno of Citium (333 – 263 BCE)\n* Cleanthes (c. 330 – c. 230 BCE)\n* Timon (320 – 230 BCE)\n* Arcesilaus (316 – 232 BCE)\n* Menippus (3rd century BCE)\n* Archimedes (c. 287 – 212 BCE)\n* Chrysippus (280 – 207 BCE)\n* Carneades (214 – 129 BCE)\n* Clitomachus (187 – 109 BCE)\n* Metrodorus of Stratonicea (late 2nd century BCE)\n* Philo of Larissa (160 – 80 BCE)\n* Posidonius (135 – 51 BCE)\n* Antiochus of Ascalon (130 – 68 BCE)\n* Aenesidemus (1st century BCE)\n* Agrippa (1st century CE)\n\nHellenistic schools of thought\n\n* Cynicism\n* Eclecticism\n* Epicureanism\n* Middle Platonism\n* Neo-Platonism\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Peripatetic School\n* Pyrrhonism\n* Stoicism\n* Sophism\n\nEarly Roman and Christian philosophy\n\nSee also:  Christian philosophy\n* School of the Sextii\n\nPhilosophers during Roman times\n\n* Cicero (106 – 43 BCE)\n* Lucretius (94 – 55 BCE)\n* Seneca (4 BCE – 65 CE)\n* Musonius Rufus (30 – 100 CE)\n* Plutarch (45 – 120 CE)\n* Epictetus (55 – 135 CE)\n* Marcus Aurelius (121 – 180 CE)\n* Clement of Alexandria (150 – 215 CE)\n* Alcinous (philosopher) (2nd century CE)\n* Sextus Empiricus (3rd century CE)\n* Alexander of Aphrodisias (3rd century CE)\n* Ammonius Saccas (3rd century CE)\n*  Plotinus (205 – 270 CE)\n* Porphyry (232 – 304 CE)\n* Iamblichus (242 – 327 CE)\n* Themistius (317 – 388 CE)\n* Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 CE)\n* Proclus (411 – 485 CE)\n* Damascius (462 – 540 CE)\n* Boethius (472 – 524 CE)\n* Simplicius of Cilicia (490 – 560 CE)\n* John Philoponus (490 – 570 CE)\n\nAncient Indian philosophy \n\nThe ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions : Sramana tradition and Vedic tradition.\n\nVedic philosophy\n\nIndian philosophy begins with the Vedas where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous Rigvedic Hymn of Creation (Nasadiya Sukta) the poet says:\n\n\"Whence all creation had its origin,\nhe, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\nhe, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\nhe knows—or maybe even he does not know.\"\n\nIn the Vedic view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (Purusha). This leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed rta and causal law by karma. Nature (prakriti) is taken to have three qualities (sattva, rajas, and tamas).\n* Vedas\n* Upanishads\n* Hindu philosophy\n\nSramana philosophy\n\nJainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. Cārvāka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) (atheist) philosophy,  also known as Lokāyata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, Cārvāka, author of the Bārhaspatya-sūtras.\n\nClassical Indian philosophy\n\nIn classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:\n* What is the ontological nature of consciousness?\n* How is cognition itself experienced?\n* Is mind (chit) intentional or not?\n* Does cognition have its own structure?\n\nThe Six schools of Indian philosophy are:\n* Nyaya\n* Vaisheshika\n* Samkhya\n* Yoga\n* Mimamsa (Purva Mimamsa)\n* Vedanta (Uttara Mimamsa)\n\nAncient Indian philosophers\n\n1st millennium BCE\n\n* Parashara — writer of Viṣṇu Purāṇa.\n\nPhilosophers of Vedic Age (2000–600 BCE)\n\n* Rishi Narayana — seer of the Purusha Sukta of the Rig Veda.The significance of Purusha Sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pur.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda\n* Seven Rishis — Atri, Bharadwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Viswamitra.P. 285 Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary By S.

The first charter of human rights by Cyrus the Great as understood in the Cyrus cylinder is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by Zarathustra and developed in Zoroastrian schools of thought of the Achaemenid Era of Iranian history.Philip G.

Two chiefly important monk philosophers were Sengzhao and Daosheng. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the Chan sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the Zen sect.\n\nPhilosophers\n\n* Taoism\n** Laozi (5th–4th century BCE)\n** Zhuangzi (4th century BCE)\n** Zhang Daoling\n** Zhang Jue (died 184 CE)\n** Ge Hong (283 – 343 CE)\n* Confucianism\n** Confucius\n** Mencius\n** Xun Zi (c. 312 – 230 BCE)\n* Legalism\n** Li Si\n** Li Kui\n** Han Fei\n** Mi Su Yu\n** Shang Yang\n** Shen Buhai\n** Shen Dao\n* Mohism\n** Mozi\n** Song Xing\n* Logicians\n** Deng Xi\n** Hui Shi (380–305 BCE)\n** Gongsun Long (c. 325 – c. 250 BCE)\n* Agrarianism\n** Xu Xing\n* Naturalism\n** Zou Yan (305 – 240 BCE)\n* Neotaoism\n** Wang Bi\n** Guo Xiang\n** Xiang Xiu\n* School of Diplomacy\n** Guiguzi\n** Su Qin (380 – 284 BCE)\n** Zhang Yi  (bef. 329 – 309 BCE)\n** Yue Yi\n** Li Yiji (268 – 204 BCE)\n* School of the Military\n** Sunzi (c. 500 BCE)\n** Sun Bin (died 316 BCE)\n\nAncient Greek and Roman philosophy\n\nPhilosophers\n\nPresocratic philosophers\n\n* Milesian School\nThales (624 – c 546 BCE)\nAnaximander (610 – 546 BCE)\nAnaximenes of Miletus (c. 585 – c. 525 BCE)\n* Pythagoreans\nPythagoras (582 – 496 BCE)\nPhilolaus (470 – 380 BCE)\nAlcmaeon of Croton\nArchytas (428 – 347 BCE)\n* Heraclitus (535 – 475 BCE)\n* Eleatic School\nXenophanes (570 – 470 BCE)\nParmenides (510 – 440 BCE)\nZeno of Elea (490 – 430 BCE)\nMelissus of Samos (c. 470 BCE – ?)\n* Pluralists\nEmpedocles (490 – 430 BCE)\nAnaxagoras (500 – 428 BCE)\n* Atomists\nLeucippus (first half of 5th century BCE)\nDemocritus (460 – 370 BCE)\nMetrodorus of Chios (4th century BCE)\n* Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BCE)\n* Sophists\nProtagoras (490 – 420 BCE)\nGorgias (487 – 376 BCE)\nAntiphon (480 – 411 BCE)\nProdicus (465/450 – after 399 BCE)\nHippias (middle of the 5th century BCE)\nThrasymachus (459 – 400 BCE)\nCallicles\nCritias\nLycophron\n* Diogenes of Apollonia (c. 460 BCE – ?)\n\nClassical Greek philosophers\n\n* Socrates (469 – 399 BCE)\n* Euclid of Megara (450 – 380 BCE)\n* Antisthenes (445 – 360 BCE)\n* Aristippus (435 – 356 BCE)\n* Plato (428 – 347 BCE)\n* Speusippus (407 – 339 BCE)\n* Diogenes of Sinope (400 – 325 BCE)\n* Xenocrates (396 – 314 BCE)\n* Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE)\n* Stilpo (380 – 300 BCE)\n* Theophrastus (370 – 288 BCE)\n\nHellenistic philosophy\n\n* Pyrrho (365 – 275 BCE)\n* Epicurus (341 – 270 BCE)\n* Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger) (331 – 278 BCE)\n* Zeno of Citium (333 – 263 BCE)\n* Cleanthes (c. 330 – c. 230 BCE)\n* Timon (320 – 230 BCE)\n* Arcesilaus (316 – 232 BCE)\n* Menippus (3rd century BCE)\n* Archimedes (c. 287 – 212 BCE)\n* Chrysippus (280 – 207 BCE)\n* Carneades (214 – 129 BCE)\n* Clitomachus (187 – 109 BCE)\n* Metrodorus of Stratonicea (late 2nd century BCE)\n* Philo of Larissa (160 – 80 BCE)\n* Posidonius (135 – 51 BCE)\n* Antiochus of Ascalon (130 – 68 BCE)\n* Aenesidemus (1st century BCE)\n* Agrippa (1st century CE)\n\nHellenistic schools of thought\n\n* Cynicism\n* Eclecticism\n* Epicureanism\n* Middle Platonism\n* Neo-Platonism\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Peripatetic School\n* Pyrrhonism\n* Stoicism\n* Sophism\n\nEarly Roman and Christian philosophy\n\nSee also:  Christian philosophy\n* School of the Sextii\n\nPhilosophers during Roman times\n\n* Cicero (106 – 43 BCE)\n* Lucretius (94 – 55 BCE)\n* Seneca (4 BCE – 65 CE)\n* Musonius Rufus (30 – 100 CE)\n* Plutarch (45 – 120 CE)\n* Epictetus (55 – 135 CE)\n* Marcus Aurelius (121 – 180 CE)\n* Clement of Alexandria (150 – 215 CE)\n* Alcinous (philosopher) (2nd century CE)\n* Sextus Empiricus (3rd century CE)\n* Alexander of Aphrodisias (3rd century CE)\n* Ammonius Saccas (3rd century CE)\n*  Plotinus (205 – 270 CE)\n* Porphyry (232 – 304 CE)\n* Iamblichus (242 – 327 CE)\n* Themistius (317 – 388 CE)\n* Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 CE)\n* Proclus (411 – 485 CE)\n* Damascius (462 – 540 CE)\n* Boethius (472 – 524 CE)\n* Simplicius of Cilicia (490 – 560 CE)\n* John Philoponus (490 – 570 CE)\n\nAncient Indian philosophy \n\nThe ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions : Sramana tradition and Vedic tradition.\n\nVedic philosophy\n\nIndian philosophy begins with the Vedas where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous Rigvedic Hymn of Creation (Nasadiya Sukta) the poet says:\n\n\"Whence all creation had its origin,\nhe, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\nhe, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\nhe knows—or maybe even he does not know.\"\n\nIn the Vedic view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (Purusha). This leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed rta and causal law by karma. Nature (prakriti) is taken to have three qualities (sattva, rajas, and tamas).\n* Vedas\n* Upanishads\n* Hindu philosophy\n\nSramana philosophy\n\nJainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. Cārvāka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) (atheist) philosophy,  also known as Lokāyata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, Cārvāka, author of the Bārhaspatya-sūtras.\n\nClassical Indian philosophy\n\nIn classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:\n* What is the ontological nature of consciousness?\n* How is cognition itself experienced?\n* Is mind (chit) intentional or not?\n* Does cognition have its own structure?\n\nThe Six schools of Indian philosophy are:\n* Nyaya\n* Vaisheshika\n* Samkhya\n* Yoga\n* Mimamsa (Purva Mimamsa)\n* Vedanta (Uttara Mimamsa)\n\nAncient Indian philosophers\n\n1st millennium BCE\n\n* Parashara — writer of Viṣṇu Purāṇa.\n\nPhilosophers of Vedic Age (2000–600 BCE)\n\n* Rishi Narayana — seer of the Purusha Sukta of the Rig Veda.The significance of Purusha Sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pur.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda\n* Seven Rishis — Atri, Bharadwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Viswamitra.P. 285 Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary By S.

The first charter of human rights by Cyrus the Great as understood in the Cyrus cylinder is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by Zarathustra and developed in Zoroastrian schools of thought of the Achaemenid Era of Iranian history.Philip G.
