  "textBody" : "A football player is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union.\n\nIt has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world, and many play the other forms of football.\n\nCareer\n\nJean-Pierre Papin has described football as a \"universal language\". Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.\n\nFootballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.\n\nWages\n\nWages in some top men's leagues are significantly higher than other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn average wages of about $1 million per year. In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, some players earn an average wage up to $6 to $8 million per year.[https://soccermommanual.com/soccer-salaries-how-much-do-soccer-players-make/ Wages of wealthiest clubs in european football leagues] The best players of those clubs can earn up to $70 million per year.[https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45egml/no-1-cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid/ Best football player wages] \n\nHowever, only a fraction of men's professional football (soccer) players are paid at this level. Wages may be much more moderate in other divisions and leagues, and a significant number of players are semi-professional. For example, the average annual salary for soccer players in the American Major League Soccer (which started in 2009) for the 2013 season was $148,693, with significant variations depending on player position (goalkeepers for example earned $85,296, whereas forwards earned $251,805[http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-amount-money-professional-soccer-player-per-year-35008.html Average wages of soccer players in MLS]). \n\nAverage salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) (which started in 2012) earn $15,000 to $40,000 per year as of January 2017.\n\nPost-retirement\n\nA minority of retired footballers continue working full-time within football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second teamers and reserves. However, some experience chronic health issues, see below.\n\nSkills\n\nPsychological aspects of performance\n\nResearch shows that association football players that take less than 200ms after the referee blows their whistle for a penalty kick are significantly more likely to miss scoring than those that take over a second.[http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/09/football-players-who-rush-penalty-kicks.html Football players who rush penalty kicks are less likely to score, 10 September 2009.]\n\nHealth issues\n\nAn Irish 2002 study of association and Gaelic football players characterised players as \"lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance\". The opposite is the case for American football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems.\n\nA 2000 study documented injuries sustained by Czech [association] football players at all levels:\n\nPatellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an overused injury that also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. It is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. Jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. The chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain.\n\nAlthough levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average, some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. Head injuries are a particular concern.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe average life expectancy or lifespan of an American football NFL player has been reported to be extremely low, only 53 to 59 years depending on playing position. However, a 2012 study reported that retired NFL players have a lower death rate than men in the general population. An oft-cited life expectancy of 58 years has been claimed by Sports Illustrated to be based on a myth. According to a 2007 study, which also claims that little supporting data is available, retired American football players had \"long and fulfilling careers with no apparent long-term detrimental effects on physical or mental health scores despite a high prevalence of arthritis\". One explanation is that \"life expectancy\" is ambiguous: it may in some contexts refer to the expected age of death of a player, and in other contexts to the expected remaining number of life years.\n\nAs for association football, a 2011 German study found that German national team players live 1.9 years less than the general male population. [http://www.oliverkuss.de/science/publications/Kuss_Longevity_of_Soccer_Players_An_Investigation_of_all_German_Internationals_from_1908-2006.pdf Pdf.]\n\nA 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of All Blacks is the same as for the general population.\n\nHead\n\nAmerican football players are prone to head injuries such as concussion. In later life, this increases the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's.\nProfessional American football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions.\n\nProbably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In a 1987 study of former Norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, i.e. brain damage. A 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (CTHI): (free access)\n\nKnee\n\nAnterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles.\n\nHip\n\nAn increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players.\n\nMuscles\n\nA 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles.\n\nSleep and psychological functioning\n\nIn a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players.\n\nThe rate of suicide among NFL vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population.\n\nFIFA response\n\nIn 2012, FIFA released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players.\n\nLists of players\n\n*Lists of association football players\n*List of American football players\n*\n*List of footballers (Gaelic football)\n*:Category:Lists of rugby league footballers",
