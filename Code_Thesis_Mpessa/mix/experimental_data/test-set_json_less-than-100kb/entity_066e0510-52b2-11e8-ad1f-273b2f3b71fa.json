  "textBody" : "Gosford is a major New South Wales suburb located in the heart of the Central Coast Region, about 76 km north of the Sydney CBD. The suburb is situated at the northern extremity of Brisbane Water, an extensive northern branch of the Hawkesbury River estuary and Broken Bay.\n\nThe city is the administrative centre of the Central Coast region,  which is the third largest urban area in New South Wales after Sydney and Newcastle, following its formation from the combination of the previous Gosford and Wyong Shire Councils. Gosford has been earmarked as a vital CBD spine under the NSW Metropolitan Strategy. The suburb's population was 3,499 in the 2016 census.\n\nHistory\n\nUntil white settlement, the area around Gosford was inhabited by the Guringai peoples, who were principally coastal-dwellers,[http://www.centralcoastaustralia.com.au/AreaInfo/towns_Gosford.asp Gosford - Central Coast] and the Darkinjung people that inhabited the hinterland. \nAlong with the other land around the Hawkesbury River estuary, the Brisbane Water district was explored during the early stages of the settlement of New South Wales.  \n\nGosford itself was explored by Governor Phillip between 1788 and 1789.  The area was difficult to access and settlement did not start before 1823. By the late 19th century the agriculture in the region was diversifying, with market gardens and citrus orchards occupying the rich soil left after the timber harvest. The road between Hawkesbury (near Pittwater) and Brisbane Water was a cart wheel track even in 1850.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210180914/http://www.gosford-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/about/gosfordhistory.htm History of Gosford]\n\nConvicts once lived and worked in the Gosford area. In 1825, Gosford's population reached 100, of whom 50% were convicts. \n\nEast Gosford was the first centre of settlement. Gosford was named in 1839 after Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford – a friend of the then Governor of New South Wales George Gipps. Acheson's title derives its name from Gosford, a townland (sub-division) of Markethill in County Armagh in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 1887, the rail link to Sydney was completed, requiring a bridge over the Hawkesbury River and a tunnel through the sandstone ridge west of Woy Woy.  The introduction of this transport link and then the Pacific Highway in 1930 accelerated the development of the region.\n\nGosford became a town in 1885 and was declared a municipality in 1886.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn the , the most common countries of birth of people in Gosford were Australia 63.6%, England 4.4%, Mainland China 2.4%, India 1.9%, New Zealand 1.9% and South Korea 1.1%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 24.3%, Catholic 21.6%, Anglican 18.0%, Buddhism 3.4% and Uniting Church 2.8%.\nMedia\n\nPublications\n\nGosford Community News has been published fortnightly by Ducks Crossing Publications since 2010.\n\nExpress Advocate: News Limited publish a free weekly suburban style newspaper in the News Local group.\nBroadcasting\n\nRadio stations available:\n* 2GO - part of Southern Cross Austereo\n* Sea FM\n* ABC 92.5\n* CoastFM 96.3\n* StarFM 104.5\n* EVT FM - Chinese radio network\n \nClimate\n\nGosford has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa)[http://en.climate-data.org/location/1312/ CLIMATE: GOSFORD] with warm summers and mild winters. In summer, temperatures average about 27-28 °C in the day with high humidity and about 17-18 °C at night. Winters are mild with cool overnight temperatures and mild to occasionally warm daytime temperatures with lower humidity. Average rainfall is 1333mm, much of which falls in the late summer and autumn. Records range from a maximum of  on 18 January 2013, to a low of  on 16 July 1970.\n\nCentral Business District/Town Centre \n\nGosford proper is located in a valley with President's Hill on the city's western border, Rumbalara Reserve on its eastern border, and Brisbane water to the city's south.  Mann Street, Gosford's main street and part of the Pacific Highway, runs north-south and contains the frontage for much of the commercial district. \n\nIn the centre of Gosford is a shopping and community precinct, including Kibble Park, William Street Mall, Gosford City Library, the Imperial Shopping Centre and a full range of shops, cafes, banks and services, especially along William Street Mall.\n\nA renewed period of optimism has followed demolition of several derelict buildings and several infrastructure investment projects including the full fibre optic telecommunications rollout of the National Broadband Network in 2012 in the city's CBD[http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/459837/nbn_services_go_live_gosford/ NBN services go live in Gosford] as well as the so-called Kibbleplex project, announced in 2013[http://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured-news/gosford-expansion Gosford funding] that plans to house the new regional library, tertiary teaching rooms and associated organisations. Gosford Classic Car Museum opened in 2016 at nearby suburb of West Gosford.\n\nTransport\n\nThe Central Coast Highway cuts through Gosford's waterfront area, while its predecessor the Pacific Highway takes on several names through the CBD itself.
