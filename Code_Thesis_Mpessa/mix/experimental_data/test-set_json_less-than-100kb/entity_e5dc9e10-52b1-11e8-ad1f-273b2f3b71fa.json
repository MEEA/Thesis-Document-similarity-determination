  "textBody" : "December is mpthe twelfth and final month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and is the seventh and last of seven months to have a length of 31 days. \n\nDecember got its name from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the Roman calendar, which began in March. The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.Macrobius, Saturnalia, tr. Percival Vaughan Davies (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969), book I, chapters 12–13, pp. 89–95. \n\nIn Ancient Rome, as one of the four Agonalia, this day in honor of Sol Indiges was held on December 11, as was Septimontium. Dies natalis (birthday) was held at the temple of Tellus on December 13, Consualia was held on December 15, Saturnalia was held December 17–23, Opiconsivia was held on December 19, Divalia was held on December 21, Larentalia was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of Sol Invictus was held on December 25.

The French Republican Calendar contained December within the months of Frimaire and Nivôse.\n\nAstronomy\n\nDecember contains the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours, and the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). December in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to June in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the astronomical winter is traditionally 21 December or the date of the solstice.\n\nMeteor showers occurring in December are the Andromedids (September 25 – December 6, peaking around November 9), the  Canis-Minorids (December 4 – December 15, peaking around December 10–11), the Coma Berenicids (December 12 to December 23, peaking around December 16), the Delta Cancrids (December 14 to February 14, the main shower from January 1 to January 24, peaking on January 17), the Geminids (December 13–14), the Monocerotids (December 7 to December 20, peaking on December 9. This shower can also start in November), the Phoenicids (November 29 to December 9, with a peak occurring around 5/6 December), the Quadrantids (typically a January shower but can also start in December), the Sigma Hydrids (December 4–15), and the Ursids (December 17-to December 25/26, peaking around December 22).\n\nAstrology\n\n*The zodiac signs for the month of December are Sagittarius (until December 21) and Capricorn (December 22 onwards).\n\nDecember symbols\n \n*December's birth flower is the narcissus.\n*December's birthstones are the turquoise, zircon, and tanzanite.\n\nObservances\n\nThis list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.\nNon-Gregorian observances: 2018 dates\n\n(Please note that all Baha'i, Islamic, and Jewish observances begin at sundown prior to the date listed, and end at sundown of the date in question unless otherwise noted.)\n*December 22: Poya (Buddhism, public holiday in Sri Lanka)\n\nMonth-long observances\n\n*In Catholic tradition, December is the Month of the Advent of Christ.\n*National Egg Nog Month (United States)\n*National Impaired Driving Prevention Month (United States)\n*National Fruit Cake Month (United States)\n*National Pear Month (United States)\n*No Gender December (International)\n\nMovable observances: 2017 dates\n\n*Small Business Saturday UK: December 2\n*Chalica (Unitarian Universalism): December 4–11\n*Human Rights and Peace Day (Kiribati): December 9\nLast Week of November: November 26 – December 3\n*AIDS Awareness Week (Canada) \nFirst Friday: December 1\n*Farmer's Day (Ghana)\n*Gospel Day (Marshall Islands) \nFirst Sunday: December 3\n*First Presidency's Christmas Devotional (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\n*Good Neighborliness Day (Turkmenistan)\n*Sindhi Cultural Day (Sindhi diaspora)\nFourth Sunday before Christmas Day: December 3\n*Advent Sunday (start of Advent, Western Christianity)\nSecond Monday: December 11\n*Green Monday\n*National Tree Planting Day (Malawi)\nSunday two weeks before Christmas: December 12\n*Detinjci (Serbia)\nDecember 15, unless the date falls on a Sunday, then December 16: December 15\n*Koninkrijksdag (Kingdom of the Netherlands)\nSecond-final Sunday before Christmas Day: December 17\n*Gaudete Sunday (Western Christianity)\nThursday before Christmas: December 21\n*Chewidden Thursday (Cornwall) (Thursday of the last full week before Christmas)\n*National Regifting Day (United States) \nWinter Solstice: December 21\n*Blue Christmas (holiday)\n*Brumalia (Ancient Rome)\n*Dongzhi Festival (Asia)\n*Global Orgasm\n*Korochun (Slavic)\n*Midsummer in the Southern Hemisphere.
