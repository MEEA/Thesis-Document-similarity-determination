  "textBody" : "is a 1966 Japanese science fiction kaiju film featuring Godzilla, produced and distributed by Toho. The film is directed by Jun Fukuda with special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa with supervision by Eiji Tsuburaya and stars Akira Takarada, Kumi Mizuno, Akihiko Hirata, and Eisei Amamoto, with Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla and Hiroshi Sekita as Ebirah. It is the seventh film in the Godzilla franchise and Shōwa series. The film was released in Japan on December 17, 1966 and directly to television in the United States in 1968 as Godzilla versus the Sea Monster.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter Yata (Toru Ibuki) is lost at sea, his brother Ryota (Toru Watanabe) steals a yacht with his two friends and a bank robber. However, the crew runs afoul of the giant lobster Ebirah and washes up on the shore of Letchi Island. There, a terrorist organization manufactures heavy water for their purposes, as well as a chemical that keeps Ebirah at bay. The organization, known as the Red Bamboo, has enslaved natives from Infant Island to help them. But the natives hope to awaken Mothra (now a full-grown moth metamorphosed from the larva that appeared in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster) to rescue them.\n\nIn their efforts to avoid capture, Ryota and his friends, aided by a beautiful native girl, stumble across Godzilla sleeping within a cliffside cavern. The group devises a plan to defeat the Red Bamboo and escape from the island. In the process, they wake Godzilla using a makeshift lightning rod. Godzilla fights Ebirah, but the giant crustacean escapes. Godzilla is then attacked by Daikondoro, a giant condor and a squadron of Red Bamboo fighter jets, but he destroys them both.\n\nThe humans retrieve the missing Yata and free the enslaved natives as Godzilla begins to destroy the base. Godzilla smashes a tower that has a self-destruct button that makes the island unstable. Godzilla fights Ebirah and defeats it, ripping off both Ebirah's claws and causing it to retreat into the sea. The natives summon Mothra to save everyone. However, Godzilla challenges Mothra when she gets to the island. Mothra manages to push Godzilla away and carry the people off. Godzilla escapes from the island just before it explodes.\n\nCast\n\n* Akira Takarada as Yoshimura\n* Toru Watanabe as Ryota Kane\n* Toru Ibuki as Yata Kane\n* Chotaro Togin as Ichino\n* Hideo Sunazuka as Nita\n* Kumi Mizuno as Dayo\n* Pair Bambi as Mothra's priestesses\n* Jun Tazaki as Red Bamboo Commander\n* Akihiko Hirata as Red Bamboo Captain Ryuui\n* Hideyo Amamoto as Red Bamboo Captain Naval Officer\n* Yutaka Sada as Farmer\n* Hisaya Ito as Red Bamboo Scientist\n* Tadashi Okabe as Red Bamboo Scientist\n* Chieko Nakakita as Mrs. Kane\n* Ikio Sawamura as Elderly Slave\n* Shoichi Hirose as escaped slave\n* Kazuo Suzuki as escaped slave\n* Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla\n* Hiroshi Sekita as Ebirah\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film was originally written as a King Kong film, titled Operation Robinson Crusoe, but Rankin/Bass Productions rejected the project; however, Toho proceeded with the project anyway and replaced King Kong with Godzilla (that means fans missed a Kong vs Mothra fight).

Toho had decided to set the film on an island in order to cut back on special effects costs. Arikawa has cited the film as a frustrating experience, stating, \"There were major limitations on the budget from the studio.
