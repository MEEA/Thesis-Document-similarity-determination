One source mentions 200 000 Slavs and 400 000 Hungarians, while other sources often don't give estimates for both, making comparison more difficult.

In the historical demographics the largest earlier shock was the Mongol Invasion of Hungary, several plagues also took a toll on the country's population.\n\nAccording to the demographers, about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Mohács, however the Hungarian ethnic group became a minority in its own country in the 18th century due to the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries. Major territorial changes made Hungary ethnically homogeneous after World War I.

Hungarian was spoken by 96% of the total population and was the mother language of 89%. The percentage and the absolute number of all non-Hungarian nationalities decreased in the next decades, although the total population of the country increased.\n\nNote: 300.000 Hungarian refugees fled to Hungary from the territory of successor states (Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) after the WW I.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1945\n\nHungary expanded its borders and regained territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia at the outset of the war. These annexations were affirmed under the Munich Agreement (1938), two Vienna Awards (1938 and 1940), Carpathian Ruthenia and parts of Yugoslavia were occupied and annexed in 1939 and 1941, respectively.\nThe population of Northern Transylvania, according to the Hungarian census from 1941 counted 53.5% Hungarians and 39.1% Romanians.Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 116-153 [https://books.google.com/books?id\n-zZ_NVM9mNEC&pgPA120&dq\nNorthern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&hlen&ei\nFQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n10&ved0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v\nonepage&q1941%20census%20data&f\nfalse]\nThe territory of Bácska had 789,705 inhabitants, and 45,4% or 47,2% declared themselves to be Hungarian native speakers or ethnic Hungarians.\nThe percentage of Hungarian speakers was 84% in southern Czechoslovakia and 15% in the Sub-Carpathian Rus.\n\nAfter WW II: 1949–1990\n\nAfter World War II, about 200,000 Germans were deported to Germany according to the decree of the Potsdam Conference. Under the forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary. After these population movements Hungary became an ethnically almost homogeneous country except the rapidly growing number of Romani people in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nFor historical reasons, significant Hungarian minority populations can be found in the surrounding countries, notably in Ukraine (in Transcarpathia), Slovakia, Romania (in Transylvania), and Serbia (in Vojvodina). Austria (in Burgenland), Croatia, and Slovenia (Prekmurje) are also host to a number of ethnic Hungarians.\n\n2001–2011\n\n*Note: In 2001 570,537, in 2011 1,455,883 people did not give answer for ethnicity. Percentages calculated excluding these people. Moreover, people were able to give more than one answer on the question asking for the minorities (for example, people were allowed to write Hungarian as their nationality and German as a nationality being influenced by), hence the sum of the above exceeds the number of population.\n*Methodology had changed in 2001 and 2011 also, so ethnicity results of the censuses are not comparable very well.\n\nHistorical ethnic groups of Hungary\n\nWhen the Hungarians invaded the Carpathian Basin, it was inhabited by West Slavic and Avar peoples. Written sources from the 9th century also suggest that some groups of Onogurs and Bulgars occupied the valley of the river Mureş at the time of the Magyars’ invasion. There is a dispute as to whether Romanian population existed in Transylvania during that time.\n\nThe Roma minority\n\nThe Romani people arrived in Hungary in the fifteenth century from Turkey.Huping Ling, Emerging voices: experiences of underrepresented Asian Americans, Rutgers University Press, 2008, p. 111 [https://books.google.com/books?idEJfrLhHyjM8C&pg\nPA111&dqRoma+people+16th+hungary&hl\nen&eiuMIbTca2IcqKhQekjbW3Dg&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum10&ved\n0CFEQ6AEwCQ#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] Nowadays, the real number of Roma in Hungary is a disputed question. In the 2001 census only 190 046 (2%) called themselves Roma, but experts and Roma organisations estimate that there are between 450,000 and 1,000,000 Roma living in Hungary.[http://www.demos.hu/Audit Stratégiai Audit 2005 - DEMOS Magyarország].

Based on current demographic trends, a 2006 estimate by Central European Management Intelligence claims that the proportion of the Roma population will double by 2050, putting the percentage of its Roma community at around 14-15% of the country's population.\n\nThere are problems related to the Roma minority in Hungary, and the very subject is a heated and disputed topic.\n\nObjective problems:\n* Slightly more than 80% of Roma children complete primary education, but only one third continue studies into the intermediate (secondary) level. This is far lower than the more than 90% proportion of children of non-Roma families who continue studies at an intermediate level. Less than 1% of Roma hold higher educational certificates.\n* Poverty: most of the Roma people live in significantly worse conditions than others.\n* Bad health conditions: life expectancy is about 10 years less compared to non-Romas\n* Lack of debate regarding the subject: academic researchers and members of the mainstream press disregard any critics and study the subject in the canonical viewpoint. Critics don't have the funds necessary to perform alternative studies.\n\nKabars\n\nThree Kabar tribes joined to the Hungarians and participated in the Hungarian conquest of Hungary. They settled mostly in Bihar county.\n\nBöszörménys\n\nThe Muslim Böszörménys migrated to the Carpathian Basin in the course of the 10th-12th centuries and they were composed of various ethnic groups.

The city of Ózd got its name after them.\n\nJassics\n\nThe Jassic (Jász in Hungarian) people were a nomadic tribe which settled -with the Cumans- in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 13th century. Their name is almost certainly related to that of the Iazyges. Béla IV, king of Hungary granted them asylum and they became a privileged community with the right of self-government. During the centuries they were fully assimilated to the Hungarian population, their language disappeared, but they preserved their Jassic identity and their regional autonomy until 1876. Over a dozen settlements in Central Hungary (e.g. Jászberény, Jászárokszállás, Jászfényszaru) still bear their name.\n\nCumans\n\nDuring the Russian campaign, the Mongols drove some 200,000 Cumans, a nomadic tribe who had opposed them, west of the Carpathian Mountains. There, the Cumans appealed to King Béla IV of Hungary for protection.[http://www.historynet.com/mongol-invasions-battle-of-liegnitz.htm Mongol Invasions: Battle of Liegnitz], HistoryNet In the Kingdom of Hungary, Cumans created two regions named Cumania (Kunság in Hungarian): Greater Cumania (Nagykunság) and Little Cumania (Kiskunság), both located the Great Hungarian Plain. Here, the Cumans maintained their autonomy, language and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. According to  Pálóczi's estimation originally 70-80,000 Cumans settled in Hungary.\n\nRomanians\n\nThe oldest extant documents from Transylvania make reference to Vlachs too.

There are different estimations in connection with number of Romanians in Kingdom of Hungary. According to researches based on place-names, 511 villages of Transylvania and Banat appear in documents at the end of the 13th century, however only 3 of them bore Romanian names. Around 1400 AD, Transylvania and Banat consisted of 1757 villages, though only 76 (4.3%) of them were Romanian.Louis L.

In 1600 the Romanian inhabitants were primarily peasants, comprising more than 60 percent of the population. By 1700, the Romanian ethnic group consisted of 40 percent of the Transylvanian population and their number raised even more in the 18th century.

After WWII a major population exchange with Czechoslovakia was carried out: about 73,000 Slovaks were transferred to Slovakia, replaced by an incomparable number of Hungarians.Janusz Bugajski, [https://books.google.com/books?idm_AcqFSfvzAC&dq\nkadar+hungary+magyarization&source=gbs_navlinks_s Ethnic politics in Eastern Europe: a guide to nationality policies, organizations, and parties] M.E. Sharpe, 1995, p. 402\n\nSerbs\n\nFrom the 14th century, escaping from the Ottoman threat, a large number of Serbs migrated to the Hungarian Kingdom. After the Battle of Mohács, most of the territory of Hungary got into Ottoman rule. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic immigrants settled in Hungary. Most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were South Slavs (the Janissary). After the Turkish withdrawal, Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg rule, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area around 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg-Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in Hungary.\n\nGermans\n\nThree waves of German migration can be distinguished in Hungary before the 20th century. The first two waves of settlers arrived to the Hungarian Kingdom in the Middle Ages (11th and 13th centuries) in Upper Hungary and in Southern Transylvania (Transylvanian Saxons).\n\nThe third, largest wave of German-speaking immigrants into Hungary occurred after the withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire from Hungarian territory, after the Treaty of Karlowitz. Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers immigrated to the regions of Southern Hungary, mostly region of Bánát, Bács-Bodrog, Baranya and Tolna counties (as well as into present-day Romania and Yugoslavia), which had been depopulated by the Ottoman wars. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents (collectively known as Danube Swabians). In 2011, 131,951 people declared to be German in Hungary (1,6%).[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/eng/volumes/18/tables/load1_30_1.html \"18.

Croat communities were spread mostly in the western and southern part of the country and along the Danube, including Budapest.\n\nPoles\n\nThe Poles lived at the northern borders of Kingdom of Hungary from the arrival of the Hungarians.\n\nSlovenes\n\nThe Slovenes (Vendek in Hungarian) lived in the western part of the Carpathian basin before the Hungarian conquest. In the 11th and 12th century, the current linguistic and ethnic border between the Hungarian and Slovene people was established. Nowadays, they live in Vendvidék (Slovenska krajina in Slovenians) between the Mura and the Rába rivers. In 2001, there were around 5,000 Slovenes in Hungary.\n\nJews\n\nThe first historical document about Jews of Hungary is the letter written about 960 to King Joseph of the Khazars by Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the Jewish statesman of Córdoba, in which he says Jews living in \"the country of Hungarin\". There are Jewish inscriptions on tombs and monuments in Pannonia (Roman Hungary) dated to the second or third century CE.\n\nArmenians\n\nThe first Armenians came to Hungary from the Balkans in the 10 - 11th century.\n\nGreeks\n\nGreeks migrated to Kingdom of Hungary from the 15th and 16th centuries. Mass migrations did not occur until the 17th century, the largest waves being in 1718 and 1760–1770; they were primarily connected to the economic conditions of the period. It is estimated that 10,000 Greeks emigrated to Hungary in the second half of the 18th century. A number of Greeks Communists escaped to Hungary \nafter the Greek Civil War, notably in the 'Greek' village of Beloiannisz.\n\nBulgarians\n\nThe town of Szentendre and the surrounding villages were inhabited by Bulgarians since the Middle Ages. However, present day Bulgarians are largely descended from gardeners who migrated to Hungary from the 18th century.\n\nReligion\n\nThe majority of Hungarians became Christian in the 11th century. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the Reformation took place and, as a result, first Lutheranism, then soon afterwards Calvinism, became the religion of almost the entire population.\nIn the second half of the 16th century, however, Jesuits led a successful campaign of counterreformation among the Hungarians, although Protestantism survived as the faith of a significant minority. Orthodox Christianity in Hungary has been the religion mainly of some national minorities in the country, notably Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs.\n\nFaith Church, one of Europe's largest Pentecostal churches, is also located in Hungary. Hungary has historically been home to a significant Jewish community.\n\nAccording to 2011 census data, Christianity is the largest religion in Hungary, with around 5.2 million adherents (52.9%), while the largest denomination in Hungary is Catholicism (38.9% — Roman Catholicism 37.1%; Greek Catholicism 1.8%). There is a significant Calvinist minority (11.6% of the population) and smaller Lutheran (2.2%), Orthodox (0.1%) and Jewish (0.1%) minorities. However, these census figures are representative of religious affiliation rather than attendance; around 12% of Hungarians attend religious services more than least once a week and around 50% more than once a year, while 30% of Hungarians do not believe in God at all. The census showed a large drop of religious adherents who wish to answer, from 74.6% to 54.7% in ten years' time, replacing them by people either who do not wish answer or people who are not following a religion.\n\nLargest cities",

Major territorial changes made Hungary ethnically homogeneous after World War I.

These annexations were affirmed under the Munich Agreement (1938), two Vienna Awards (1938 and 1940), Carpathian Ruthenia and parts of Yugoslavia were occupied and annexed in 1939 and 1941, respectively.\nThe population of Northern Transylvania, according to the Hungarian census from 1941 counted 53.5% Hungarians and 39.1% Romanians.Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 116-153 [https://books.google.com/books?id\n-zZ_NVM9mNEC&pgPA120&dq\nNorthern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&hlen&ei\nFQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&saX&oi\nbook_result&ctresult&resnum\n10&ved0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v\nonepage&q1941%20census%20data&f\nfalse]\nThe territory of Bácska had 789,705 inhabitants, and 45,4% or 47,2% declared themselves to be Hungarian native speakers or ethnic Hungarians.\nThe percentage of Hungarian speakers was 84% in southern Czechoslovakia and 15% in the Sub-Carpathian Rus.\n\nAfter WW II: 1949–1990\n\nAfter World War II, about 200,000 Germans were deported to Germany according to the decree of the Potsdam Conference. Under the forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary. After these population movements Hungary became an ethnically almost homogeneous country except the rapidly growing number of Romani people in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nFor historical reasons, significant Hungarian minority populations can be found in the surrounding countries, notably in Ukraine (in Transcarpathia), Slovakia, Romania (in Transylvania), and Serbia (in Vojvodina). Austria (in Burgenland), Croatia, and Slovenia (Prekmurje) are also host to a number of ethnic Hungarians.\n\n2001–2011\n\n*Note: In 2001 570,537, in 2011 1,455,883 people did not give answer for ethnicity. Percentages calculated excluding these people. Moreover, people were able to give more than one answer on the question asking for the minorities (for example, people were allowed to write Hungarian as their nationality and German as a nationality being influenced by), hence the sum of the above exceeds the number of population.\n*Methodology had changed in 2001 and 2011 also, so ethnicity results of the censuses are not comparable very well.\n\nHistorical ethnic groups of Hungary\n\nWhen the Hungarians invaded the Carpathian Basin, it was inhabited by West Slavic and Avar peoples. Written sources from the 9th century also suggest that some groups of Onogurs and Bulgars occupied the valley of the river Mureş at the time of the Magyars’ invasion. There is a dispute as to whether Romanian population existed in Transylvania during that time.\n\nThe Roma minority\n\nThe Romani people arrived in Hungary in the fifteenth century from Turkey.Huping Ling, Emerging voices: experiences of underrepresented Asian Americans, Rutgers University Press, 2008, p. 111 [https://books.google.com/books?idEJfrLhHyjM8C&pg\nPA111&dqRoma+people+16th+hungary&hl\nen&eiuMIbTca2IcqKhQekjbW3Dg&sa\nX&oibook_result&ct\nresult&resnum10&ved\n0CFEQ6AEwCQ#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] Nowadays, the real number of Roma in Hungary is a disputed question. In the 2001 census only 190 046 (2%) called themselves Roma, but experts and Roma organisations estimate that there are between 450,000 and 1,000,000 Roma living in Hungary.[http://www.demos.hu/Audit Stratégiai Audit 2005 - DEMOS Magyarország].

Based on current demographic trends, a 2006 estimate by Central European Management Intelligence claims that the proportion of the Roma population will double by 2050, putting the percentage of its Roma community at around 14-15% of the country's population.\n\nThere are problems related to the Roma minority in Hungary, and the very subject is a heated and disputed topic.\n\nObjective problems:\n* Slightly more than 80% of Roma children complete primary education, but only one third continue studies into the intermediate (secondary) level. This is far lower than the more than 90% proportion of children of non-Roma families who continue studies at an intermediate level. Less than 1% of Roma hold higher educational certificates.\n* Poverty: most of the Roma people live in significantly worse conditions than others.\n* Bad health conditions: life expectancy is about 10 years less compared to non-Romas\n* Lack of debate regarding the subject: academic researchers and members of the mainstream press disregard any critics and study the subject in the canonical viewpoint. Critics don't have the funds necessary to perform alternative studies.\n\nKabars\n\nThree Kabar tribes joined to the Hungarians and participated in the Hungarian conquest of Hungary. They settled mostly in Bihar county.\n\nBöszörménys\n\nThe Muslim Böszörménys migrated to the Carpathian Basin in the course of the 10th-12th centuries and they were composed of various ethnic groups.

The city of Ózd got its name after them.\n\nJassics\n\nThe Jassic (Jász in Hungarian) people were a nomadic tribe which settled -with the Cumans- in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 13th century. Their name is almost certainly related to that of the Iazyges. Béla IV, king of Hungary granted them asylum and they became a privileged community with the right of self-government. During the centuries they were fully assimilated to the Hungarian population, their language disappeared, but they preserved their Jassic identity and their regional autonomy until 1876. Over a dozen settlements in Central Hungary (e.g. Jászberény, Jászárokszállás, Jászfényszaru) still bear their name.\n\nCumans\n\nDuring the Russian campaign, the Mongols drove some 200,000 Cumans, a nomadic tribe who had opposed them, west of the Carpathian Mountains. There, the Cumans appealed to King Béla IV of Hungary for protection.[http://www.historynet.com/mongol-invasions-battle-of-liegnitz.htm Mongol Invasions: Battle of Liegnitz], HistoryNet In the Kingdom of Hungary, Cumans created two regions named Cumania (Kunság in Hungarian): Greater Cumania (Nagykunság) and Little Cumania (Kiskunság), both located the Great Hungarian Plain. Here, the Cumans maintained their autonomy, language and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. According to  Pálóczi's estimation originally 70-80,000 Cumans settled in Hungary.\n\nRomanians\n\nThe oldest extant documents from Transylvania make reference to Vlachs too.

There are different estimations in connection with number of Romanians in Kingdom of Hungary. According to researches based on place-names, 511 villages of Transylvania and Banat appear in documents at the end of the 13th century, however only 3 of them bore Romanian names. Around 1400 AD, Transylvania and Banat consisted of 1757 villages, though only 76 (4.3%) of them were Romanian.Louis L.

In 1600 the Romanian inhabitants were primarily peasants, comprising more than 60 percent of the population. By 1700, the Romanian ethnic group consisted of 40 percent of the Transylvanian population and their number raised even more in the 18th century.

After WWII a major population exchange with Czechoslovakia was carried out: about 73,000 Slovaks were transferred to Slovakia, replaced by an incomparable number of Hungarians.Janusz Bugajski, [https://books.google.com/books?idm_AcqFSfvzAC&dq\nkadar+hungary+magyarization&source=gbs_navlinks_s Ethnic politics in Eastern Europe: a guide to nationality policies, organizations, and parties] M.E. Sharpe, 1995, p. 402\n\nSerbs\n\nFrom the 14th century, escaping from the Ottoman threat, a large number of Serbs migrated to the Hungarian Kingdom. After the Battle of Mohács, most of the territory of Hungary got into Ottoman rule. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic immigrants settled in Hungary. Most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were South Slavs (the Janissary). After the Turkish withdrawal, Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg rule, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area around 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg-Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in Hungary.\n\nGermans\n\nThree waves of German migration can be distinguished in Hungary before the 20th century. The first two waves of settlers arrived to the Hungarian Kingdom in the Middle Ages (11th and 13th centuries) in Upper Hungary and in Southern Transylvania (Transylvanian Saxons).\n\nThe third, largest wave of German-speaking immigrants into Hungary occurred after the withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire from Hungarian territory, after the Treaty of Karlowitz. Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers immigrated to the regions of Southern Hungary, mostly region of Bánát, Bács-Bodrog, Baranya and Tolna counties (as well as into present-day Romania and Yugoslavia), which had been depopulated by the Ottoman wars. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents (collectively known as Danube Swabians). In 2011, 131,951 people declared to be German in Hungary (1,6%).[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/eng/volumes/18/tables/load1_30_1.html \"18. Demographic data\" – Hungarian Central Statistical Office] \n\nRusyns\n\nRusyns had lived mostly in Carpathian Ruthenia, Northeast Hungary, however significant Rusyn population appeared in Vojvodina from the 18th century.\n\nCroats\n\nCroatia was in personal union with Hungary from 1102. Croat communities were spread mostly in the western and southern part of the country and along the Danube, including Budapest.\n\nPoles\n\nThe Poles lived at the northern borders of Kingdom of Hungary from the arrival of the Hungarians.\n\nSlovenes\n\nThe Slovenes (Vendek in Hungarian) lived in the western part of the Carpathian basin before the Hungarian conquest. In the 11th and 12th century, the current linguistic and ethnic border between the Hungarian and Slovene people was established. Nowadays, they live in Vendvidék (Slovenska krajina in Slovenians) between the Mura and the Rába rivers. In 2001, there were around 5,000 Slovenes in Hungary.\n\nJews\n\nThe first historical document about Jews of Hungary is the letter written about 960 to King Joseph of the Khazars by Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the Jewish statesman of Córdoba, in which he says Jews living in \"the country of Hungarin\". There are Jewish inscriptions on tombs and monuments in Pannonia (Roman Hungary) dated to the second or third century CE.\n\nArmenians\n\nThe first Armenians came to Hungary from the Balkans in the 10 - 11th century.\n\nGreeks\n\nGreeks migrated to Kingdom of Hungary from the 15th and 16th centuries. Mass migrations did not occur until the 17th century, the largest waves being in 1718 and 1760–1770; they were primarily connected to the economic conditions of the period. It is estimated that 10,000 Greeks emigrated to Hungary in the second half of the 18th century. A number of Greeks Communists escaped to Hungary \nafter the Greek Civil War, notably in the 'Greek' village of Beloiannisz.\n\nBulgarians\n\nThe town of Szentendre and the surrounding villages were inhabited by Bulgarians since the Middle Ages. However, present day Bulgarians are largely descended from gardeners who migrated to Hungary from the 18th century.\n\nReligion\n\nThe majority of Hungarians became Christian in the 11th century. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the Reformation took place and, as a result, first Lutheranism, then soon afterwards Calvinism, became the religion of almost the entire population.\nIn the second half of the 16th century, however, Jesuits led a successful campaign of counterreformation among the Hungarians, although Protestantism survived as the faith of a significant minority. Orthodox Christianity in Hungary has been the religion mainly of some national minorities in the country, notably Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs.\n\nFaith Church, one of Europe's largest Pentecostal churches, is also located in Hungary. Hungary has historically been home to a significant Jewish community.\n\nAccording to 2011 census data, Christianity is the largest religion in Hungary, with around 5.2 million adherents (52.9%), while the largest denomination in Hungary is Catholicism (38.9% — Roman Catholicism 37.1%; Greek Catholicism 1.8%). There is a significant Calvinist minority (11.6% of the population) and smaller Lutheran (2.2%), Orthodox (0.1%) and Jewish (0.1%) minorities. However, these census figures are representative of religious affiliation rather than attendance; around 12% of Hungarians attend religious services more than least once a week and around 50% more than once a year, while 30% of Hungarians do not believe in God at all. The census showed a large drop of religious adherents who wish to answer, from 74.6% to 54.7% in ten years' time, replacing them by people either who do not wish answer or people who are not following a religion.\n\nLargest cities.
