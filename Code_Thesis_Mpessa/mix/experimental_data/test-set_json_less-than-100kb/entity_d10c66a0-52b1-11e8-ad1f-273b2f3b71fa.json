  "textBody" : "In literary criticism, a Bildungsroman (; Bildung, meaning \"education,\" and Roman, meaning \"novel\"; English: novel of formation, education, culture; coming-of-age story) is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is extremely important.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe term was coined in 1819 by philologist Karl Morgenstern in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by Wilhelm Dilthey, who legitimized it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905. The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. The term coming-of-age novel is sometimes used interchangeably with Bildungsroman, but its use is usually wider and less technical.\n\nThe birth of the Bildungsroman is normally dated to the publication of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship by Johann Wolfgang Goethe in 1795–96, or, sometimes, to Christoph Martin Wieland's Geschichte des Agathon of 1767.Swales, Martin. The German Bildungsroman from Wieland to Hesse. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978. 38. Although the Bildungsroman arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle translated Goethe’s novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.Buckley, J. H. (1974) Season of Youth: the Bildungsroman from Dickens to Golding, Harvard Univ Pr. Ellis, L. (1999) Appearing to Diminish: Female Development and the British Bildungsroman, 1750-1850,  Bucknell University Press, London  In the 20th century, it spread to Germany, Britain,Stein, M., \"The Black British Bildungsroman and the Transformation of Britain: Connectedness across Difference\" in Barbara Korte, Klaus Peter Müller, editors (1998) Unity in Diversity Revisited?: British Literature and Culture in the 1990s, pp. 89–105, Gunter Narr Verlag, Tübingen  France,Franco Moretti, Albert Sbragia (1987) The Way of the World : the Bildungsroman in European Culture, Verso, London Marianne Hirsch, [http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2349/papers/Novel%20of%20Formation%20as%20Genre.pdf \"The Novel of Formation as Genre: Between Great Expectations and Lost Illusions\"], Genre Vol. 12 (Fall 1979) pp. 293–311, University of Oklahoma and several other countries around the globe.Slaughter, J. R. (2006) \"Novel Subjects and Enabling Fictions: the Formal Articulation of International Human Rights Law\",  Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law, Ch. 2 (2007) Fordham University Press, New York ;  \n\nThe genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form, the coming-of-age film.\n\nPlot outline\n\nA Bildungsroman relates the growing up or \"coming of age\" of a sensitive person who goes in search of answers to life's questions with the expectation that these will result in gaining experience of the world. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a dunce or youngest child going out in the world to seek their fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his/her journey. In a Bildungsroman, the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society—the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of Bildungsroman that focus on the growth of an individual. An Entwicklungsroman (\"development novel\") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An Erziehungsroman (\"education novel\") focuses on training and formal schooling, while a Künstlerroman (\"artist novel\") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self. Furthermore, some memoirs and published journals can be regarded as Bildungsroman although being predominantly factual (an example being The Motorcycle Diaries by Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara).\"[http://www.realteachertutors.com.au/motorcycle-diaries-che-guevara-hsc-english-discovery/ The Motorcycle Diaries by Che Guevara–HSC English Discovery]\", Real Teacher Tutors.
