  "textBody" : "Dean Ray Koontz (born July 9, 1945) is an American author. His novels are broadly described as suspense thrillers, but also frequently incorporate elements of horror, fantasy, science fiction, mystery, and satire. Many of his books have appeared on The New York Times Bestseller List, with 14 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks reaching the number-one position. Koontz wrote under a number of pen names earlier in his career, including \"David Axton\", \"Leigh Nichols\", and \"Brian Coffey\".\nHe has sold over 450 million copies of his work as reported on his official website.\n\nEarly life\n\nKoontz was born on July 9, 1945, in Everett, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence (née Logue) and Raymond Koontz.[https://archive.is/20130208224509/http://www.veinotte.com/koontz/bio.htm]\n   He has said that he was regularly beaten and abused by his alcoholic father, which influenced his later writing, as also did the courage of his physically diminutive mother in standing up to her husband.  In his senior year at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, he won a fiction competition sponsored by Atlantic Monthly magazine.Piazza, Judyth: [http://staugnews.com/2009/07/27/judyth-piazza-chats-with-dean-koontz-and-mark-constant-the-market-on-granada.html \"Judyth Piazza chats with Dean Koontz and Mark Constant, The Market on Granada\"]  St. Augustine News, July 27, 2009 After graduation in 1967, he went to work as an English teacher at Mechanicsburg High School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, Koontz worked for the Appalachian Poverty Program, a federally funded initiative designed to help poor children. In a 1996 interview with Reason Magazine, he said that while the program sounded \"very noble and wonderful, . . . [i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children.. . and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'\" This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, The Dean Koontz Companion, he recalled that he:\n\nrealized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.\"\n\nCareer\n\nIn his spare time, he wrote his first novel, Star Quest, which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen science-fiction novels. Seeing the Catholic faith as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its \"intellectual rigor\" and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.Rossi, Tony, [http://catholicexchange.com/2009/08/01/120925/ Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels] Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009 He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert G.K. Chesterton did: that it encourages a \"joy about the gift of life\". Koontz says that spirituality has always been part of his books, as are grace and our struggle as fallen souls, but he \"never get[s] on a soapbox\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Koontz began writing suspense and horror fiction, both under his own name and several pseudonyms, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several editors convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different genres invariably fell victim to \"negative crossover\" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the \"Mike Tucker\" trilogy [Blood Risk, Surrounded, Wall of Masks] in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of Richard Stark (Donald E. Westlake). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared - Demon Seed and Invasion were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and Prison of Ice had certain sections bowdlerised.\n\nAfter writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was Whispers, published in 1980. The two books before that, The Key to Midnight and The Funhouse, also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was Demon Seed, the sales of which picked up after the release of the film of the same name in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year. His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book Strangers.\nSince then, 12 hardcovers and 13 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on The New York Times Bestseller List.\n\nBestselling science-fiction writer Brian Herbert has stated, \"I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.\"\n\nIn 1997, psychologist Katherine Ramsland published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him. This \"psychobiography\" (as Ramsland called it) often showed the conception of Koontz's characters and plots from events in his own life.\n\nEarly author photos on the back of many of his novels show a balding Koontz with a mustache. After Koontz underwent hair transplantation surgery in the late 1990s, his subsequent books have featured a new, clean-shaven appearance with a fuller head of hair. Koontz explained the change by claiming that he was tired of looking like G. Gordon Liddy. \n\nMany of his novels are set in and around Orange County, California. As of 2006, he lives there with his wife, Gerda (Cerra), in Newport Coast, California, behind the gates of Pelican Hills. In 2008, he was the world's sixth-most highly paid author, tied with John Grisham, at $25 million annually.\n\nOther inspiration \n\nOne of Dean Koontz's pen names was inspired by his dog, Trixie Koontz, a Golden Retriever, shown in many of his book-jacket photos. Trixie originally was a service dog with Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), a charitable organization that provides service dogs for people with disabilities. Trixie was a gift from CCI in gratitude of Koontz's substantial donations, totaling $2,500,000 between 1991 and 2004. Koontz was taken with the charity while he was researching his novel Midnight, a book which included a CCI-trained dog, a black Labrador Retriever, named Moose.\nIn 2004, Koontz wrote and edited Life Is Good: Lessons in Joyful Living in her name, and in 2005, Koontz wrote a second book credited to Trixie, Christmas Is Good. Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The royalties of the books were donated to CCI. In 2007, Trixie contracted terminal cancer that created a tumor in her heart. The Koontzes had her put to sleep outside their family home on June 30. After Trixie's death, Koontz has continued writing on his website under Trixie's names in \"TOTOS\", standing for Trixie on the Other Side.\nTrixie is widely thought to have been his inspiration for his November 2007 book, The Darkest Evening of the Year, about a woman who runs a Golden Retriever rescue home, and who rescues a 'special' dog, named Nickie, which eventually saves her life. In August 2009, Koontz published A Big Little Life, a memoir of his life with Trixie.\n\nIn October 2008, Koontz revealed that he had adopted a new dog, Anna. Eventually, he learned that Anna was the grandniece of Trixie. Anna died on May 22, 2016. Koontz then adopted a new dog, Elsa, on July 11, 2016.\n\nDisputed authorship \n\nA number of letters, articles, and novels were ostensibly written by Koontz during the 1960s and 1970s, but he has stated he did not write them. These include 30 erotic novels, allegedly written together by Koontz and his wife Gerda, including books such as Thirteen and Ready!, Swappers Convention, and Hung, the last one published under the name \"Leonard Chris\". They also include contributions to the fanzines Energumen and BeABohema in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including articles that mention the erotic novels,BeABohehma #8, 1970, ed. Frank Lunney; page 5 such as a movie column called \"Way Station\" in BeABohema.\n\nKoontz wrote in How to Write Best Selling Fiction (a much revised and updated version of 'Writing Popular Fiction' (1972)) (Writer's Digest Books, 1981, pp18) \"During my first six years as a full-time novelist {..} I wrote a lot of ephemeral stuff; anything that would pay some bills {..} I did Gothic romance novels under a pen-name {..}  Like many writers, I did some pornography too, and a variety of other things, none of which required me to commit my heart or my soul to the task.  (This is not to say I didn't bother to do a good job; on the contrary, I never wrote down to any market, and I always tried to give my editors and readers their money's worth.)\"  The Gothic novels are identifiable but none of Koontz's acknowledged work fits into the latter category.\n\nKoontz has stated on his website  that he used only the 10 known pen names and \"there are no secret pen names used by Dean\"; he adds that his own identity was stolen by \"a person he had previously worked with professionally\", who submitted letters and some articles to fanzines under Koontz's name between 1969 and at least the early 1970s. Koontz has stated that he was only made aware of these bogus letters and articles in 1991 in a written admission from the identity thief. He has stated that he will reveal this person's name in his memoirs.\n\nBibliography \n\nScreenplays \n\n* 1979 – CHiPs episode 306: \"Counterfeit\" (as Brian Coffey)\n* 1998 – \"Phantoms\"\n* 2005 – \"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein\"\n\nFilm adaptations\n\nUpcoming\n\n* Frankenstein (TBA)\n* The Husband (TBA) – Focus Features\n\nReleased\n\n* Odd Thomas (2013) – starring Anton Yelchin\n* Frankenstein (2004) – USA Network – starring Adam Goldberg, Parker Posey, Michael Madsen, Vincent Perez, and Thomas Kretschmann (Koontz pulled out of the project midway through production because he did not like the direction the film was headed.
