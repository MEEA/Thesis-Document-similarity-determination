The Maclaurin series, a special case of the Taylor series, is named after him.\n\nOwing to changes in orthography since that time (his name was originally rendered as “M‘Laurine”[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Maclaurin_EMS_notes.html \"Colin Maclaurin: A Biographical Note\" by Robin Schlapp (6 December 1946)]. (Note that the quotation in [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Turnbull_Maclaurin_1.html] has been altered.)), his surname is alternatively written MacLaurin.\n\nEarly life\n\nMaclaurin was born in Kilmodan, Argyll. His father, Reverend and Minister of Glendaruel John Maclaurin, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother died before he reached nine years of age. He was then educated under the care of his uncle, the Reverend Daniel Maclaurin, minister of Kilfinan.\n\nAcademic career\n\nAt eleven, Maclaurin entered the University of Glasgow. He graduated MA three years later by defending a thesis on the Power of Gravity, and remained at Glasgow to study divinity until he was 19, when he was elected professor of mathematics in a ten-day competition at the Marischal College in the University of Aberdeen. This record as the world's youngest professor endured until March 2008, when the record was officially given to Alia Sabur.\n\nIn the vacations of 1719 and 1721, Maclaurin went to London, where he became acquainted with Sir Isaac Newton, Dr Benjamin Hoadly, Samuel Clarke, Martin Folkes, and other philosophers. He was admitted a member of the Royal Society.\n\nIn 1722, having provided a substitute for his class at Aberdeen, he travelled on the Continent as tutor to George Hume, the son of Alexander Hume, 2nd Earl of Marchmont. During their time in Lorraine, he wrote his essay on the percussion of bodies (Demonstration des loix du choc des corps), which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1724. Upon the death of his pupil at Montpellier, Maclaurin returned to Aberdeen.\n\nIn 1725, Maclaurin was appointed deputy to the mathematical professor at Edinburgh, James Gregory (brother of David Gregory and nephew of the esteemed James Gregory), upon the recommendation of Isaac Newton. On 3 November of that year Maclaurin succeeded Gregory, and went on to raise the character of that university as a school of science. Newton was so impressed with Maclaurin that he had offered to pay his salary himself.\n\nContributions to mathematics\n\nMaclaurin used Taylor series to characterize maxima, minima, and points of inflection for infinitely differentiable functions in his Treatise of Fluxions. Maclaurin attributed the series to Taylor, though the series was known before to Newton and Gregory, and in special cases to Madhava of Sangamagrama in fourteenth century India.\nNevertheless, Maclaurin received credit for his use of the series, and the Taylor series expanded around 0 is sometimes known as the Maclaurin series .\n\nMaclaurin also made significant contributions to the gravitation attraction of ellipsoids, a subject that furthermore attracted the attention of d'Alembert, A.-C. Clairaut, Euler, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson and Gauss.  Maclaurin showed that an oblate spheroid was a possible equilibrium in Newton's theory of gravity.  The subject continues to be of scientific interest, and Nobel Laureate Subramanyan Chandrasekhar dedicated a chapter of his book Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium to Maclaurin spheroids. \n\nIndependently from Euler and using the same methods, Maclaurin discovered the Euler–Maclaurin formula.  He used it to sum powers of arithmetic progressions, derive Stirling's formula, and to derive the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formulas which includes Simpson's rule as a special case. \n\nMaclaurin contributed to the study of elliptic integrals, reducing many intractable integrals to problems of finding arcs for hyperbolas.  His work was continued by d'Alembert and Euler, who gave a more concise approach.\n\nIn his Treatise of Algebra (Ch. XII, Sect 86), published in 1748 two years after his death, Maclaurin proved a rule for solving square linear systems in the cases of 2 and 3 unknowns, and discussed the case of 4 unknowns.\n  This publication preceded by two years Cramer's publication of a generalization of the rule to n unknowns, now commonly known as Cramer's rule.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1733, Maclaurin married Anne Stewart, the daughter of Walter Stewart, the Solicitor General for Scotland, by whom he had seven children. His eldest son John Maclaurin studied Law, was a Senator of the College of Justice, and became Lord Dreghorn; he was also joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nMaclaurin actively opposed the Jacobite rising of 1745 and superintended the operations necessary for the defence of Edinburgh against the Highland army. Maclaurin compiled a diary of his exertions against the Jacobites, both within and without the city.  When the Highland army entered the city, however, he fled to York, where he was invited to stay by the Archbishop of York.\n\nOn his journey south, Maclaurin fell from his horse, and the fatigue, anxiety, and cold to which he was exposed on that occasion laid the foundations of dropsy. He returned to Edinburgh after the Jacobite army marched south, but died soon after his return.\n\nHe is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.\n\nMathematician and former MIT President Richard Cockburn Maclaurin was from the same family.\n\nThe Maclaurin Society (MacSoc), the Mathematics and Statistics Society at Glasgow University, is named in his honour.\n\nColin MacLaurin Road within Edinburgh University's King's Buildings complex is named in his honour.\n\nNotable works\n\nSome of his important works are:\n\n*Geometria Organica - 1720\n*De Linearum Geometricarum Proprietatibus - 1720\n*Treatise on Fluxions - 1742 (763 pages in two volumes.
