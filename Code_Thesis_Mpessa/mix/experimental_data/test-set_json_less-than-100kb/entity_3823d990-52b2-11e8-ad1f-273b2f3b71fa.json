They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, closely related to the Sinhalese and having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.\n\nIn the past there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll). This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.\n\nLanguages\n\nDhivehi,  an Indo-Aryan language having some similarities with Elu, the ancient Sinhalese language and written in a specialized Arabic script (Tāna), is the official language and is spoken by virtually the whole population.
