Harmonic oscillators occur widely in nature and are exploited in many manmade devices, such as clocks and radio circuits.  They are the source of virtually all sinusoidal vibrations and waves.\n\nSimple harmonic oscillator \n\nA simple harmonic oscillator is an oscillator that is neither driven nor damped. It consists of a mass m, which experiences a single force, F, which pulls the mass in the direction of the point x=0 and depends only on the mass's position x and a constant k. Balance of forces (Newton's second law) for the system is\n\nF m a \n m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} m\\ddot{x} \n -k x. \n\nSolving this differential equation, we find that the motion is described by the function\n\n x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t+\\varphi), \n\nwhere\n\n\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac k m} \n \\frac{2\\pi} T.\n\nThe motion is periodic, repeating itself in a sinusoidal fashion with constant amplitude, A. In addition to its amplitude, the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator is characterized by its period T, the time for a single oscillation or its frequency f = , the number of cycles per unit time. The position at a given time t also depends on the phase, φ, which determines the starting point on the sine wave. The period and frequency are determined by the size of the mass m and the force constant k, while the amplitude and phase are determined by the starting position and velocity.\n\nThe velocity and acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator oscillate with the same frequency as the position but with shifted phases.  The velocity is maximum for zero displacement, while the acceleration is in the direction opposite to the displacement.\n\nThe potential energy stored in a simple harmonic oscillator at position x is\n\nU = \\frac 1 2 kx^2.\n\nDamped harmonic oscillator \n\nIn real oscillators, friction, or damping, slows the motion of the system. Due to frictional force, the velocity decreases in proportion to the acting frictional force. While simple harmonic motion oscillates with only the restoring force acting on the system, damped harmonic motion experiences friction. In many vibrating systems the frictional force Ff can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity v of the object: , where c is called the viscous damping coefficient.\n\nBalance of forces (Newton's second law) for damped harmonic oscillators is then\n\n F F_\\text{ext} - kx - c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}.\n\nWhen no external forces are present (i.e. when F_\\text{ext}=0), this can be rewritten into the form\n\n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^{\\,2} x = 0, \n\nwhere\n\n\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac k m} is called the 'undamped angular frequency of the oscillator' and\n\n\\zeta = \\frac c {2 \\sqrt{mk}} is called the 'damping ratio'.\n\nThe value of the damping ratio ζ critically determines the behavior of the system. A damped harmonic oscillator can be:\n*Overdamped (ζ > 1): The system returns (exponentially decays) to steady state without oscillating.  Larger values of the damping ratio ζ return to equilibrium more slowly.\n*Critically damped (ζ = 1):  The system returns to steady state as quickly as possible without oscillating (although overshoot can occur).  This is often desired for the damping of systems such as doors.\n*Underdamped (ζ \\omega_1 \\omega_0\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}, the exponential decay of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by \\lambda \n \\omega_0\\zeta.\n\nThe Q factor of a damped oscillator is defined as \nQ = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\text{energy stored}}{\\text{energy lost per cycle}}.\n\nQ is related to the damping ratio by the equation Q = \\frac 1 {2\\zeta}.\n\nDriven harmonic oscillators \n \n\nDriven harmonic oscillators are damped oscillators further affected by an externally applied force F(t).\n\nNewton's second law takes the form\n\nF(t)-kx-c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}=m\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}. \n\nIt is usually rewritten into the form\n\n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 x = \\frac{F(t)}{m}. \n\nThis equation can be solved exactly for any driving force, using the solutions z(t) which satisfy the unforced equation:\n\n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2z}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 z = 0,\n\nand which can be expressed as damped sinusoidal oscillations,\n\nz(t) = A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta \\omega_0 t} \\ \\sin \\left( \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\ \\omega_0 t + \\varphi \\right), \n\nin the case where ζ ≤ 1.

In physics, the adaptation is called relaxation, and τ is called the relaxation time.\n\nIn electrical engineering, a multiple of τ is called the settling time, i.e. the time necessary to ensure the signal is within a fixed departure from final value, typically within 10%. The term overshoot refers to the extent the maximum response exceeds final value, and undershoot refers to the extent the response falls below final value for times following the maximum response.\n\nSinusoidal driving force\n\nIn the case of a sinusoidal driving force:\n\n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 x = \\frac{1}{m} F_0 \\sin(\\omega t),\n\nwhere \\,\\!F_0 is the driving amplitude and \\,\\!\\omega is the driving frequency for a sinusoidal driving mechanism. This type of system appears in AC driven RLC circuits (resistor-inductor-capacitor) and driven spring systems having internal mechanical resistance or external air resistance.\n\nThe general solution is a sum of a transient solution that depends on initial conditions, and a steady state that is independent of initial conditions and depends only on the driving amplitude \\,\\!F_0, driving frequency, \\,\\!\\omega, undamped angular frequency \\,\\!\\omega_0, and the damping ratio \\,\\!\\zeta.\n\nThe steady-state solution is proportional to the driving force with an induced phase change of \\,\\!\\varphi:\n\n x(t) = \\frac{F_0}{m Z_m \\omega} \\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)\n\nwhere\n\n Z_m = \\sqrt{\\left(2\\omega_0\\zeta\\right)^2 + \\frac 1 {\\omega^2} (\\omega_0^2  - \\omega^2)^2}\nis the absolute value of the impedance or linear response function and\n\n \\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\omega \\omega_0\\zeta}{\\omega^2-\\omega_0^2} \\right)+n\\pi\n\nis the phase of the oscillation relative to the driving force. The phase value is usually taken to be between -180 degrees and 0 (that is, it represents a phase lag, for both positive and negative values of the arctan's argument).\n\nFor a particular driving frequency called the resonance, or resonant frequency \\,\\!\\omega_r = \\omega_0\\sqrt{1-2\\zeta^2}, the amplitude (for a given \\,\\!F_0) is maximum. This resonance effect only occurs when \\,\\zeta , i.e. for significantly underdamped systems. For strongly underdamped systems the value of the amplitude can become quite large near the resonance frequency.\n\nThe transient solutions are the same as the unforced (\\,\\!F_0 = 0) damped harmonic oscillator and represent the systems response to other events that occurred previously.  The transient solutions typically die out rapidly enough that they can be ignored.\n\nParametric oscillators \n\nA parametric oscillator is a driven harmonic oscillator in which the drive energy is provided by varying the parameters of the oscillator, such as the damping or restoring force.\nA familiar example of parametric oscillation is \"pumping\" on a playground swing.\nA person on a moving swing can increase the amplitude of the swing's oscillations without any external drive force (pushes) being applied, by changing the moment of inertia of the swing by rocking back and forth (\"pumping\") or alternately standing and squatting, in rhythm with the swing's oscillations.  The varying of the parameters drives the system.  Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency \\omega and damping \\beta.\n\nParametric oscillators are used in many applications.  The classical varactor parametric oscillator oscillates when the diode's capacitance is varied periodically.  The circuit that varies the diode's capacitance is called the \"pump\" or \"driver\".   In microwave electronics, waveguide/YAG based parametric oscillators operate in the same fashion. The designer varies a parameter periodically to induce oscillations.\n\nParametric oscillators have been developed as low-noise amplifiers, especially in the radio and microwave frequency range.  Thermal noise is minimal, since a reactance (not a resistance) is varied.  Another common use is frequency conversion, e.g., conversion from audio to radio frequencies.  For example, the Optical parametric oscillator converts an input laser wave into two output waves of lower frequency (\\omega_s, \\omega_i).\n\nParametric resonance occurs in a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing, since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter. This effect is different from regular resonance because it exhibits the instability phenomenon.\n\nUniversal oscillator equation\n\nThe equation \n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2q}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q = 0\n\nis known as the universal oscillator equation since all second order linear oscillatory systems can be reduced to this form. This is done through nondimensionalization.\n\nIf the forcing function is f(t)  cos(ωt) \n cos(ωtcτ)  cos(ωτ), where ω \n ωtc, the equation becomes\n\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2q}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q = \\cos(\\omega \\tau).\n\nThe solution to this differential equation contains two parts, the \"transient\" and the \"steady state\".\n\nTransient solution \n\nThe solution based on solving the ordinary differential equation is for arbitrary constants c1 and c2\n\nq_t (\\tau) \\begin{cases} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta\\tau} \\left( c_1 \\mathrm{e}^{\\tau \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}} + c_2 \\mathrm{e}^{- \\tau \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}} \\right) & \\zeta > 1 \\text{ (overdamping)} \\\\ \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta\\tau} (c_1+c_2 \\tau) \n \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}(c_1+c_2 \\tau) & \\zeta = 1 \\text{ (critical damping)} \\\\ \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta \\tau} \\left[ c_1 \\cos \\left(\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\tau\\right) +c_2 \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\tau\\right) \\right] & \\zeta \n\nThe transient solution is independent of the forcing function.\n\nSteady-state solution \n\nApply the \"complex variables method\" by solving the auxiliary equation below and then finding the real part of its solution:\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q \\cos(\\omega \\tau) + \\mathrm{i}\\sin(\\omega \\tau) \n \\mathrm{e}^{ \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau} .\n\nSupposing the solution is of the form\n\n\\,\\! q_s(\\tau) = A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) } . \n\nIts derivatives from zero to 2nd order are\nq_s A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) }, \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} \n \\mathrm{i} \\omega A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) }, \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} = - \\omega^2 A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) } .\n\nSubstituting these quantities into the differential equation gives\n\n\\,\\! -\\omega^2 A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} (\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} + A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} (-\\omega^2 A + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A + A) \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} (\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} \n \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau} .\n\nDividing by the exponential term on the left results in\n\n\\,\\! -\\omega^2 A + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A + A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} \\varphi} \n \\cos\\varphi - \\mathrm{i} \\sin\\varphi . \n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts results in two independent equations\nA (1-\\omega^2)\\cos\\varphi \\qquad 2 \\zeta \\omega A \n - \\sin\\varphi.\n\nAmplitude part \n\nSquaring both equations and adding them together gives\n\n\\left . \\begin{array}{rcl} A^2  (1-\\omega^2)^2 & & \\cos^2\\varphi \\\\[6pt] (2 \\zeta \\omega A)^2 & \n & \\sin^2\\varphi \\end{array} \\right \\} \\Rightarrow A^2[(1-\\omega^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\omega)^2] = 1. \n\nTherefore,\n\nA A( \\zeta, \\omega) \n \\operatorname{sign} \\left( \\frac{-\\sin\\varphi}{2 \\zeta \\omega} \\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-\\omega^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\omega)^2}}.\n\nCompare this result with the theory section on resonance, as well as the \"magnitude part\" of the RLC circuit.

Below is a table showing analogous quantities in four harmonic oscillator systems in mechanics and electronics.  If analogous parameters on the same line in the table are given numerically equal values, the behavior of the oscillators—their output waveform, resonant frequency, damping factor, etc.—are the same.\n\nApplication to a conservative force \n\nThe problem of the simple harmonic oscillator occurs frequently in physics, because a mass at equilibrium under the influence of any conservative force, in the limit of small motions, behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator.\n\nA conservative force is one that has a potential energy function.  The potential energy function of a harmonic oscillator is:\n\nV(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\nGiven an arbitrary potential energy function V(x), one can do a Taylor expansion in terms of x around an energy minimum (x = x_0) to model the behavior of small perturbations from equilibrium.\n\nV(x) = V(x_0) + (x-x_0) V'(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3\n\nBecause V(x_0) is a minimum, the first derivative evaluated at x_0 must be zero, so the linear term drops out:\n\nV(x) = V(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3\n\nThe constant term V(x0) is arbitrary and thus may be dropped, and a coordinate transformation allows the form of the simple harmonic oscillator to be retrieved:\n\nV(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} x^2 V^{(2)}(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\nThus, given an arbitrary potential energy function V(x) with a non-vanishing second derivative, one can use the solution to the simple harmonic oscillator to provide an approximate solution for small perturbations around the equilibrium point.\n\nExamples\n\nSimple pendulum\n\nAssuming no damping, the differential equation governing a simple pendulum of length \\ell, where g is the local acceleration of gravity, is\n\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\sin\\theta=0.\n\nIf the maximum displacement of the pendulum is small, we can use the approximation \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta and instead consider the equation\n\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\theta=0.\n\nThe solution to this equation is given by:\n\n\\theta(t) = \\theta_0\\cos\\left(\\sqrt{g\\over \\ell}t\\right)\n\nwhere \\theta_0 is the largest angle attained by the pendulum.  The period, the time for one complete oscillation, is given by the expression\n\nT_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt\\frac{\\ell}{g},\n\nwhich is a good approximation of the actual period when \\theta_0 is small.\n\nSpring/mass system\n\nWhen a spring is stretched or compressed by a mass, the spring develops a restoring force. Hooke's law gives the relationship of the force exerted by the spring when the spring is compressed or stretched a certain length:\n\nF(t) =-kx(t) \n\nwhere F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement of the mass with respect to the equilibrium position. The minus sign in the equation indicates that the force exerted by the spring always acts in a direction that is opposite to the displacement (i.e. the force always acts towards the zero position), and so prevents the mass from flying off to infinity.\n\nBy using either force balance or an energy method, it can be readily shown that the motion of this system is given by the following differential equation:\n\n F(t) -kx(t) \n m \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} x(t) = ma. \n\n...the latter being Newton's second law of motion.\n\nIf the initial displacement is A, and there is no initial velocity, the solution of this equation is given by:\n\n x(t) =A \\cos \\left( \\sqrt{k \\over m} \\,\\, t \\right).\n\nGiven an ideal massless spring, m is the mass on the end of the spring. If the spring itself has mass, its effective mass must be included in m.\n\nEnergy variation in the spring–damping system\n\nIn terms of energy, all systems have two types of energy, potential energy and kinetic energy. When a spring is stretched or compressed, it stores elastic potential energy, which then is transferred into kinetic energy. The potential energy within a spring is determined by the equation  U = kx^2/ 2 . \n\nWhen the spring is stretched or compressed, kinetic energy of the mass gets converted into potential energy of the spring. By conservation of energy, assuming the datum is defined at the equilibrium position, when the spring reaches its maximum potential energy, the kinetic energy of the mass is zero. When the spring is released, it tries to return to equilibrium, and all its potential energy converts to kinetic energy of the mass.\n\nDefinition of terms",

This type of system appears in AC driven RLC circuits (resistor-inductor-capacitor) and driven spring systems having internal mechanical resistance or external air resistance.\n\nThe general solution is a sum of a transient solution that depends on initial conditions, and a steady state that is independent of initial conditions and depends only on the driving amplitude \\,\\!F_0, driving frequency, \\,\\!\\omega, undamped angular frequency \\,\\!\\omega_0, and the damping ratio \\,\\!\\zeta.\n\nThe steady-state solution is proportional to the driving force with an induced phase change of \\,\\!\\varphi:\n\n x(t) = \\frac{F_0}{m Z_m \\omega} \\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)\n\nwhere\n\n Z_m = \\sqrt{\\left(2\\omega_0\\zeta\\right)^2 + \\frac 1 {\\omega^2} (\\omega_0^2  - \\omega^2)^2}\nis the absolute value of the impedance or linear response function and\n\n \\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\omega \\omega_0\\zeta}{\\omega^2-\\omega_0^2} \\right)+n\\pi\n\nis the phase of the oscillation relative to the driving force. The phase value is usually taken to be between -180 degrees and 0 (that is, it represents a phase lag, for both positive and negative values of the arctan's argument).\n\nFor a particular driving frequency called the resonance, or resonant frequency \\,\\!\\omega_r = \\omega_0\\sqrt{1-2\\zeta^2}, the amplitude (for a given \\,\\!F_0) is maximum. This resonance effect only occurs when \\,\\zeta , i.e. for significantly underdamped systems. For strongly underdamped systems the value of the amplitude can become quite large near the resonance frequency.\n\nThe transient solutions are the same as the unforced (\\,\\!F_0 = 0) damped harmonic oscillator and represent the systems response to other events that occurred previously.  The transient solutions typically die out rapidly enough that they can be ignored.\n\nParametric oscillators \n\nA parametric oscillator is a driven harmonic oscillator in which the drive energy is provided by varying the parameters of the oscillator, such as the damping or restoring force.\nA familiar example of parametric oscillation is \"pumping\" on a playground swing.\nA person on a moving swing can increase the amplitude of the swing's oscillations without any external drive force (pushes) being applied, by changing the moment of inertia of the swing by rocking back and forth (\"pumping\") or alternately standing and squatting, in rhythm with the swing's oscillations.  The varying of the parameters drives the system.  Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency \\omega and damping \\beta.\n\nParametric oscillators are used in many applications.  The classical varactor parametric oscillator oscillates when the diode's capacitance is varied periodically.  The circuit that varies the diode's capacitance is called the \"pump\" or \"driver\".   In microwave electronics, waveguide/YAG based parametric oscillators operate in the same fashion. The designer varies a parameter periodically to induce oscillations.\n\nParametric oscillators have been developed as low-noise amplifiers, especially in the radio and microwave frequency range.  Thermal noise is minimal, since a reactance (not a resistance) is varied.  Another common use is frequency conversion, e.g., conversion from audio to radio frequencies.  For example, the Optical parametric oscillator converts an input laser wave into two output waves of lower frequency (\\omega_s, \\omega_i).\n\nParametric resonance occurs in a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing, since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter. This effect is different from regular resonance because it exhibits the instability phenomenon.\n\nUniversal oscillator equation\n\nThe equation \n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2q}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q = 0\n\nis known as the universal oscillator equation since all second order linear oscillatory systems can be reduced to this form. This is done through nondimensionalization.\n\nIf the forcing function is f(t)  cos(ωt) \n cos(ωtcτ)  cos(ωτ), where ω \n ωtc, the equation becomes\n\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2q}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q = \\cos(\\omega \\tau).\n\nThe solution to this differential equation contains two parts, the \"transient\" and the \"steady state\".\n\nTransient solution \n\nThe solution based on solving the ordinary differential equation is for arbitrary constants c1 and c2\n\nq_t (\\tau) \\begin{cases} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta\\tau} \\left( c_1 \\mathrm{e}^{\\tau \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}} + c_2 \\mathrm{e}^{- \\tau \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}} \\right) & \\zeta > 1 \\text{ (overdamping)} \\\\ \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta\\tau} (c_1+c_2 \\tau) \n \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}(c_1+c_2 \\tau) & \\zeta = 1 \\text{ (critical damping)} \\\\ \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta \\tau} \\left[ c_1 \\cos \\left(\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\tau\\right) +c_2 \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\tau\\right) \\right] & \\zeta \n\nThe transient solution is independent of the forcing function.\n\nSteady-state solution \n\nApply the \"complex variables method\" by solving the auxiliary equation below and then finding the real part of its solution:\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q \\cos(\\omega \\tau) + \\mathrm{i}\\sin(\\omega \\tau) \n \\mathrm{e}^{ \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau} .\n\nSupposing the solution is of the form\n\n\\,\\! q_s(\\tau) = A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) } . \n\nIts derivatives from zero to 2nd order are\nq_s A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) }, \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} \n \\mathrm{i} \\omega A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) }, \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} = - \\omega^2 A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} ( \\omega \\tau + \\varphi ) } .\n\nSubstituting these quantities into the differential equation gives\n\n\\,\\! -\\omega^2 A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} (\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} + A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} (-\\omega^2 A + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A + A) \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} (\\omega \\tau + \\varphi)} \n \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau} .\n\nDividing by the exponential term on the left results in\n\n\\,\\! -\\omega^2 A + 2 \\zeta \\mathrm{i} \\omega A + A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} \\varphi} \n \\cos\\varphi - \\mathrm{i} \\sin\\varphi . \n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts results in two independent equations\nA (1-\\omega^2)\\cos\\varphi \\qquad 2 \\zeta \\omega A \n - \\sin\\varphi.\n\nAmplitude part \n\nSquaring both equations and adding them together gives\n\n\\left . \\begin{array}{rcl} A^2  (1-\\omega^2)^2 & & \\cos^2\\varphi \\\\[6pt] (2 \\zeta \\omega A)^2 & \n & \\sin^2\\varphi \\end{array} \\right \\} \\Rightarrow A^2[(1-\\omega^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\omega)^2] = 1. \n\nTherefore,\n\nA A( \\zeta, \\omega) \n \\operatorname{sign} \\left( \\frac{-\\sin\\varphi}{2 \\zeta \\omega} \\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-\\omega^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\omega)^2}}.\n\nCompare this result with the theory section on resonance, as well as the \"magnitude part\" of the RLC circuit.

Below is a table showing analogous quantities in four harmonic oscillator systems in mechanics and electronics.  If analogous parameters on the same line in the table are given numerically equal values, the behavior of the oscillators—their output waveform, resonant frequency, damping factor, etc.—are the same.\n\nApplication to a conservative force \n\nThe problem of the simple harmonic oscillator occurs frequently in physics, because a mass at equilibrium under the influence of any conservative force, in the limit of small motions, behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator.\n\nA conservative force is one that has a potential energy function.  The potential energy function of a harmonic oscillator is:\n\nV(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\nGiven an arbitrary potential energy function V(x), one can do a Taylor expansion in terms of x around an energy minimum (x = x_0) to model the behavior of small perturbations from equilibrium.\n\nV(x) = V(x_0) + (x-x_0) V'(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3\n\nBecause V(x_0) is a minimum, the first derivative evaluated at x_0 must be zero, so the linear term drops out:\n\nV(x) = V(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3\n\nThe constant term V(x0) is arbitrary and thus may be dropped, and a coordinate transformation allows the form of the simple harmonic oscillator to be retrieved:\n\nV(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} x^2 V^{(2)}(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\nThus, given an arbitrary potential energy function V(x) with a non-vanishing second derivative, one can use the solution to the simple harmonic oscillator to provide an approximate solution for small perturbations around the equilibrium point.\n\nExamples\n\nSimple pendulum\n\nAssuming no damping, the differential equation governing a simple pendulum of length \\ell, where g is the local acceleration of gravity, is\n\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\sin\\theta=0.\n\nIf the maximum displacement of the pendulum is small, we can use the approximation \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta and instead consider the equation\n\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\theta=0.\n\nThe solution to this equation is given by:\n\n\\theta(t) = \\theta_0\\cos\\left(\\sqrt{g\\over \\ell}t\\right)\n\nwhere \\theta_0 is the largest angle attained by the pendulum.  The period, the time for one complete oscillation, is given by the expression\n\nT_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt\\frac{\\ell}{g},\n\nwhich is a good approximation of the actual period when \\theta_0 is small.\n\nSpring/mass system\n\nWhen a spring is stretched or compressed by a mass, the spring develops a restoring force. Hooke's law gives the relationship of the force exerted by the spring when the spring is compressed or stretched a certain length:\n\nF(t) =-kx(t) \n\nwhere F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement of the mass with respect to the equilibrium position. The minus sign in the equation indicates that the force exerted by the spring always acts in a direction that is opposite to the displacement (i.e. the force always acts towards the zero position), and so prevents the mass from flying off to infinity.\n\nBy using either force balance or an energy method, it can be readily shown that the motion of this system is given by the following differential equation:\n\n F(t) -kx(t) \n m \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} x(t) = ma. \n\n...the latter being Newton's second law of motion.\n\nIf the initial displacement is A, and there is no initial velocity, the solution of this equation is given by:\n\n x(t) =A \\cos \\left( \\sqrt{k \\over m} \\,\\, t \\right).\n\nGiven an ideal massless spring, m is the mass on the end of the spring. If the spring itself has mass, its effective mass must be included in m.\n\nEnergy variation in the spring–damping system\n\nIn terms of energy, all systems have two types of energy, potential energy and kinetic energy. When a spring is stretched or compressed, it stores elastic potential energy, which then is transferred into kinetic energy. The potential energy within a spring is determined by the equation  U = kx^2/ 2 . \n\nWhen the spring is stretched or compressed, kinetic energy of the mass gets converted into potential energy of the spring. By conservation of energy, assuming the datum is defined at the equilibrium position, when the spring reaches its maximum potential energy, the kinetic energy of the mass is zero. When the spring is released, it tries to return to equilibrium, and all its potential energy converts to kinetic energy of the mass.\n\nDefinition of terms.
