In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving \\mu \\sum x P(x).Elementary Statistics by Robert R.

Not every probability distribution has a defined mean; see the Cauchy distribution for an example.

The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted by \\bar{x}, pronounced \"x bar\". If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is termed the sample mean (denoted \\bar{x}) to distinguish it from the population mean (denoted \\mu or \\mu_x).Underhill, L.G.; Bradfield d.

The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Probability by Seymour Lipschutz and Marc Lipson, [https://books.google.com/books?idZKdqlw2ZnAMC&lpg\nPP1&pgPA141#v\nonepage&q&f=false p. 141]\n\nOutside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of \"mean\" are often used in geometry and analysis; examples are given below.\n\nTypes of mean\n\nPythagorean means\n\nArithmetic mean (AM) \n\nThe arithmetic mean (or simply \"mean\") of a sample x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n, usually denoted by \\bar{x}, is the sum of the sampled values divided by the number of items in the example\n\n \\bar{x} \\frac{1}{n}\\left (\\sum_{i\n1}^n{x_i}\\right ) = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots +x_n}{n} \n\nGeometric mean (GM) \n\nThe geometric mean is an average that is useful for sets of positive numbers that are interpreted according to their product and not their sum (as is the case with the arithmetic mean) e.g. rates of growth.\n\n \\bar{x} \\left ( \\prod_{i\n1}^n{x_i} \\right ) ^\\tfrac1n = \\left(x_1x_2\\cdots x_n\\right)^{1/n}\n\nFor example, the geometric mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:\n(4 \\times 36 \\times 45 \\times 50 \\times 75)^{1/5} \\sqrt[5]{24\\;300\\;000} \n 30.\n\nHarmonic mean (HM) \n\nThe harmonic mean is an average which is useful for sets of numbers which are defined in relation to some unit, for example speed (distance per unit of time).\n \n \\bar{x} n \\cdot \\left ( \\sum_{i\n1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i} \\right ) ^{-1}\n\nFor example, the harmonic mean of the five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is\n\n\\frac{5}{\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{36}+\\tfrac{1}{45} + \\tfrac{1}{50} + \\tfrac{1}{75}} \\frac{5}{\\;\\tfrac{1}{3}\\;} \n 15.\n\nRelationship between AM, GM, and HM \n\nAM, GM, and HM satisfy these inequalities:\n\n \\mathrm{AM} \\ge \\mathrm{GM} \\ge \\mathrm{HM} \\, \n\nEquality holds if and only if all the elements of the given sample are equal.\n\nStatistical location\n\nIn descriptive statistics, the mean may be confused with the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may be called an \"average\" (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income, and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions.\n\nMean of a probability distribution\n\nThe mean of a probability distribution is the long-run arithmetic average value of a random variable having that distribution. In this context, it is also known as the expected value. For a discrete probability distribution, the mean is given by \\textstyle \\sum xP(x), where the sum is taken over all possible values of the random variable and P(x) is the probability mass function. For a continuous distribution,the mean is \\textstyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} xf(x)\\,dx, where f(x) is the probability density function. In all cases, including those in which the distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure. The mean need not exist or be finite; for some probability distributions the mean is infinite ( or ), while others have no mean.\n\nGeneralized means\n\nPower mean\n\nThe generalized mean, also known as the power mean or Hölder mean, is an abstraction of the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means. It is defined for a set of n positive numbers xi by\n\n \\bar{x}(m) \\left ( \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{i\n1}^n{x_i^m} \\right ) ^\\tfrac1m\n\nBy choosing different values for the parameter m, the following types of means are obtained:\n\nƒ-mean \n\nThis can be generalized further as the generalized f-mean\n \\bar{x} f^{-1}\\left({\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{i\n1}^n{f(x_i)}}\\right) \n\nand again a suitable choice of an invertible ƒ will give\n\nWeighted arithmetic mean\n\nThe weighted arithmetic mean (or weighted average) is used if one wants to combine average values from samples of the same population with different sample sizes:\n\n \\bar{x} \\frac{\\sum_{i\n1}^n{w_i \\cdot x_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n {w_i}}. \n\nThe weights w_i represent the sizes of the different samples. In other applications they represent a measure for the reliability of the influence upon the mean by the respective values.\n\nTruncated mean\n\nSometimes a set of numbers might contain outliers, i.e., data values which are much lower or much higher than the others.\nOften, outliers are erroneous data caused by artifacts. In this case, one can use a truncated mean. It involves discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end, typically an equal amount at each end, and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining data. The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of total number of values.\n\nInterquartile mean\n\nThe interquartile mean is a specific example of a truncated mean. It is simply the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of values.\n \\bar{x} {2 \\over n} \\sum_{i\n(n/4)+1}^{3n/4}{x_i} \nassuming the values have been ordered, so is simply a specific example of a weighted mean for a specific set of weights.\n\nMean of a function\n\nIn some circumstances mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (even an uncountable) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean value y_{\\text{ave}} of a function f(x). Intuitively this can be thought of as calculating the area under a section of a curve and then dividing by the length of that section. This can be done crudely by counting squares on graph paper or more precisely by integration. The integration formula is written as:\n\ny_{\\text{ave}}(a,b) = \\frac{ \\int\\limits_{a}^{b} \\! f(x)\\,dx\\, }{ b - a }\n\nCare must be taken to make sure that the integral converges. But the mean may be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.\n\nMean of angles and cyclical quantities\n\nAngles, times of day, and other cyclical quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, there will not be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.\n\nFréchet mean \n\nThe Fréchet mean gives a manner for determining the \"center\" of a mass distribution on a surface or, more generally, Riemannian manifold. Unlike many other means, the Fréchet mean is defined on a space whose elements cannot necessarily be added together or multiplied by scalars.\nIt is sometimes also known as the Karcher mean (named after Hermann Karcher).\n\nOther means\n\n*Arithmetic-geometric mean\n*Arithmetic-harmonic mean\n*Cesàro mean\n*Chisini mean\n*Contraharmonic mean\n*Elementary symmetric mean\n*Geometric-harmonic mean\n*Grand mean\n*Heinz mean\n*Heronian mean\n*Identric mean\n*Lehmer mean\n*Logarithmic mean\n*Moving average\n*Neuman-Sándor mean\n*Root mean square (quadratic mean)\n*Rényi's entropy (a generalized f-mean)\n*Spherical mean\n*Stolarsky mean\n*Weighted geometric mean\n*Weighted harmonic mean\n\nDistribution of the sample mean\n\nThe arithmetic mean of a population, or population mean, is often denoted μ. The sample mean (the arithmetic mean of a sample of values drawn from the population) makes a good estimator of the population mean, as its expected value is equal to the population mean (that is, it is an unbiased estimator). The sample mean is a random variable, not a constant, since its calculated value will randomly differ depending on which members of the population are sampled, and consequently it will have its own distribution. For a random sample of n observations from a normally distributed population, the sample mean distribution is normally distributed with mean and variance as follows:\n\n\\bar{x} \\thicksim N\\left\\{\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right\\}.\n\nOften, since the population variance is an unknown parameter, it is estimated by the mean sum of squares; when this estimated value is used, the distribution of the sample mean is no longer a normal distribution but rather a Student's t distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom.",
