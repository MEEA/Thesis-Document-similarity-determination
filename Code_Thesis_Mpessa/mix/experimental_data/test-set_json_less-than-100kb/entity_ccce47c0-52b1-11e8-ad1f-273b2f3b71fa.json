  "textBody" : "In mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a Borel measure on  a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets).D. H. Fremlin, 2000. [http://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm Measure Theory]. Torres Fremlin. Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.\n\nFormal definition\n\nLet X be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let \\mathfrak{B}(X) be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of X; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets.  A Borel measure is any measure \\mu defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. Some authors require in addition that \\mu is locally compact, meaning that \\mu(C) for every compact set C. If a Borel measure \\mu is both inner regular and outer regular, it is called a regular Borel measure (some authors also require it to be tight). If \\mu is both inner regular and locally finite, it is called a Radon measure.\n\nOn the real line\n\nThe real line \\mathbb R with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, \\mathfrak{B}(\\mathbb R) is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of \\mathbb R. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns \\mu((a,b])b-a for every half-open interval (a,b] is sometimes called \"the\" Borel measure on \\mathbb R. This measure turns out to be the restriction on the Borel σ-algebra of the Lebesgue measure \\lambda, which is a complete measure and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra. The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the completion of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra which contains all the Borel sets and has a complete measure on it. Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., \\lambda(E)\n\\mu(E) for every Borel measurable set, where \\mu is the Borel measure described above).\n\nProduct spaces\n\nIf X and Y are second-countable, Hausdorff topological spaces, then the set of Borel subsets B(X\\times Y) of their product coincides with the product of the sets B(X)\\times B(Y) of Borel subsets of X and Y.Vladimir I.

The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.\n\nLaplace transform\n\nOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure μ on the real line by the Lebesgue integral\n\n(\\mathcal{L}\\mu)(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\,d\\mu(t).\n\nAn important special case is where μ is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function f.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes\n\n(\\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\,dt\n\nwhere the lower limit of 0− is shorthand notation for\n\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.\n\nThis limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform.\n\nHausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemma\n\nGiven a Borel measure μ on a metric space X such that μ(X) > 0 and μ(B(x, r)) ≤ rs holds for some constant s > 0 and for every ball B(x, r) in X, then the Hausdorff dimension dimHaus(X) ≥ s.
