The majority of political parties have their own newspapers, and these papers conduct a lively, often highly partisan, the debate on public issues.g\n\nMail \n\nEgypt Post is the government-owned body that provides postal services.\n\nRadio \n\nSee also Egyptian Radio and Television Union & List of radio stations in Egypt\n\nRadio in Egypt is almost all government controlled, using 44 short-wave frequencies, 18 medium-wave stations, and four FM stations. There are seven regional radio stations covering the country. Egyptian Radio transmits 60 hours daily overseas in 33 languages and three hundred hours daily within Egypt. In 2000, Radio Cairo introduced new specialized (thematic) channels on its FM station. So far, they include news, music, and sports. Radio enjoys more freedom than TV in its news programs, talk shows and analysis.\n\nStarting 2003, Nile Radio Production a private company was given license to operate two radio stations, Nile FM and Nogoom FM. Nile FM broadcasts in English and Nogoom FM broadcasts in Egyptian. Both stations mostly broadcast mainly to the Greater Cairo region. In the early 2009, Radio Masr was launched, broadcasting popular Egyptian songs, news & other programs.\n\nTelevision \n\nSee also Egyptian television\nEgyptian ground-broadcast television (ERTU) is government controlled and depends heavily on commercial revenue. ETV sells its specially produced programs and soap operas to the entire Arab world. ETV has two main channels, six regional channels, and three satellite channels. Of the two main channels, Channel I uses mainly Arabic, while Channel II is dedicated to foreigners and more cultured viewers, broadcasting news in English and French as well as Arabic.\n\nEgyptian Satellite channels broadcast to the Middle East, Europe, and the U.S. East Coast. In April 1998, Egypt launched its own satellite known as NileSat 101. Seven specialized channels cover news, culture, sports, education, entertainment, health, and drama. A second, digital satellite, Nilesat 102, was launched in August 2000. Many of its channels are rented to other stations.\n\nThree new private satellite-based TV stations were launched in November 2001, marking a great change in Egyptian government policy. Dream TV 1 and 2 produce cultural programming, broadcast contemporary video clips and films featuring Arab and international actors, as well as soap operas; another private station focuses on business and general news. Both private channels transmit on NileSat.\n\nIn addition to Egyptian programming, the Middle East Broadcast Company, a Saudi television station transmitting from London (MBC), Arab Radio and Television (ART), Al-Jazeera television, and other Gulf stations as well as Western networks such as CNN and BBC, provide access to more international programs to Egyptians who own satellite receivers.\n\nLandline telephony \n\nSee also Telephone numbers in Egypt\n\nCurrently, there is a single company in charge of Landline Telephony, Telecom Egypt which is also government-controlled. \nThe government is planning to start the process for licensing a second national operator for voice and transport services by 2008, with a view to this company starting operations in 2009.\n\nCellular communications \n\nSee also Telephone numbers in Egypt\n\nCurrently, there are four companies which offer cellular communication service: Orange, Vodafone, Etisalat, and We (by Telecom Egypt). These companies also provide services surpassing voice communication, such as 4G, 3G, and mobile internet.\n\nInternet \n\nThe Internet companies market is dealt to two: infrastructure providers and service providers.\n\n* Raya (defunct)\n* NileOnline (defunct)\n* TEData\n* EGYNet (defunct)\n* Orange DSL (Previously LinkDSL)\n* Etisalat Egypt\n\nThere are 8 major Service Provider companies which sell their services to smaller ISPs.

The tie-up with the mobile operator is significant in that WAP services were introduced in May for a trial period, making Egypt one of the first countries in Africa to have introduced WAP.\n\nNileOnline and Egynet has been recently sold to Etisalat, increasing Etisalat access into the broadband market. with this acquisition all class I tier ISPs mentioned above are owned by the major telecommunication companies operating in the country.\n\nRaya is owned by Vodafone Egypt, Nileonline and Egynet are now owned by Etisalat, TEdata is owned and operated by the oldest telecom company in the region telecom Egypt and link.net is owned by Orascom telecom.\n\nOn January 27, 2011, almost all internet connectivity to Egypt was shut off by the Egyptian government.[http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml Egypt Leaves the Internet] - Renesys.com\n\nWireless Internet \n\nEgypt is following closely the efforts to standardize WiMax technologies as they permit simpler and faster access to Internet services, especially as WiMax receivers are integrated into PC processors.\nThe government is still also holding discussions with relevant stakeholders to determine the best policy framework for introducing WiMax into the market through existing or new operators.\n\nCommunication companies in Egypt \n\nLandline telephony service \n\n* Telecom Egypt\n\nCellular communication service \n\n* Orange\n* Vodafone\n* Etisalat\n* Telecom Egypt\n\nStatistics \n\nTelephones \n\nmain lines in use: 10.808 million (2006)\n\nTelephones \n\nmobile cellular: 30.047 million (2007)\n\nTelephone system \n\nlarge system; underwent extensive upgrading during the 1990s and is reasonably modern; Telecom Egypt, the landline monopoly, has been increasing service availability and in 2006 fixed-line density stood at 14 per 100 persons; as of 2007 there were three mobile-cellular networks and service is expanding rapidly\n\ndomestic \n\nprincipal centers at Alexandria, Cairo, Al Mansurah, Ismailia, Suez, and Tanta are connected by coaxial cable and microwave radio relay\n\nInternational \n\nlanding point for both the SEA-ME-WE-3 AND SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable networks; linked to the international submarine cable FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe); satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean), 1 Arabsat, and 1 Inmarsat; tropospheric scatter to Sudan; microwave radio relay to Israel; a participant in Medarabtel\n\nRadio broadcast stations \n\nAM 42 (plus 15 repeaters), FM 14, shortwave 3 (1999)\n\nRadios \n\n3.07 million (1997) \n\nTelevision Broadcast Stations \n\n98 (1995)\n\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) \n\n220 (2008)\n\nInternet Hosts \n\n5,363 (2007)\n\nPeople connected to the internet \n\n12,568,900(As of June 2009)\n;Country codes: .EG (Top-level domain)\n\nTelephone prefixes \n\nCountry code: +20\n\nMobile services:\n* Etisalat: 011\n* Orange : 012\n* Vodafone: 010\n* We: 015\n\n;Cairo (Capital) : 2\n(Includes following cities: Cairo, Giza, 6th Of October, Helwan, New Cairo)\n;Alexandria: 3\n;Banha: 13\n;10th of Ramadan: 15\n;Tanta: 40\n;Damanhour: 45\n;Marsa Matrouh: 46\n;Kafer El Sheik: 47\n;Menouf: 48\n;Mansoura: 50\n;Zagazig: 55\n;Damiette: 57\n;Suez: 62\n;Ismailia: 64\n;Red Sea: 65\n;Port Said: 66\n;El Arish: 68\n;El Tour: 69\n;Bani Suef: 82\n;Fayyoum: 84\n;Minia: 86\n;Assiout: 88\n;El Wadi El Gedid: 92\n;Sohag: 93\n;Luxor: 95\n;Qena: 96\n;Aswan: 97",
