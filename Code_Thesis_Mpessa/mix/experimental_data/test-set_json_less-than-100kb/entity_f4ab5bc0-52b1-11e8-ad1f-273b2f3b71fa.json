  "textBody" : "This article covers the organization of the Eastern Orthodox Churches rather than the doctrines, traditions, practices, or other aspects of Eastern Orthodoxy. Like the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church claims to be the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.\n\nThe term Western Orthodoxy is sometimes used to denominate what is technically a vicariate within the Antiochian Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Churches and thus a part of the Eastern Orthodox Church as that term is defined here. The term \"Western Orthodox Church\" is disfavored by members of that vicariate.\n\nIn the 5th century, Oriental Orthodoxy separated from Chalcedonian Christianity (and is therefore separate from both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church), well before the 11th century Great Schism. It should not be confused with Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nChurch governance\n\nThe Orthodox Church is a communion comprising the fifteen separate autocephalous hierarchical churches that recognize each other as \"canonical\" Orthodox Christian churches. Each constituent church is self-governing; its highest-ranking bishop (a patriarch, a metropolitan or an archbishop) reports to no higher earthly authority. Each regional church is composed of constituent eparchies (or dioceses) ruled by bishops. Some autocephalous churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy (self-government). Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a Tomos or other document of autonomy. In many cases, autonomous churches are almost completely self-governing, with the mother church retaining only the right to appoint the highest-ranking bishop (an archbishop or metropolitan) of the autonomous church.\n\nNormal governance is enacted through a synod of bishops within each church. In case of issues that go beyond the scope of a single church, multiple self-governing churches send representatives to a wider synod, sometimes wide enough to be called an Orthodox \"ecumenical council\". Such councils are deemed to have authority superior to that of any autocephalous church or its ranking bishop.\n\nThe Orthodox Church is decentralised, having no central authority, earthly head or a single Bishop in a leadership role. Thus, the Orthodox Church uses a synodical system canonically, which is significantly different from the hierarchically organised Catholic Church that follows the doctrine of papal supremacy. References to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as a leader are an erroneous interpretation of his title (\"first among equals\"). His title is of honor rather than authority and in fact the Ecumenical Patriarch has no real authority over Churches other than the Constantinopolitan. His unique role often sees the Ecumenical Patriarch referred to as the \"spiritual leader\" of the Orthodox Church in some sources, though this is not an official title of the patriarch nor is it usually used in scholarly sources on the patriarchate.\n\nThe autocephalous churches are in full communion with each other, so any priest of any of those churches may lawfully minister to any member of any of them, and no member of any is excluded from any form of worship in any of the others, including reception of the Eucharist.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church was ruled by five patriarchs: the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem; these were collectively referred to as the Pentarchy. Each patriarch had jurisdiction over bishops in a specified geographic region. This continued until 927, when the autonomous Bulgarian Archbishopric became the first newly promoted patriarchate to join the original five.\n\nThe patriarch of Rome was \"first in place of honor\" among the five patriarchs.  Disagreement about the limits of his authority was one of the causes of the Great Schism, conventionally dated to the year 1054, which split the church into the Catholic Church in the West, headed by the Bishop of Rome, and the Orthodox Church, led by the four eastern patriarchs. After the schism this honorary primacy shifted to the Patriarch of Constantinople, who had previously been accorded the second-place rank at the First Council of Constantinople.\n\nJurisdictions\n\nAutocephalous Orthodox churches\n\nRanked in order of seniority, with the year of independence (autocephaly) given in parentheses, where applicable.Serbian Orthodox Church official site: [http://www.spc.rs/eng/node/150 Помесне Православне Цркве (Autocephalous Orthodox churches)]Orthodox Church in America official site: [http://oca.org/directories/world-churches World Churches]\n\nFour Ancient Patriarchates\n\n#Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\n#Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria\n#Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch\n#Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem\n\nJunior Patriarchates\n\n#Russian Orthodox Church (1448, recognized in 1589)\n#Serbian Orthodox Church (1219)\n#Romanian Orthodox Church (1872, recognized in 1885)\n#Bulgarian Orthodox Church (870)\n#Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church (486)\n\nAutocephalous Archbishoprics \n\n#Church of Cyprus (431, recognized in 478)\n#Church of Greece (1833, recognized in 1850)\n#Albanian Orthodox Church (1922, recognized in 1937)\n#Polish Orthodox Church (1924)\n#Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church (1951, 1988)\n#Orthodox Church in America (1970)See Orthodox Church in America.\n\nThe four ancient patriarchates are the most senior, followed by the five junior patriarchates.
