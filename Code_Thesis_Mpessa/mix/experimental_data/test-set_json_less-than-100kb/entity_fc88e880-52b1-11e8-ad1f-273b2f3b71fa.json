  "textBody" : "Show Me Love is the English distribution name for the Swedish film Fucking Åmål, which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 23 October 1998 and directed by Lukas Moodysson.\n\nThe film follows the lives of two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. It first premiered outside Sweden at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. For writer Moodysson, it was his directorial debut in a full-length film. Starring in the lead roles were Rebecka Liljeberg, as Agnes, and Alexandra Dahlström, as Elin. The film received an overwhelmingly positive reception and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of Åmål in western Sweden. Only a few scenes were filmed in Åmål,Robert Wangeby, \"Smygpremiär på Fucking Åmål\", Provinstidningen Dalsland, 1998.10.13 and these were not included in the final version. The main shooting took place in the nearby town of Trollhättan, the location of Film i Väst's (producing company) studios.\"[http://www.filmivast.se/vgrtemplates/RegRightColumn____10900.aspx About Film i Väst],\" Film i Väst\n\nPlot\n\nTwo girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of Åmål in Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes' parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes' will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes' family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes' house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes' house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.\"\n\nCast\n\n* Alexandra Dahlström as Elin Olsson\n* Rebecka Liljeberg as Agnes Ahlberg\n* Erica Carlson as Jessica Olsson\n* Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\n* Stefan Hörberg as Markus\n* Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\n* Ralph Carlsson as Agnes' Father Olof\n* Maria Hedborg as Agnes' Mother Karin\n* Axel Widegren as Agnes' Little Brother Oskar\n* Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's Mother Birgitta\n\nTitle\n\nThe original title of the film, Fucking Åmål, refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene one of the girls shouts in desperation \"varför måste vi bo i fucking jävla kuk-Åmål?\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-Åmål?\").  \n\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the Academy Awards, though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee. The Hollywood industry magazine Variety refused to run an advertisement for Fucking Åmål. Thus, American distributor Strand Releasing asked for a new title. Moodysson took the new title from the song at the end of the film, by Robyn. Distributors in other native English-speaking countries then followed suit. \n* German: Raus aus Åmål (\"getting out of Åmål\")\n* Spanish: Descubriendo el Amor (\"discovering love\")\n* Portuguese: Amigas de Colégio (\"school friends\")\n* Czech: Láska je láska (\"love is love\"The Czech title is based on a Lucie Bílá song of the same name, which references homosexuality.

Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre. Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the Film i Väst studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including Åmål.\n\nHowever, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of Åmål has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music \"Fucking Åmål Festival.\"\n\nCritical and commercial response\n\nFucking Åmål received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998-9, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2,100,000.[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=8161 Lumiere data base on film admissions released in Europe].\n\nHowever, some reports outside Sweden incorrectly stated that in Sweden the film had even outgrossed the Hollywood film Titanic. In fact, Titanic had over twice as many viewers as Show Me Love in Sweden in 1998.http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id8001 Titanic received an audience in Sweden in 1998 of 2,166,584.
