He spent his childhood in Kanazawa, capital of present-day Ishikawa Prefecture in central Honshū, and was educated in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, graduating from the Tokyo Imperial University in 1879. He did postgraduate work at University of Glasgow and Anderson College in Scotland. He returned to Japan in 1883 and joined the division of chemistry at the newly established Department of Agriculture and Commerce. He learned English as a child from a Dutch family in Nagasaki and so always spoke English with a Dutch accent.\n\nWhile in the US, Takamine was married to Caroline Field Hitch.Joan Bennet for Modern Drug Discovery.

He then founded the Tokyo Artificial Fertilizer Company, where he later isolated the enzyme takadiastase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of starch. Takamine developed his diastase from koji, a fungus used in the manufacture of soy sauce and miso. Its Latin name is Aspergillus oryzae, and it is a \"designated national fungus\" (kokkin) in Japan.Pulvers, Roger,  \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20090628rp.html Jokichi Takamine: a man with fire in his belly whatever the odds]\", Japan Times, June 28, 2009, p. 8.\n\nIn 1899, Takamine was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by what is now the University of Tokyo.\n\nUnited States\n\nTakamine went as co-commissioner of the Cotton Exposition to New Orleans in 1884, where he met Lafcadio Hearn and Caroline Hitch, his future wife. He later emigrated to the United States and established his own research laboratory in New York City but licensed the exclusive production rights for Takadiastase to one of the largest US pharmaceutical companies, Parke Davis. This turned out to be a shrewd move -  he became a millionaire in a relatively short time and by the early 20th century was estimated to be worth $30 million.\n\nIn 1901 he isolated and purified the hormone adrenaline (the first effective bronchodilator for asthma) from animal glands, becoming the first to accomplish this for a glandular hormone. In 1894, Takamine applied for, and was granted, a patent titled \"Process of Making Diastatic Enzyme\" ()—the first patent on a microbial enzyme in the United States.\n\nIn 1905 he founded the Nippon Club, which was for many years located at 161 West 93rd Street in Manhattan.Gray, Christopher.
