  "textBody" : "Halldór Kiljan Laxness (; born Halldór Guðjónsson; 23 April 1902 – 8 February 1998) was a twentieth-century Icelandic writer. Laxness wrote poetry, newspaper articles, plays, travelogues, short stories, and novels. Major influences included August Strindberg, Sigmund Freud, Knut Hamsun, Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, Bertolt Brecht and Ernest Hemingway.Halldór Guðmundsson, The Islander: a Biography of Halldór Laxness. McLehose Press/Quercus, London, translated by Philip Roughton, 2008, pp. 49, 117, 149, 238, 294 In 1955 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; he is the only Icelandic Nobel laureate.\n\nEarly years\n\nLaxness was born in 1902 in Reykjavík.  His parents moved to the Laxnes farm in nearby Mosfellssveit parish when he was three. He started to read books and write stories at an early age. In 1915 and 1916 he attended the technical school in Reykjavík and by 1916 he had an article published in the newspaper Morgunblaðið. By the time his first novel was published (Barn náttúrunnar 1919), Laxness  had already begun his travels on the European continent.Guðmundsson, pp. 33-34\n\n1920s\n\nIn 1922, Laxness joined the Abbaye Saint-Maurice-et-Saint-Maur in Clervaux, Luxembourg. The monks followed the rules of Saint Benedict of Nursia. Laxness was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church early in 1923. Following his confirmation, he adopted the surname Laxness after the homestead on which he was raised and added the name Kiljan (the Icelandic name of Irish martyr Saint Killian).\n\nInside the walls of the abbey, he practiced self-study, read books, and studied French, Latin, theology and philosophy. Soon after his baptism, he became a member of a group which prayed for reversion of the Nordic countries back to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the books Undir Helgahnúk (1924) and, more importantly, in Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír (The Great Weaver from Kashmir). That novel, published in 1927, was hailed by noted Icelandic critic Kristján Albertsson: \"Finally, finally, a grand novel which towers like a cliff above the flatland of contemporary Icelandic poetry and fiction! Iceland has gained a new literary giant - it is our duty to celebrate the fact with joy!\"Albertsson, Krístian, Vaka 1.3, 1927\n\n\"Laxness's religious period did not last long; during a visit to America he became attracted to socialism.\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1955/laxness.html Halldór Laxness biography]. nobelprize.org Between 1927 and 1929 Laxness lived in the United States, giving lectures on Iceland and attempting to write screenplays for Hollywood films.Einarsson, Stefán, A History of Icelandic Literature, New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, p. 317 OCLC 264046441 He was \"enamored\" of Charlie Chaplin's film City Lights.Guðmundsson, p. 173 Laxness said that he \"did not become a socialist in America from studying manuals of socialism but from watching the starving unemployed in the parks.\"Laxness, Halldór,Alþýðubókin, Þriðja útgáfa (3rd edition), (Reykjavík, 1949), p.9 Also due, in part, to the influence of Upton Sinclair \"… Laxness joined the socialist bandwagon… with a book Alþýðubókin (The Book of the People, 1929) of brilliant burlesque and satirical essays… \"Einarsson, p. 292  \"Beside the fundamental idea of socialism, the strong sense of Icelandic individuality is also the sustaining element in Alþýðubókin.

Wesen stated:“He is an excellent painter of Icelandic scenery and settings. Yet this is not what he has conceived of as his chief mission. ‘Compassion is the source of the highest poetry. Compassion with Asta Sollilja on earth,’ he says in one of his best books… And a social passion underlies everything Halldór Laxness has written. His personal championship of contemporary social and political questions is always very strong, sometimes so strong that it threatens to hamper the artistic side of his work. His safeguard then is the astringent humour which enables him to see even people he dislikes in a redeeming light, and which also permits him to gaze far down into the labyrinths of the human soul.”Presentation address for the Nobel prize by E. Wesen, 1955\nIn his acceptance speech for the Nobel prize he spoke of:“… the moral principles she [his grandmother] instilled in me: never to harm a living creature; throughout my life, to place the poor, the humble, the meek of this world above all others; never to forget those who were slighted or neglected or who had suffered injustice, because it was they who, above all others, deserved our love and respect…”acceptance speech for the Nobel prize, 1955\nLaxness grew increasingly disenchanted with the Soviets after their military action in Hungary in 1956.Guðmundsson, p. 375\n\nIn 1957 Halldór and his wife went on a world tour, stopping in: New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Madison, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Peking, Bombay, Cairo and Rome.Guðmundsson,  pp. 380–384\n\nMajor works in this decade were Gerpla, (The Happy Warriors and Wayward Heroes) 1952, Brekkukotsannáll, (The Fish Can Sing) 1957, and  Paradísarheimt, (Paradise Reclaimed) 1960.\n\nLater years\n\nIn the 1960s Laxness was very active in the Icelandic theatre, writing and producing plays, the most successful of which was The Pigeon Banquet (Dúfnaveislan, 1966.)Modern Nordic Plays, Iceland, p. 23, Sigurður Magnússon (ed.), Twayne: New York, 1973\n\nIn 1968 Laxness published the \"visionary novel\"Sontag, Susan, At the Same Time, p.100, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux: New York, 2007 Kristnihald undir Jökli (Under the Glacier / Christianity at the Glacier).

Wesen stated:“He is an excellent painter of Icelandic scenery and settings. Yet this is not what he has conceived of as his chief mission. ‘Compassion is the source of the highest poetry. Compassion with Asta Sollilja on earth,’ he says in one of his best books… And a social passion underlies everything Halldór Laxness has written. His personal championship of contemporary social and political questions is always very strong, sometimes so strong that it threatens to hamper the artistic side of his work. His safeguard then is the astringent humour which enables him to see even people he dislikes in a redeeming light, and which also permits him to gaze far down into the labyrinths of the human soul.”Presentation address for the Nobel prize by E. Wesen, 1955\nIn his acceptance speech for the Nobel prize he spoke of:“… the moral principles she [his grandmother] instilled in me: never to harm a living creature; throughout my life, to place the poor, the humble, the meek of this world above all others; never to forget those who were slighted or neglected or who had suffered injustice, because it was they who, above all others, deserved our love and respect…”acceptance speech for the Nobel prize, 1955\nLaxness grew increasingly disenchanted with the Soviets after their military action in Hungary in 1956.Guðmundsson, p. 375\n\nIn 1957 Halldór and his wife went on a world tour, stopping in: New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Madison, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Peking, Bombay, Cairo and Rome.Guðmundsson,  pp. 380–384\n\nMajor works in this decade were Gerpla, (The Happy Warriors and Wayward Heroes) 1952, Brekkukotsannáll, (The Fish Can Sing) 1957, and  Paradísarheimt, (Paradise Reclaimed) 1960.\n\nLater years\n\nIn the 1960s Laxness was very active in the Icelandic theatre, writing and producing plays, the most successful of which was The Pigeon Banquet (Dúfnaveislan, 1966.)Modern Nordic Plays, Iceland, p. 23, Sigurður Magnússon (ed.), Twayne: New York, 1973\n\nIn 1968 Laxness published the \"visionary novel\"Sontag, Susan, At the Same Time, p.100, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux: New York, 2007 Kristnihald undir Jökli (Under the Glacier / Christianity at the Glacier).
