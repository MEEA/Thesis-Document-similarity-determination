  "textBody" : ":Outside number theory, the term multiplicative function is usually used for completely multiplicative functions. This article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions.\n\nIn number theory, a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function f(n) of a positive integer n with the property that f(1) = 1 and whenever\na and b are coprime, then\n\nf(ab) = f(a)f(b).\n\nAn arithmetic function f(n) is said to be completely multiplicative (or totally multiplicative) if f(1) 1 and f(ab) \n f(a)f(b) holds for all positive integers a and b, even when they are not coprime.\n\nExamples \n\nSome multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write:\n\n* 1(n): the constant function, defined by 1(n) = 1 (completely multiplicative)\n* Id(n): identity function, defined by Id(n) = n (completely multiplicative)\n* Idk(n): the power functions, defined by Idk(n) = nk for any complex number k (completely multiplicative). As special cases we have \n** Id0(n) = 1(n) and\n** Id1(n) = Id(n).\n* ε(n): the function defined by ε(n) 1 if n \n 1 and 0 otherwise, sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function (completely multiplicative). Sometimes written as u(n), but not to be confused with μ(n) .\n* 1C(n), the indicator function of the set C ⊂ Z, for certain sets C. The indicator function 1C(n) is multiplicative precisely when the set C has the following property for any coprime numbers a and b: the product ab is in C if and only if the numbers a and b are both themselves in C. This is the case if C is the set of squares, cubes, or k-th powers, or if C  is the set of square-free numbers.\n\nOther examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory, such as:\n\n* gcd(n,k): the greatest common divisor of n and k, as a function of n, where k is a fixed integer.\n* \\varphi(n): Euler's totient function \\varphi, counting the positive integers coprime to (but not bigger than) n\n* μ(n): the Möbius function, the parity (−1 for odd, +1 for even) of the number of prime factors of square-free numbers; 0 if n is not square-free\n* σk(n): the divisor function, which is the sum of the k-th powers of all the positive divisors of n (where k may be any complex number). Special cases we have\n** σ0(n) = d(n) the number of positive divisors of n,\n** σ1(n) = σ(n), the sum of all the positive divisors of n.\n* a(n): the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order n.\n* λ(n): the Liouville function, λ(n) = (−1)Ω(n) where Ω(n) is the total number of primes (counted with multiplicity) dividing n.  (completely multiplicative).\n* γ(n), defined by γ(n) = (−1)ω(n), where the additive function ω(n) is the number of distinct primes dividing n.\n* τ(n): the Ramanujan tau function.\n* All Dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions. For example\n** (n/p), the Legendre symbol, considered as a function of n where p is a fixed prime number.\n\nAn example of a non-multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r2(n) - the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers, positive, negative, or zero, where in counting the number of ways, reversal of order is allowed. For example:\n\n1 12 + 02 \n (−1)2 + 02 02 + 12 \n 02 + (−1)2\n\nand therefore r2(1) = 4 ≠ 1. This shows that the function is not multiplicative. However, r2(n)/4 is multiplicative.\n\nIn the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, [http://oeis.org/search?q=keyword:mult sequences of values of a multiplicative function] have the keyword \"mult\".\n\nSee arithmetic function for some other examples of non-multiplicative functions.\n\nProperties \n\nA multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers, a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus, if n is a product of powers of distinct primes, say n = pa qb ..., then \nf(n) = f(pa) f(qb) ...\n\nThis property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation, as in the following examples for n 144 \n 24 · 32:\nd(144) σ0(144) \n σ0(24)σ0(32) (10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160)(10 + 30 + 90) \n 5 · 3 = 15,\nσ(144) σ1(144) \n σ1(24)σ1(32) (11 + 21 + 41 + 81 + 161)(11 + 31 + 91) \n 31 · 13 = 403,\nσ*(144) σ*(24)σ*(32) \n (11 + 161)(11 + 91) 17 · 10 \n 170.\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\n\\varphi(144)\\varphi(24)\\varphi(32) \n 8 · 6 = 48\n\nIn general, if f(n) is a multiplicative function and a, b are any two positive integers, then\nf(a) · f(b) = f(gcd(a,b)) · f(lcm(a,b)).\n\nEvery completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers.\n\nConvolution \n\nIf f and g are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function f * g, the Dirichlet convolution of f and g, by\n (f \\, * \\, g)(n) = \\sum_{d|n} f(d) \\, g \\left( \\frac{n}{d} \\right)\nwhere the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n. \nWith this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group; the identity element is ε.
