The governmental system has been described as \"presidential with parliamentary characteristics.\"King, Blair. A [http://www.insideindonesia.org/content/view/502/29/ Inside Indonesia:Constitutional tinkering: The search for consensus is taking time] access date 23 May 2009 Following the Indonesian riots of May 1998 and the resignation of President Suharto, several political reforms were set in motion via amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia, which resulted in changes to all branches of government. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Indonesia as \"flawed democracy\" in 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nLiberal democracy era\n\nAn era of Liberal Democracy () in Indonesia began on August 17, 1950 following the dissolution of the federal United States of Indonesia less than a year after its formation, and ended with the imposition of martial law and President Sukarno's decree regarding the introduction of Guided Democracy on July 5, 1959. It saw a number of important events, including the 1955 Bandung Conference, Indonesia's first general and Constitutional Assembly elections, and an extended period of political instability, with no cabinet lasting as long as two years.\n\nGuided Democracy era\n\nGuided Democracy () was the political system in place in Indonesia from 1957 until the New Order began in 1966. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. Sukarno believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia's situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders.\n\nTransition to the New Order\n\nIndonesia's transition to the \"New Order\" in the mid-1960s, ousted the country's first president, Sukarno, after 22 years in the position. One of the most tumultuous periods in the country's modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto's 31-year presidency.\n\nDescribed as the great dhalang (\"puppet master\"), Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).  By 1965, the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 271-283\n\nOn 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action (generally labelled an \"attempted coup\") by the so-called 30 September Movement, a group from within the armed forces.  Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta.  Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the PKI, which was officially blamed for the crisis.; Ricklefs (1991), pages 280–283, 284, 287–290; Friend (2003), page 107-109, 113.\n\nThe politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later.  Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro-Western \"New Order\" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of Pancasila.\n\nNew order era\n\nThe New Order () is the term coined by the second Indonesian President Suharto to characterise his regime as he came to power in 1966. Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, Sukarno (dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or Orde Lama). The term \"New Order\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966–1998).\n\nImmediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (Angkatan 66) epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident anti-communism remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.\n\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the 1998 Indonesian Revolution and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, collusion and nepotism (widely known by the acronym KKN: korupsi, kolusi, nepotisme).[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html Stop talk of KKN]. The Jakarta Post (24 August 2001).\n\nThe reform era\n\nThe Post-Suharto era in Indonesia began with the fall of Suharto in 1998 during which Indonesia has been in a period of transition, an era known in Indonesia as Reformasi (English: ReformUS Indonesia Diplomatic and Political Cooperation Handbook, Int'l Business Publications, 2007, , [https://books.google.com/books?idzvfZnRoC_YQC&pg\nRA1-PA102 page CRS-5]Robin Bush, Nahdlatul Ulama and the Struggle for Power Within Islam and Politics in Indonesia, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2009, , [https://books.google.com/books?idSsg0aiSEyy0C&pg\nPA111 page 111]Ryan Ver Berkmoes, Lonely Planet Indonesia, 2010, , [https://books.google.com/books?id4GMBFsaFNN4C&pg\nPA49 page 49]). A more open and liberal political-social environment ensued following the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto, ending the three decades of the New Order period.\n\nA constitutional reform process lasted from 1999 to 2002, with four constitutional amendments producing important changes.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 360-361\n\nAmong these are term limits of up to 2 five-year terms for the President and Vice-President, and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose functions previously included electing the president and vice-president (since 2004 the president has been elected directly by the people), establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) (the House of Representatives) plus 130 \"regional representatives\" elected by the twenty-six provincial parliaments and sixty-five appointed members from societal groupsDenny Indrayana (2008), pp. 361-362\n\nThe DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, originally included 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and thirty-eight appointed members of the armed forces (TNI) and police (POLRI). TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR and MPR ended in 2004. Societal group representation in the MPR was eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 293-296\n\nHaving served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in 2004, the MPR became a bicameral legislature, with the creation of the Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (DPD), in which each province is represented by four members, although its legislative powers are more limited than those of the DPR. Through his appointed cabinet, the president retains the authority to conduct the administration of the government.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 265, 361, 441\n\nA general election in June 1999 produced the first freely elected national, provincial and regional parliaments in over forty years. In October 1999 the MPR elected a compromise candidate, Abdurrahman Wahid, as the country's fourth president, and Megawati Sukarnoputri — a daughter of Sukarno, the country's first president — as the vice-president. Megawati's PDI-P party had won the largest share of the vote (34%) in the general election, while Golkar, the dominant party during the Soeharto era, came in second (22%). Several other, mostly Islamic parties won shares large enough to be seated in the DPR. Further democratic elections took place in 2004 and 2009.\n\nExecutive branch\n\n|President\n|Joko Widodo\n|Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle\n|20 October 2014\n|-\n|Vice President\n|Jusuf Kalla\n|No Party\n|20 October 2014\n|}\nThe president and vice-president are selected by vote of the citizens for five-year terms. Prior to 2004, they were chosen by People's Consultative Assembly. The last election was held 9 July 2014. The president heads the Kabinet Kerja which means the cabinet of work.\nThe President of Indonesia is directly elected for a maximum of two five-year terms, and is the head of state, commander-in-chief of Indonesian armed forces and responsible for domestic governance and policy-making and foreign affairs. The president appoints a cabinet, who do not have to be elected members of the legislature.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 361, 443, 440\n\nLegislative branch\n\nThe People's Consultative Assembly (, MPR) is the legislative branch in Indonesia's political system. Following elections in 2004, the MPR became a bicameral parliament, with the creation of the DPD as its second chamber in an effort to increase regional representation.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 264-265, 367\n\nThe Regional Representatives Council (, DPD) is the upper house of The People's Consultative Assembly. The lower house is The People's Representative Council (, DPR), sometimes referred to as the House of Representatives, which has 560 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies.\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\nThe General Elections Commission (, KPU ) is the body responsible for running both parliamentary and presidential elections in Indonesia. Article 22E(5) of the Constitution rules that the Commission is national, permanent, and independent. Prior to the General Election of 2004, KPU was made up of members who were also members of political parties. However, members of KPU must now be non-partisan.\n\nJudicial branch\n\nThe Indonesian Supreme Court () is the highest level of the judicial branch. Its judges are appointed by the president. The Constitutional Court rules on constitutional and political matters (), while a Judicial Commission () oversees the judges.Denny Indrayana (2008), p266 - 267\n\nForeign relations\n\nDuring the regime of president Suharto, Indonesia built strong relations with the United States and had difficult relations with the People's Republic of China owing to Indonesia's anti-communist policies and domestic tensions with the Chinese community. It received international denunciation for its annexation of East Timor in 1978. Indonesia is a founding member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, and thereby a member of both ASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit.\n\nSince the 1980s, Indonesia has worked to develop close political and economic ties between South East Asian nations, and is also influential in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Indonesia was heavily criticised between 1975 and 1999 for allegedly suppressing human rights in East Timor, and for supporting violence against the East Timorese following the latter's secession and independence in 1999. Since 2001, the government of Indonesia has co-operated with the US in cracking down on Islamic fundamentalism and terrorist groups.",
