  "textBody" : "Esther (; ), born Hadassah (), is the eponymous heroine of the Book of Esther.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Esther was a Jewish queen of the Persian king Ahasuerus. Ahasuerus is traditionally identified with Xerxes I during the time of the Achaemenid Empire, although Josephus wrote that Esther's king husband was Xerxes' son Artaxerxes.Josephus, Antiquities. Book 11 Chapter 6 (184) In his Historia Scholastica Petrus Comestor identified Ahasuerus (Esther 1:1) as Artaxerxes III, who reconquered Egypt.https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.\n \nHer story is the basis for the celebration of Purim in Jewish tradition.\n\nIn the Bible\n\nKing Ahasuerus displayed his wealth for 180 days then held a 7-day feast in Susa (Shoushan). While in \"high spirits\" from the wine, he ordered his queen, Vashti, to appear before him and his guests to display her beauty. But when the attendants delivered the king's command to Queen Vashti, she refused to come. Furious at her refusal to obey, the king asked his wise men what should be done. One of them said that all the women in the empire would hear that \"The King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.\" Then these women would despise their husbands, which would cause many problems in the kingdom. Therefore, it would be prudent to depose Vashti.[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther \"Esther\", Jewish Encyclopedia]\n\nMany beautiful maidens were then brought before the king in order that he might choose a successor to the unruly Vashti. The King chose Esther, an orphan daughter of a Benjamite named Abihail. Esther was originally named Hadassah, meaning myrtle. She had spent her life among the Jewish exiles in Persia, where she lived under the protection of her cousin Mordecai.\n\nMordecai was the son of Jair, a Benjamite, who had been carried into captivity together with Jeconiah by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. Mordecai became chief minister of Ahasuerus and lived in the Persian capital of Susa.[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10983-mordecai \"Mordecai\", Jewish Encyclopedia] One day, while sitting at the gate of the king's palace, Mordecai overheard a plot of two eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, to kill the king. Having informed the king through Esther of the conspiracy, Mordecai brought about the execution of the two conspirators, and the event was recorded in the royal chronicles.\n\nThe grand vizier, Haman the Agagite,A descendant of the Amalekite people, of King Agag, whom King Saul of Israel was commanded by the prophet Samuel to utterly destroy because of their wickedness; but Saul chose to spare their king instead.()  Haman's hatred of the Jews may have had its root in this event. commanded Mordecai to do obeisance to him. Upon Mordecai's refusal to prostrate himself, Haman informed the king that the Jews were a useless and turbulent people and inclined to disloyalty, and he promised to pay 10,000 silver talents into the royal treasury for the permission to pillage and exterminate this alien race. The king then issued a proclamation ordering the confiscation of Jewish property and a general extermination of all the Jews within the empire.\n\nMordecai tore his robes and put ash on his head (signs of mourning or grieving) on hearing this news. Sheltered in the harem, Esther was unaware of the decree until Mordecai advised her of it through Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains. He informed her that she should not think that she would escape simply because she was in the palace. At the request of Esther, Mordecai instituted at Susa a general fast for three days.\n\nEsther could not approach the king without being summoned, on pain of death, and the king had not summoned her for thirty days, implying that she may have fallen out of favor. Nevertheless, at the end of the three days, Esther dressed in her royal apparel and went before the king, who was pleased to see her. When the king asked her what her request was, she invited the king and Haman to come to a banquet she had prepared. At the banquet they accepted her invitation to dine with her again on the following day. Haman, carried away by the joy that this honour gave him, issued orders for the erection of a gallows on which he intended to hang the hated Mordecai.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05549a.htm McMahon, Arthur. \"Esther.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 Apr. 2015]\n\nBut that night the king, being sleepless, ordered the chronicles of the nation to be read to him. Recalling that Mordecai had never been rewarded for his service in revealing the plot of the eunuchs, he asked Haman, the next day, to suggest a suitable reward for one \"whom the king desired to honour\". Thinking it was himself that the king had in mind, Haman suggested the use of the king's apparel and insignia. These the king ordered to be bestowed on Mordecai.\n\nOnly at the second dinner party, when the king was sufficiently beguiled by her charms, did Esther reveal for the first time her identity as a Jew, and accused Haman of the plot to destroy her and her people. The king ordered that Haman should be hanged on the gallows prepared for Mordecai, and, confiscating his property, bestowed it upon the intended victim. The king then appointed Mordecai as his prime minister, and issued a decree authorizing the Jews to defend themselves.\n\nPurim\n\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim, in memory of their deliverance. Haman set the date of Adar 13 to commence his campaign against the Jews. This determined the date of the festival of Purim.[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/esther-bible Crawford, Sidnie White. \"Esther: Bible\", Jewish Women's Archive]\n\nOrigin and meaning of the name Esther\n\nIt has been conjectured that the name Esther is derived from a reconstructed Median word astra meaning myrtle.\n\nAn alternative view is that Esther is derived from the theonym Ishtar. The Book of Daniel provides accounts of Jews in exile being assigned names relating to Babylonian gods and \"Mordecai\" is understood to mean servant of Marduk, a Babylonian god. \"Esther\" may have been a different Hebrew interpretation from the Proto-Semitic root \"star/'morning/evening star'\", which descended with the /th/ into the Ugaritic Athtiratu and Arabian Athtar. The derivation must then have been secondary for the initial ayin to be confused with an aleph (both represented by vowels in Akkadian), and the second consonant descended as a /s/ (like in the Aramaic asthr \"bright star\"), rather than a /sh/ as in Hebrew and most commonly in Akkadian.\n\nWilson, who identified Ahasuerus with Xerxes I and Vashti with Amestris, suggested that both \"Amestris\" and \"Esther\" derived from Akkadian Ammi-Ishtar or Ummi-Ishtar.[http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Ahasbai NeXtBible Study Dictionary, entry \"Ahasbai\"]  Hoschander alternatively suggested Ishtar-udda-sha (\"Ishtar is her light\") as the origin with the possibility of -udda-sha being connected with the similarly sounding Hebrew name Hadassah. These names however remain unattested in sources, and come from the original Babylonian Empire from 2000 BCE, not the Chaldean Empire or Persian Empire of the Book of Esther.\n\nThe TargumTargum to Esther 2:7 connects the name with the Persian word for \"star\", ستاره  setareh, explaining that Esther was so named for being as beautiful as the Morning Star.\nIn the Talmud (Tractate Yoma 29a), Esther is compared to the \"morning star\", and is considered the subject of Psalm 22, because its introduction is a \"song for the morning star\".\n\nInterpretations\n\nDianne Tidball argues that while Vashti is a \"feminist icon\", Esther is a post-feminist icon.\n\nAbraham Kuyper notes some \"disagreeable aspects\" to her character: that she should not have agreed to take Vashti's place, that she refrained from saving her nation until her own life was threatened, and that she carries out bloodthirsty vengeance.\n\nThe tale opens with Esther as beautiful and obedient, but also a relatively passive figure. During the course of the story, she evolves into someone who takes a decisive role in her own future and that of her people.[https://books.google.com/books?idNc-i_pQsiW8C&pg\nPA708&dqesther+bible&hl\nen&saX&ei\noNApVYjtKdH5yQSUh4GwBQ&ved0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v\nonepage&qesther%20bible&f\nfalse Coogan, Michael David; Brettler, Marc Zvi; Newsom, Carol Ann and Perkins, Pheme.
