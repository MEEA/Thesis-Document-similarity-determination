  "textBody" : "The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian,  million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous,  Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\n\nThe first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established.\n\nFish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \"Age of Fish\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. The ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates (tetrapods) began adapting to walking on land, as their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs. In the oceans, primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and Late Ordovician.\n\nThe first ammonites, species of molluscs, appeared. Trilobites, the mollusk-like brachiopods and the great coral reefs, were still common. The Late Devonian extinction which started about 375 million years ago severely affected marine life, killing off all placodermi, and all trilobites, save for a few species of the order Proetida.\n\nThe palaeogeography was dominated by the supercontinent of Gondwana to the south, the continent of Siberia to the north, and the early formation of the small continent of Euramerica in between.\n\nHistory\n\nThe period is named after Devon, a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found distributed throughout the county was eventually resolved by the definition of the Devonian period in the geological timescale. The Great Devonian Controversy was a long period of vigorous argument and counter-argument between the main protagonists of Roderick Murchison with Adam Sedgwick against Henry De la Beche supported by George Bellas Greenough. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named the period they proposed as the Devonian System.Rudwick M.S.J. 1985 The great Devonian controversy: the shaping of scientific knowledge among gentlemanly specialists. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.Note:\n* Sedgwick and Murchison coined the term \"Devonian system\" in:  Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Impey Murchison (1840) \"On the physical structure of Devonshire, and on the subdivisions and geological relations of its older stratified deposits, etc.,\" Transactions of the Geological Society of London, 2nd series, 5 (part II) :  633-687 (Part I) and 688-705 (Part II).

From (Sedgwick and Murchison, 1840), p. 690:  \"Again, Mr. Lonsdale, after an extensive examination of the fossils of South Devon, had pronounced them, more than a year since, to form a group intermediate between those of the Carboniferous and Silurian systems, … .\"\n*  William Lonsdale stated that in December 1837 he had suggested the existence of a stratum between the Silurian and Carboniferous ones.

From p. 724:  \" … Mr. Austen's communication [was] read December 1837, … .  It was immediately after the reading of that paper … that I formed the opinion relative to the limestones of Devonshire being of the age of the old red sandstone; and which I afterwards suggested first to Mr. Murchison and then to Prof. Sedgwick, … .\"\n\nWhile the rock beds that define the start and end of the Devonian period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy (Ogg, 2004), the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian  Mya, to the beginning of the Carboniferous  Mya (in North America, the beginning of the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous).\n\nIn nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the \"Old Red Age\", after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the Old Red Sandstone in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is \"Age of the Fishes\",[http://www.ageoffishes.org.au Age of Fishes Museum] referring to the evolution of several major groups of fish that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.Barclay, W.J. 1989. Geology of the South Wales Coalfield Pt II, the country around Abergavenny, 3rd edn. Memoir of the British Geological Survey Sheet 232 (Eng & Wales) pp18-19\n\nThe Devonian has also erroneously been characterized as a \"greenhouse age\", due to sampling bias: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the strata of western Europe and eastern North America, which at the time straddled the Equator as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where fossil signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical climates that were warm and moderately humid but in fact the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its epochs and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and South America had a warm temperate climate. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and temperate climates were more common.\n\nSubdivisions\n\nThe Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.\n\n;Early Devonian\nThe Early Devonian lasted from  and began with the Lochkovian stage, which lasted until the Pragian. It spanned from , and was followed by the Emsian, which lasted until the Middle Devonian began, .\n\n;Middle Devonian\nThe Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the Eifelian, which then gave way to the Givetian .\nDuring this time the jawless agnathan fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation and diversity of jawed fishes. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.\n\n;Late Devonian\nFinally, the Late Devonian started with the Frasnian, , during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing Famennian subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, .\n\nClimate\n\nThe Devonian was a relatively warm period, and probably lacked any glaciers. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest.  Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from conodont apatite implies an average value of 30 C in the Early Devonian.   levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around 5 C-change.  The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in  concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming. - [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_obMiamiCaptionURL&_method\nretrieve&_udiB6V61-4WJG8RT-3&_image\nfig7&_ba7&_user\n994540&_coverDate06%2F18%2F2009&_rdoc\n1&_fmtfull&_orig\nsearch&_cdi5801&view\nc&_acctC000050024&_version\n1&_urlVersion0&_userid\n994540&md5=c2a44da1f24f5dbcd2fca38aa1e133ac Graph of palaeotemperature from Conodont apatite] The climate would have affected the dominant organisms in reefs; microbes would have been the main reef-forming organisms in warm periods, with corals and stromatoporoid sponges taking the dominant role in cooler times. The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids.\n\nPaleogeography\n\nThe Devonian period was a time of great tectonic activity, as Euramerica and Gondwana drew closer together.\n\nThe continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn, which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great air-masses, the Hadley cell and the Ferrel cell. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions.\n\nNear the equator, the plate of Euramerica and Gondwana were starting to meet, beginning the early stages of the assembling of Pangaea. This activity further raised the northern Appalachian Mountains and formed the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia.\n\nThe west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in Idaho and Nevada; an approaching volcanic island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode at the beginning of the Carboniferous called the Antler orogeny.[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html Devonian Paleogeography]\n\nSea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical reef organisms lived. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the \"universal ocean\") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, Proto-Tethys Ocean, Rheic Ocean, and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).\n\nLife\n\nMarine biota\n\nSea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by bryozoa, diverse and abundant brachiopods, the enigmatic hederellids, microconchids and corals. Lily-like crinoids (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and trilobites were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jaw-less armored fish (ostracoderms) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water. Armored placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Osteichthyes) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark,  Cladoselache, appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name \"The Age of Fish\" in popular culture.\n\nThe first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400 Mya.[http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Devonian/Devonian.2.htm#Life Palaeos Paleozoic: Devonian: The Devonian Period - 2]\n\nReefs\n\nA now dry barrier reef, located in present-day Kimberley Basin of northwest Australia, once extended a thousand kilometers, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various carbonate-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous algae. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like stromatoporoids, and tabulate and rugose corals, in that order of importance.\n\nFile:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|Dunkleosteus, one of the largest armoured fish ever to roam the planet, lived during the late Devonian\nFile:Devonianfishes ntm 1905 smit 1929.gif|Early shark Cladoselache, several lobe-finned fishes, including Eusthenopteron that was an early marine tetrapod, and the placoderm Bothriolepis in a painting from 1905\nFile:PhacopidDevonian.jpg|Enrolled phacopid trilobite from the Devonian of Ohio\nFile:AuloporaDevonianSilicaShale.jpg|The common tabulate coral Aulopora from the Middle Devonian of Ohio – view of colony encrusting a brachiopod valve\nFile:Tropidoleptus carinatus.jpg|Tropidoleptus carinatus, an orthid brachiopod from the Middle Devonian of New York.\nFile:Pleurodictyum americanum Kashong.jpg|Pleurodictyum americanum, Kashong Shale, Middle Devonian of New York\nFile:HederelloidSEM.jpg|SEM image of a hederelloid from the Devonian of Michigan (largest tube diameter is 0.75 mm)\nFile:HederellaOH3.jpg|Devonian spiriferid brachiopod from Ohio which served as a host substrate for a colony of hederelloids\n\nTerrestrial biota\n\nBy the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The moss forests and bacterial and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable soils and harbored arthropods like mites, scorpions, trigonotarbids and myriapods (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian and the existence of fossils such as Climactichnites suggest that land arthropods may have appeared as early as the Cambrian). Also the first possible fossils of insects appeared around 416 Mya in the Early Devonian. Evidence for the earliest tetrapods takes the form of trace fossils in shallow lagoon environments within a marine carbonate platform/shelf during the Middle Devonian, although these traces have been questioned and an interpretation as fish feeding traces (Piscichnus) has been advanced.\n\nThe greening of land\n\nMany Early Devonian plants did not have true roots or leaves like extant plants and vascular tissue has yet to be observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as Drepanophycus likely spread by vegetative growth and primitive spores. The earliest land plants such as Cooksonia consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes and terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimeters tall. By far the largest land organism during this period was the enigmatic Prototaxites, which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than 8 meters tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest known trees, from the genus Wattieza, appeared in the Late Devonian around 385 Mya. In the Late Devonian, the tree-like ancestral Progymnosperm Archaeopteris which had conifer-like true wood and fern-like foliage and the cladoxylopsids grew.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern?topic=49480 Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds. Saikat Basu and C.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC. (See also: lignin.) These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the \"Devonian Explosion\".\n\nThe 'greening' of the continents acted as a carbon sink, and atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event. See Late Devonian extinction.\n\nAnimals and the first soils\n\nPrimitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterized a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian period. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first vertebrates to seek out a terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.\n\nLate Devonian extinction\n\nA major extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about  Mya, when all the fossil agnathan fishes, save for the psammosteid heterostraci, suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.\n\nThe Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.\n\nAmongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, conodonts, and acritarchs, as well as jawless fish, and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (but see McGhee, George R. (2013). When the Invasion of Land Failed. New York: Columbia University Press. for a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods).\n\nThe reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative.Citation needed Canadian paleontologist Digby McLaren suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the Alamo bolide impact), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.",

They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like stromatoporoids, and tabulate and rugose corals, in that order of importance.\n\nFile:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|Dunkleosteus, one of the largest armoured fish ever to roam the planet, lived during the late Devonian\nFile:Devonianfishes ntm 1905 smit 1929.gif|Early shark Cladoselache, several lobe-finned fishes, including Eusthenopteron that was an early marine tetrapod, and the placoderm Bothriolepis in a painting from 1905\nFile:PhacopidDevonian.jpg|Enrolled phacopid trilobite from the Devonian of Ohio\nFile:AuloporaDevonianSilicaShale.jpg|The common tabulate coral Aulopora from the Middle Devonian of Ohio – view of colony encrusting a brachiopod valve\nFile:Tropidoleptus carinatus.jpg|Tropidoleptus carinatus, an orthid brachiopod from the Middle Devonian of New York.\nFile:Pleurodictyum americanum Kashong.jpg|Pleurodictyum americanum, Kashong Shale, Middle Devonian of New York\nFile:HederelloidSEM.jpg|SEM image of a hederelloid from the Devonian of Michigan (largest tube diameter is 0.75 mm)\nFile:HederellaOH3.jpg|Devonian spiriferid brachiopod from Ohio which served as a host substrate for a colony of hederelloids\n\nTerrestrial biota\n\nBy the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The moss forests and bacterial and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable soils and harbored arthropods like mites, scorpions, trigonotarbids and myriapods (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian and the existence of fossils such as Climactichnites suggest that land arthropods may have appeared as early as the Cambrian). Also the first possible fossils of insects appeared around 416 Mya in the Early Devonian. Evidence for the earliest tetrapods takes the form of trace fossils in shallow lagoon environments within a marine carbonate platform/shelf during the Middle Devonian, although these traces have been questioned and an interpretation as fish feeding traces (Piscichnus) has been advanced.\n\nThe greening of land\n\nMany Early Devonian plants did not have true roots or leaves like extant plants and vascular tissue has yet to be observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as Drepanophycus likely spread by vegetative growth and primitive spores. The earliest land plants such as Cooksonia consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes and terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimeters tall. By far the largest land organism during this period was the enigmatic Prototaxites, which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than 8 meters tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest known trees, from the genus Wattieza, appeared in the Late Devonian around 385 Mya. In the Late Devonian, the tree-like ancestral Progymnosperm Archaeopteris which had conifer-like true wood and fern-like foliage and the cladoxylopsids grew.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern?topic=49480 Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds. Saikat Basu and C.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC. (See also: lignin.) These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the \"Devonian Explosion\".\n\nThe 'greening' of the continents acted as a carbon sink, and atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event. See Late Devonian extinction.\n\nAnimals and the first soils\n\nPrimitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterized a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian period. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first vertebrates to seek out a terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.\n\nLate Devonian extinction\n\nA major extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about  Mya, when all the fossil agnathan fishes, save for the psammosteid heterostraci, suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.\n\nThe Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.\n\nAmongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, conodonts, and acritarchs, as well as jawless fish, and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (but see McGhee, George R. (2013). When the Invasion of Land Failed. New York: Columbia University Press. for a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods).\n\nThe reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative.Citation needed Canadian paleontologist Digby McLaren suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the Alamo bolide impact), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.
