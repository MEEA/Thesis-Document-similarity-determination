  "textBody" : "Madeira ( , ;) is a Portuguese archipelago situated in the north Atlantic Ocean, southwest of Portugal. Its total population was estimated in 2011 at 267,785. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, located on the main island's south coast.\n\nThe archipelago is just under 400 km north of Tenerife, Canary Islands. Since 1976, the archipelago has been one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal (the other being the Azores, located to the northwest). It includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statue of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The autonomous region is an integral part of the European Union, having pronounced status as an outermost region of the European Union, as detailed in Article 299-2 of the Treaty of the European Union.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E299:EN:HTML\n\nMadeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is considered to be the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Portuguese Age of Discovery, which extended from 1415 to 1542.\n\nToday, it is a popular year-round resort, being visited every year by about one million tourists, three times its population. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, gastronomy, historical and cultural value, flora and fauna, landscapes (Laurel forest) which are classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and embroidery artisans. Its annual New Year celebrations feature the largest fireworks show in the world, as officially recognised by Guinness World Records in 2006.[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2007/11/071105.aspx]  The main harbour in Funchal is the leading Portuguese port in cruise liner dockings, being an important stopover for commercial and trans-Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. Madeira is the second richest region of Portugal by GDP per capita, only surpassed by Lisbon.\n\nHistory\n\nExploration\n\nPlutarch in his Parallel Lives (Sertorius, 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to Cádiz, he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: \"The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie 10,000 furlongs (2,011.68 km) from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed...\".\n\nArcheological evidence suggests that the islands may have been visited by the Vikings sometime between 900 and 1030.World Archaeology, Issue 66, August/September 2014, Volume 6, No. 6, page 64.\n\nLegend\n\nDuring the reign of King Edward III of England, lovers Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet were said to flee from England to France in 1346. They were driven off their course by a violent storm and their ship went aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of Machico, in memory of the young lovers.Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, p.11-17\n\nDiscovery\n\nKnowledge of some Atlantic islands, such as Madeira, existed before their formal discovery and settlement, as the islands were shown on maps as early as 1339.\n\nIn 1418, two captains under service to Prince Henry the Navigator, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named Porto Santo (English: holy harbour) in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck. The following year, an organised expedition, under the captaincy of Zarco, Vaz Teixeira, and Bartolomeu Perestrello, traveled to the island to claim it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown. Subsequently, the new settlers observed \"a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest.\"Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, p.20 Their investigation revealed it to be the larger island they called Madeira.The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by Gomes Eanes de Zurara in Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guiné. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896–1899: The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.) French author Arkan Simaan refers to these discoveries in his historical novel based on Azurara's Chronicle: L'Écuyer d'Henri le Navigateur (2007), published by Éditions l'Harmattan, Paris.\n\nSettlement\n\nThe first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.\n\nGrain production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable. These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry. Following the introduction of the first water-driven sugar mill on Madeira, sugar production increased to over 6,000 arrobas (an arroba was equal to 11 to 12 kilograms) by 1455, using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital. (Genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century.) The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders, who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies.\n\nSugarcane production was the primary engine of the island's economy, increasing the demand for labour. African slaves were used during portions of the island's history to cultivate sugar cane, and the proportion of imported slaves reached 10% of the total population of Madeira by the 16th century.Godinho, V. M. Os Descobrimentos e a Economia Mundial, Arcádia, 1965, Vol 1 and 2, Lisboa\n\nBarbary corsairs from North Africa, who enslaved Europeans from ships and coastal communities throughout the Mediterranean region, captured 1,200 people in Porto Santo in 1617.Fernando Augusto da Silva & Carlos Azevedo de Menezes, \"Porto Santo\", Elucidário Madeirense, vol. 3 (O-Z), Funchal, DRAC, p. 124.[https://books.google.com/books?id5q9zcB3JS40C&pg\nPA7&dq&hlen#v\nonepage&q&f\nfalse Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800]. Robert Davis (2004). p.7. . After the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production was shifted to Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe and elsewhere, Madeira's most important commodity product became its wine.\n\nThe British first amicably occupied the island in 1801 whereafter Colonel William Henry Clinton became governor. A detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-colonel James Willoughby Gordon garrisoned the island.\nAfter the Peace of Amiens, British troops withdrew in 1802, only to reoccupy Madeira in 1807 until the end of the Peninsular War in 1814.\n\nWorld War I\n\nOn 31 December 1916, during the Great War, a German U-boat, , captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour on Madeira. U-38 torpedoed and sank three ships, bringing the war to Portugal by extension.  The ships sunk were:\n*CS Dacia (1,856 tons), a British cable-laying vessel. Dacia had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar. It was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest, France.\n* SS Kanguroo (2,493 tons), a French specialized \"heavy-lift\" transport. \n* Surprise (680 tons), a French gunboat. Her commander and 34 crewmen (including 7 Portuguese) were killed.\n\nAfter attacking the ships, U-38 bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about 2 mi. Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced U-38 to withdraw.\n\nOn 12 December 1917, two German U-boats, SM U-156 and SM U-157 (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. The U-boats fired 40  shells. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded; a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit.\n\nCharles I (Karl I), the last Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, went to Madeira after the war. Determined to prevent an attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed he could go into exile on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded.[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E4DD1539E133A25755C0A9679D946095D6CF The New York Times], 6 November 1921 (accessed 4 May 2009) He died there on 1 April 1922 and his coffin lies in a chapel of the church in Monte.\n\nAutonomy and Modern history \n\nOn 1 July 1976, following the democratic revolution of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira, celebrated on Madeira Day. The region now has its own government and legislative assembly. \n\nOn 20 February 2010 at least 42 people died and 100 were injured by an extreme weather event that affected the Island.\n\nDrought conditions, coupled with hot and windy weather in summer, have caused numerous wildfires in recent years. The largest of the fires in August 2010 burned through 95 percent of the Funchal Ecological Park, a 1,000-hectare preserve set aside to restore native vegetation to the island.\n\nIn July 2012 Madeira was suffering again from severe drought. Wildfires broke out on 18 July, in the midst of temperatures up to 40 °C (more than 100 °F) and high winds. By 20 July, fires had spread to the nearby island of Porto Santo, and firefighters were sent from mainland Portugal to contain the multiple blazes.\n\nIn October 2012, it was reported that there was a dengue fever epidemic on the island. There was a total of 2,168 cases reported of dengue fever since the start in October 2012. The number of cases was on the decline since mid November 2012 and by 4 February 2013, no new cases had been reported.\n\nIn August 2013, a hospital and some private homes were evacuated as a wildfire approached Funchal. A number of homes were destroyed when the fire hit Monte, a suburb of Funchal.\n\nIn August 2016, wildfires caused over 1,000 people to be evacuated, and led to the death of three people - all of which are said to have been elderly and destroying 150 homes.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37030217http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/10/three-dead-including-elderly-woman-as-wildfire-hits-island-of-ma/ The wildfires threatened the capital of Madeira -Funchal - specifically, however other administrative regions of Madeira were also threatened by separate wildfires - e.g. Calheta.\n\nIn August 2017, a falling tree killed at least 13 people and injured 49 at a religious ceremony. People had gathered outside the Church of Our Lady of Monte in Monte, to celebrate the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption, which takes place on Tuesday and is a public holiday. The Lady of the Mount festival is the island's biggest.[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40940007 Falling tree kills 13 on Portuguese island of Madeira, BBC, 28.10.2017]\n\nGeography\n\nThe archipelago of Madeira is located 520 km from the African coast and 1000 km from the European continent (approximately a one-and-a-half hour flight from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon). It is found in the extreme south of the Tore-Madeira Ridge, a bathymetric structure of great dimensions oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest axis that extends for 1000 km. This submarine structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to 3500 metres; its highest submersed point is at a depth of about 150 metres (around latitude 36ºN). The origins of the Tore-Madeira Ridge are not clearly established, but may have resulted from a morphological buckling of the lithosphere.Ribeiro et al., 1996Kullberg & Kullberg, 2000\n\nIslands and islets\n\nMadeira (740.7 km²), including Ilhéu de Agostinho, Ilhéu de São Lourenço, Ilhéu Mole (northwest); Total population: 262,456 (2011 Census).\n\nPorto Santo (42.5 km²), including Ilhéu de Baixo ou da Cal, Ilhéu de Ferro, Ilhéu das Cenouras, Ilhéu de Fora, Ilhéu de Cima; Total population: 5483 (2011 Census).\n\nDesertas Islands (14.2 km²), including the three uninhabited islands: Deserta Grande Island, Bugio Island and Ilhéu de Chão;\n\nSavage Islands (3.6 km²), archipelago 280 km south-southeast of Madeira Island including three main islands and 16 uninhabited islets in two groups: the Northwest Group (Selvagem Grande Island, Ilhéu de Palheiro da Terra, Ilhéu de Palheiro do Mar) and the Southeast Group (Selvagem Pequena Island, Ilhéu Grande, Ilhéu Sul, Ilhéu Pequeno, Ilhéu Fora, Ilhéu Alto, Ilhéu Comprido, Ilhéu Redondo, Ilhéu Norte).\n\nMadeira Island\n\nThe island of Madeira is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about 6 km from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, on the Tore underwater mountain range. The volcano formed atop an east-west riftGeldemacher et al., 2000Ribeiro, 2001 in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch over 5 million years ago, continuing into the Pleistocene until about 700,000 years ago. This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres open to south in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the older eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500 years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.\n\nIt is the largest island of the group with an area of 741 km2, a length of 57 km (from Ponte de São Lourenço to Ponte do Pargo), while approximately 22 km at its widest point (from Ponte da Cruz to Ponte São Jorge), with a coastline of 150 km. It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching 1862 m at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), while much lower (below 200 metres) along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area, consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (1,862 m), Torres (1,851 m), Arieiro (1,818 m), Cidrão (1,802 m), Cedro (1,759 m), Casado (1,725 m), Grande (1,657 m), Ferreiro (1,582 m). At the end of this eruptive phase, an island circled by reefs was formed, its marine vestiges are evident in a calcareous layer in the area of Lameiros, in São Vicente (which was later explored for calcium oxide production). Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Girão, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, making the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy rains of autumn and winter usually travel to the sea.Robert White, 1851, p.4\n\nClimate\n\nMadeira has been classified as a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa/Csb). Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, there are clear variations between north- and south-facing regions, as well as between some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving mild year-round temperatures; according to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IM), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is  for the 1980–2010 period. Porto Santo has at least one weather station with a semiarid climate (BSh). On the highest windward slopes of Madeira, rainfall exceeds 1,250 mm (50 inches) per year, mostly falling between October and April. In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains of Madeira.\n\nView from Pico Do Areiro to Pico Ruivo, Madeira.JPG|View from Pico do Arieiro\n2010-03-01 18 15 54 Portugal-Porto Moniz.jpg|Lava pools in Porto Moniz\nPorto santo island panorama.jpg|Porto Santo's lack of higher mountains results in a paradoxical landscape when comparing it with its sister island Madeira\nIlhasDesertas 2008.jpg|The Desertas Islands in the distance at sunrise\nFile:Snow seen from Funchal.jpg|In some winters snow can occasionally be seen from Funchal, while the temperatures in the city stay mild\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nIn the south, there is very little left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest which once covered the whole island (the original settlers set fire to the island to clear the land for farming) and gave it the name it now bears (Madeira means \"wood\" in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys contain native trees of fine growth. These \"laurisilva\" forests, called lauraceas madeirense, notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island, are designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.The paleobotanical record of Madeira reveals that laurissilva forests has existed in this island for at least 1.8 million years. Critically endangered species such as the vine Jasminum azoricum or the rowan sorbus maderensis are endemic to Madeira.\n\nNative flora gallery\n\nClethra arborea2.jpg\nGeranium maderense 2.JPG\nGeraniumMaderense.jpg\nVaccinium padifolium.jpg\nIsoplexis sceptrum 01.jpg\nMusschia wollastonii - Ribeiro Frio, Madeira - Aug 2012.jpg\nMusschia aurea (Madeira, Portugal).jpg\nSemele androgyna 2 (scott.zona).jpg\nPonta de São Lourenço (north) - May 2007.jpg\nEchium candicans1311.jpg\n\nNative birds gallery\n\nMad-Firecrest-B.jpg\nMadeiran-Firecrest1-B.jpg\nChaffinch Madeira.jpg\nFringilla coelebs maderensis LC0285.jpg\nMadeira Buchfink-001.JPG\nCorre-Caminhos11.JPG\nTrocazaBouvryiBonaparte.jpg\nTrocazaLaurivoraBonaparte.jpg\n\nMadeiran Wall Lizard\n\nThe Madeiran wall lizard (Lacerta dugesii) is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family.  The species is endemic to the Island where is very common being and the only small lizard, ranging from sea coasts to altitudes of 1850 m. It is usually found in rocky places or among scrub and may climb into trees. It is also found in gardens and on the walls of buildings. It feeds on small invertebrates such as ants and also eats some vegetable matter. The tail is easily shed and the stump regenerates slowly. Females lay two to three clutches of eggs in a year with the juveniles being about 3 cm when they hatch. The colouring is variable and tends to match the colour of the animal's surroundings, being some shade of brown or grey with occasionally a greenish tinge. Most animals are finely flecked with darker markings. The underparts are white or cream, sometimes with dark spots, with some males having orange or red underparts and blue throats, but these bright colours may fade if the animal is disturbed. The Madeiran wall lizard grows to a snout-to-vent length of about 8 cm with a tail about 1.7 times the length of its body.  Females lay two to three clutches of eggs in a year with the juveniles being about 3 cm when they hatch.\n\nLevadas\n\nThe island of Madeira is wet in the northwest, but dry in the southeast. In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas or aqueducts to carry water to the agricultural regions in the south. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was difficult and often convicts or slaves were used. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 mi of tunnels, some of which are still accessible.\n\nToday the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island, but provide hydro-electric power. There are over 1350 mi of levadas and they provide a network of walking paths. Some provide easy and relaxing walks through the countryside, but others are narrow, crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death.\n\nTwo of the most popular levadas to hike are the Levada do Caldeirão Verde and the Levada do Caldeirão do Inferno, which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets. The Levada do Caniçal is a much easier walk, running  from Maroços to the Caniçal Tunnel. It is known as the mimosa levada, because mimosa trees are found all along the route.\n\nGovernance\n\nAdministratively, Madeira (with a population of 267,302 inhabitants in 2011) and covering an area of  is organised into eleven municipalities:[http://www.freguesiasdeportugal.com/distritos_portugal/madeira.htm Map of municipalities] at FreguesiasDePortugas l.com\n\nFunchal\n\nFunchal is the capital and principal city of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, located along the southern coast of the island of Madeira. It is a modern city, located within a natural geological \"amphitheatre\" composed of vulcanological structure and fluvial hydrological forces. Beginning at the harbour (Porto de Funchal), the neighbourhoods and streets rise almost 1200 m, along gentle slopes that helped to provide a natural shelter to the early settlers.\n\nPopulation\n\nDemographics\n\nThe island was settled by Portuguese people, especially farmers from the Minho region, meaning that Madeirans (), as they are called, are ethnically Portuguese, though they have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits.\n\nThe region has a total population of just under 270,000, the majority of whom live on the main island of Madeira where the population density is 337/km²; meanwhile only around 5,000 live on the Porto Santo Island where the population density is 112/km².\n\nAbout 247,000 (96%) of the population are Catholic and Funchal is the location of the Catholic cathedral.\n\nDiaspora\n\nMadeirans migrated to the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, St. Vincent and Trinidad.\"[http://uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/38296/1420673.pdf?sequence=1 Madeiran Portuguese Migration to Guyana, St. Vincent, Antigua and Trinidad: A Comparative Overview]\" (PDF). Jo-Anne S. Ferreira, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine\"[http://www.madeira-a-z.com/what-to-do/emigration.html Madeira and Emigration]\" Madeiran immigrants in North America mostly clustered in the New England and mid-Atlantic states, Toronto, Northern California, and Hawaii. The city of New Bedford is especially rich in Madeirans, hosting the Museum of Madeira Heritage, as well as the annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament, the world's largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly drawing crowds of tens of thousands to the city's Madeira Field.\n\nIn 1846, when a famine struck Madeira over 6,000 of the inhabitants migrated to British Guiana. In 1891 they numbered 4.3% of the population.\"[http://www.guyana.org/special/portuguese.html Portuguese emigration from Madeira to British Guiana]\" In 1902 in Honolulu, Hawaii there were 5,000 Portuguese people, mostly Madeirans. In 1910 this grew to 21,000.\n\n1849 saw an emigration of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, by way of Trinidad and other locations in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s the Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland, a Presbyterian minister as well as a physician, made a stop at Funchal, Madeira on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. The Rev. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, the Rev. Kalley was arrested for his religious conversion activities and imprisoned. Another missionary from Scotland, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and other locations in the West Indies in answer for a call for sugar plantation workers. The Madeirenses exiles did not fare well in the West Indies. The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent the Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with the Rev. Arsenio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. The Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, the Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to be settled in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that anywhere from 700 to 1,000 exiles came to the United States at this time.\n\nThere are several large Madeiran communities around the world, such as the great number in the UK, including Jersey,\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/voices/funchal.shtml BBC – Jersey Voices]\" the Portuguese British community mostly made up of Madeirans celebrate Madeira Day.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe setting-up of a free trade zone has led to the installation, under more favourable conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. The Madeira Free Trade Zone, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre.\n\nMadeira has been a significant recipient of European Union aid, totalling up to €2 billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owes some €6 billion.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism is an important sector in the region's economy since it contributes 20% to the region's GDP, providing support throughout the year for commercial, transport and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and restaurants (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of Porto Santo, with its 9 km long beach and its climate, is entirely devoted to tourism.\n\nVisitors are mainly from the European Union, with German, British, Scandinavian and Portuguese tourists providing the main contingents. The average annual occupancy rate was 60.3% in 2008, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%. \n\nWhale watching\n\nWhale watching has become very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins, such as common dolphin, spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde's whale, Sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.\n\nImmigration\n\nMadeira is part of the Schengen Area.\n\nIn 2009, there were 7,105 legal immigrants living in Madeira Islands. They come mostly from Brazil (1,300), the United Kingdom (912), Venezuela (732) and Ukraine (682), according to Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF). In 2013, that number dropped to 5,829, also according to SEF. The latest figures available (2015) detail another slight drop to 5,745, the majority of which are from the United Kingdom (818), Brazil (752) and Venezuela (581). The ongoing crisis in Venezuela has increased the flux of immigrants from the nation particularly from those with double citizenship (former Madeira immigrants).\n\nRenewable energy\n\nElectricity on Madeira is provided solely through EEM - Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira, SA - who hold a monopoly for the provision of electrical supply on the autonomous region - and consists largely of fossil fuels, but with a significant supply of seasonal hydroelectricity from the Levada system, wind power and a small amount of solar. In 2011, renewable energy formed 26.5% of the electricity used in Madeira.http://www.apca.pt/publicacoes/6/paper64.pdf\n\nTransport\n\nThe Islands have two airports, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport and Porto Santo Airport, on the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo respectively. From Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the most frequent flights are to Lisbon. There are also direct flights to over 30 other airports in Europe and nearby islands.\n\nTransport between the two main islands is by plane, or ferries from the Porto Santo Line, the latter also carrying vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy thanks to construction of the Vias Rápidas, major roads that cross the island. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands.\n\nFunchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Horários do Funchal which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nFolklore music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the machete, rajao, brinquinho and cavaquinho, which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the bailinho da Madeira.\n\nEmigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajao. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\"\n\nCuisine\n\nBecause of the geographic situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, white marlin, blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others are found in the local dishes as they are found up and down the coast of Madeira.  Espada is often served with banana. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Portugal.\n\nThere are many meat dishes on Madeira, one of the most popular being espetada.\n Espetada is traditionally made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the \"T\" having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco.\n\nOther popular dishes in Madeira include açorda, feijoada, carne de vinha d'alhos.\n\nTraditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being mel de cana, literally \"sugarcane honey\" (molasses). The traditional cake of Madeira is called Bolo de Mel, which translates as (Sugarcane) \"Honey Cake\" and according to custom, is never cut with a knife, but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. The cake commonly well known as \"Madeira Cake\" in England also finds its naming roots in the Island of Madeira.\n\nMalasadas are a Madeiran creation which were taken around the world by emigrants to places such as Hawaii. In Madeira, Malasadas are mainly consumed during the Carnival of Madeira. Pastéis de nata, as in the rest of Portugal, are also very popular.\n\nMilho frito is a very popular dish in Madeira which is very similar to the Italian dish polenta. Açorda Madeirense is another popular local dish.\n\nBeverages \n\nMadeira is a fortified wine, produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation.T. Stevenson \"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\" pg 340–341 Dorling Kindersley 2005   Most countries limit the use of the term Madeira to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.\n\nA local beer called Coral is produced by the Madeira Brewery, which dates from 1872. It has achieved 2 Monde Selection Grand Gold Medals, 24 Monde Selection Gold Medals and 2 Monde Selection Silver Medals. Other alcoholic drinks are also popular in Madeira, such as the locally created Poncha, Niquita, Pé de Cabra, Aniz, as well as Portuguese drinks such as Macieira Brandy, Licor Beirão.\n\nLaranjada is a type of carbonated soft drink with an orange flavour, its name being derived from the Portuguese word laranja (\"orange\"). Launched in 1872 it was the first soft drink to be produced in Portugal, and remains very popular to the present day. Brisa drinks, a brand name, are also very popular and come in a range of flavours.\n\nThere is also a huge coffee culture in Madeira. Like in mainland Portugal, popular coffee-based drinks include Garoto, Galão, Bica, Café com Cheirinho, Mazagran, Chinesa and many more.\n\nSports\n\nSister provinces\n\nMadeira Island has the following sister provinces:\n* : Autonomous Region of Aosta Valley, Italy (1987)\n* : Bailiwick of Jersey, British Crown Dependencies (1998)\n* : Eastern Cape Province, South Africa\n* : Jeju Province, South Korea (2007)\n* : Gibraltar, British Overseas Territory (2009) http://www.cm-funchal.pt/en/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id210%3Agibraltar&catid\n79%3Asister-cities&Itemid=331\n\nPostage stamps\n\nPortugal has issued postage stamps for Madeira during several periods, beginning in 1868.\n\nNotable people\n\nThe following people were either born or have lived part of their lives in Madeira:\n* Charles I of Austria, last Emperor of Austria and last King of Hungary\n* Joe Berardo, Portuguese millionaire, and art collector\n* Rubina Berardo, Portuguese politician  \n* António de Abreu, naval officer and navigator\n* Nadia Almada, a winner of the British reality show Big Brother\n* Menasseh Ben Israel, Jewish Rabbi.\n* Charles I of Austria, deposed monarch, died in exile on Madeira in 1922\n* Catarina Fagundes, Olympic athlete for windsurf\n* Vânia Fernandes, Portuguese singer who represented Portugal in Eurovision 2008\n* José Vicente de Freitas, military general and politician\n* Vasco da Gama Rodrigues, poet, born in Paul do Mar\n* Teodósio Clemente de Gouveia, Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church\n* George Walter Grabham, geologist\n* Herberto Hélder, poet\n* Moisés Henriques, former Australian Under-19 Captain and current NSW Blues and Australian international Twenty20 cricketer\n* Alberto João Jardim, second President of the Regional Government\n* Luís Jardim, producer of music\n* Paul Langerhans, German pathologist and biologist\n* Fátima Lopes, fashion designer\n* Jaime Ornelas Camacho, first and former President of the Regional Government\n* Aires de Ornelas e Vasconcelos, former Archbishop of the former Portuguese colonial enclave Goa (in India)\n* Lloyd Mathews, British naval officer, politician and abolitionist\n* Dionísio Pestana, president of the Pestana Group\n* Rigo 23, artist\n* João Rodrigues, Olympic windsurfer\n* Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid, Portugal and former Manchester United football player\n* John Santos, photographer\n* Ana da Silva, founding member of the post-punk band The Raincoats\n* Pedro Macedo Camacho, composer \n* Flávia Brito, Miss Universo Portugal 2016, beauty pageant\n* Manoel Dias Soeyro or Menasseh Ben Israel (1604–1657), Sephardi Rabbi and publisher\n* Artur de Sousa Pinga, former CS Marítimo and FC Porto football player\n* Maximiano de Sousa (Max), popular singer, born in Funchal\n* Virgílio Teixeira, actor\n* José Travassos Valdez, 1st Count of Bonfim, governor during 1827–1828\n* Miguel Albuquerque, third and current President of the Regional Government\n* Bernardo Sousa, rally driver in the WRC",

    "aggregatedText" : "Madeira ( , ;) is a Portuguese archipelago situated in the north Atlantic Ocean, southwest of Portugal. Its total population was estimated in 2011 at 267,785. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, located on the main island's south coast.\n\nThe archipelago is just under 400 km north of Tenerife, Canary Islands. Since 1976, the archipelago has been one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal (the other being the Azores, located to the northwest). It includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statue of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The autonomous region is an integral part of the European Union, having pronounced status as an outermost region of the European Union, as detailed in Article 299-2 of the Treaty of the European Union.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E299:EN:HTML\n\nMadeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is considered to be the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Portuguese Age of Discovery, which extended from 1415 to 1542.\n\nToday, it is a popular year-round resort, being visited every year by about one million tourists, three times its population. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, gastronomy, historical and cultural value, flora and fauna, landscapes (Laurel forest) which are classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and embroidery artisans. Its annual New Year celebrations feature the largest fireworks show in the world, as officially recognised by Guinness World Records in 2006.[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2007/11/071105.aspx]  The main harbour in Funchal is the leading Portuguese port in cruise liner dockings, being an important stopover for commercial and trans-Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. Madeira is the second richest region of Portugal by GDP per capita, only surpassed by Lisbon.\n\nHistory\n\nExploration\n\nPlutarch in his Parallel Lives (Sertorius, 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to Cádiz, he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: \"The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie 10,000 furlongs (2,011.68 km) from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed...\".\n\nArcheological evidence suggests that the islands may have been visited by the Vikings sometime between 900 and 1030.World Archaeology, Issue 66, August/September 2014, Volume 6, No. 6, page 64.\n\nLegend\n\nDuring the reign of King Edward III of England, lovers Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet were said to flee from England to France in 1346. They were driven off their course by a violent storm and their ship went aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of Machico, in memory of the young lovers.Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, p.11-17\n\nDiscovery\n\nKnowledge of some Atlantic islands, such as Madeira, existed before their formal discovery and settlement, as the islands were shown on maps as early as 1339.\n\nIn 1418, two captains under service to Prince Henry the Navigator, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named Porto Santo (English: holy harbour) in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck. The following year, an organised expedition, under the captaincy of Zarco, Vaz Teixeira, and Bartolomeu Perestrello, traveled to the island to claim it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown. Subsequently, the new settlers observed \"a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest.\"Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, p.20 Their investigation revealed it to be the larger island they called Madeira.The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by Gomes Eanes de Zurara in Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guiné. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896–1899: The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.) French author Arkan Simaan refers to these discoveries in his historical novel based on Azurara's Chronicle: L'Écuyer d'Henri le Navigateur (2007), published by Éditions l'Harmattan, Paris.\n\nSettlement\n\nThe first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.\n\nGrain production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable. These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry. Following the introduction of the first water-driven sugar mill on Madeira, sugar production increased to over 6,000 arrobas (an arroba was equal to 11 to 12 kilograms) by 1455, using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital. (Genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century.) The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders, who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies.\n\nSugarcane production was the primary engine of the island's economy, increasing the demand for labour. African slaves were used during portions of the island's history to cultivate sugar cane, and the proportion of imported slaves reached 10% of the total population of Madeira by the 16th century.Godinho, V. M. Os Descobrimentos e a Economia Mundial, Arcádia, 1965, Vol 1 and 2, Lisboa\n\nBarbary corsairs from North Africa, who enslaved Europeans from ships and coastal communities throughout the Mediterranean region, captured 1,200 people in Porto Santo in 1617.Fernando Augusto da Silva & Carlos Azevedo de Menezes, \"Porto Santo\", Elucidário Madeirense, vol. 3 (O-Z), Funchal, DRAC, p. 124.[https://books.google.com/books?id5q9zcB3JS40C&pg\nPA7&dq&hlen#v\nonepage&q&f\nfalse Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800]. Robert Davis (2004). p.7. . After the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production was shifted to Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe and elsewhere, Madeira's most important commodity product became its wine.\n\nThe British first amicably occupied the island in 1801 whereafter Colonel William Henry Clinton became governor. A detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-colonel James Willoughby Gordon garrisoned the island.\nAfter the Peace of Amiens, British troops withdrew in 1802, only to reoccupy Madeira in 1807 until the end of the Peninsular War in 1814.\n\nWorld War I\n\nOn 31 December 1916, during the Great War, a German U-boat, , captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour on Madeira. U-38 torpedoed and sank three ships, bringing the war to Portugal by extension.  The ships sunk were:\n*CS Dacia (1,856 tons), a British cable-laying vessel. Dacia had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar. It was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest, France.\n* SS Kanguroo (2,493 tons), a French specialized \"heavy-lift\" transport. \n* Surprise (680 tons), a French gunboat. Her commander and 34 crewmen (including 7 Portuguese) were killed.\n\nAfter attacking the ships, U-38 bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about 2 mi. Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced U-38 to withdraw.\n\nOn 12 December 1917, two German U-boats, SM U-156 and SM U-157 (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. The U-boats fired 40  shells. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded; a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit.\n\nCharles I (Karl I), the last Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, went to Madeira after the war. Determined to prevent an attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed he could go into exile on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded.[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E4DD1539E133A25755C0A9679D946095D6CF The New York Times], 6 November 1921 (accessed 4 May 2009) He died there on 1 April 1922 and his coffin lies in a chapel of the church in Monte.\n\nAutonomy and Modern history \n\nOn 1 July 1976, following the democratic revolution of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira, celebrated on Madeira Day. The region now has its own government and legislative assembly. \n\nOn 20 February 2010 at least 42 people died and 100 were injured by an extreme weather event that affected the Island.\n\nDrought conditions, coupled with hot and windy weather in summer, have caused numerous wildfires in recent years. The largest of the fires in August 2010 burned through 95 percent of the Funchal Ecological Park, a 1,000-hectare preserve set aside to restore native vegetation to the island.\n\nIn July 2012 Madeira was suffering again from severe drought. Wildfires broke out on 18 July, in the midst of temperatures up to 40 °C (more than 100 °F) and high winds. By 20 July, fires had spread to the nearby island of Porto Santo, and firefighters were sent from mainland Portugal to contain the multiple blazes.\n\nIn October 2012, it was reported that there was a dengue fever epidemic on the island. There was a total of 2,168 cases reported of dengue fever since the start in October 2012. The number of cases was on the decline since mid November 2012 and by 4 February 2013, no new cases had been reported.\n\nIn August 2013, a hospital and some private homes were evacuated as a wildfire approached Funchal. A number of homes were destroyed when the fire hit Monte, a suburb of Funchal.\n\nIn August 2016, wildfires caused over 1,000 people to be evacuated, and led to the death of three people - all of which are said to have been elderly and destroying 150 homes.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37030217http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/10/three-dead-including-elderly-woman-as-wildfire-hits-island-of-ma/ The wildfires threatened the capital of Madeira -Funchal - specifically, however other administrative regions of Madeira were also threatened by separate wildfires - e.g. Calheta.\n\nIn August 2017, a falling tree killed at least 13 people and injured 49 at a religious ceremony. People had gathered outside the Church of Our Lady of Monte in Monte, to celebrate the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption, which takes place on Tuesday and is a public holiday. The Lady of the Mount festival is the island's biggest.[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40940007 Falling tree kills 13 on Portuguese island of Madeira, BBC, 28.10.2017]\n\nGeography\n\nThe archipelago of Madeira is located 520 km from the African coast and 1000 km from the European continent (approximately a one-and-a-half hour flight from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon). It is found in the extreme south of the Tore-Madeira Ridge, a bathymetric structure of great dimensions oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest axis that extends for 1000 km. This submarine structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to 3500 metres; its highest submersed point is at a depth of about 150 metres (around latitude 36ºN). The origins of the Tore-Madeira Ridge are not clearly established, but may have resulted from a morphological buckling of the lithosphere.Ribeiro et al., 1996Kullberg & Kullberg, 2000\n\nIslands and islets\n\nMadeira (740.7 km²), including Ilhéu de Agostinho, Ilhéu de São Lourenço, Ilhéu Mole (northwest); Total population: 262,456 (2011 Census).\n\nPorto Santo (42.5 km²), including Ilhéu de Baixo ou da Cal, Ilhéu de Ferro, Ilhéu das Cenouras, Ilhéu de Fora, Ilhéu de Cima; Total population: 5483 (2011 Census).\n\nDesertas Islands (14.2 km²), including the three uninhabited islands: Deserta Grande Island, Bugio Island and Ilhéu de Chão;\n\nSavage Islands (3.6 km²), archipelago 280 km south-southeast of Madeira Island including three main islands and 16 uninhabited islets in two groups: the Northwest Group (Selvagem Grande Island, Ilhéu de Palheiro da Terra, Ilhéu de Palheiro do Mar) and the Southeast Group (Selvagem Pequena Island, Ilhéu Grande, Ilhéu Sul, Ilhéu Pequeno, Ilhéu Fora, Ilhéu Alto, Ilhéu Comprido, Ilhéu Redondo, Ilhéu Norte).\n\nMadeira Island\n\nThe island of Madeira is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about 6 km from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, on the Tore underwater mountain range. The volcano formed atop an east-west riftGeldemacher et al., 2000Ribeiro, 2001 in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch over 5 million years ago, continuing into the Pleistocene until about 700,000 years ago. This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres open to south in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the older eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500 years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.\n\nIt is the largest island of the group with an area of 741 km2, a length of 57 km (from Ponte de São Lourenço to Ponte do Pargo), while approximately 22 km at its widest point (from Ponte da Cruz to Ponte São Jorge), with a coastline of 150 km. It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching 1862 m at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), while much lower (below 200 metres) along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area, consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (1,862 m), Torres (1,851 m), Arieiro (1,818 m), Cidrão (1,802 m), Cedro (1,759 m), Casado (1,725 m), Grande (1,657 m), Ferreiro (1,582 m). At the end of this eruptive phase, an island circled by reefs was formed, its marine vestiges are evident in a calcareous layer in the area of Lameiros, in São Vicente (which was later explored for calcium oxide production). Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Girão, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, making the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy rains of autumn and winter usually travel to the sea.Robert White, 1851, p.4\n\nClimate\n\nMadeira has been classified as a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa/Csb). Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, there are clear variations between north- and south-facing regions, as well as between some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving mild year-round temperatures; according to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IM), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is  for the 1980–2010 period. Porto Santo has at least one weather station with a semiarid climate (BSh). On the highest windward slopes of Madeira, rainfall exceeds 1,250 mm (50 inches) per year, mostly falling between October and April. In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains of Madeira.\n\nView from Pico Do Areiro to Pico Ruivo, Madeira.JPG|View from Pico do Arieiro\n2010-03-01 18 15 54 Portugal-Porto Moniz.jpg|Lava pools in Porto Moniz\nPorto santo island panorama.jpg|Porto Santo's lack of higher mountains results in a paradoxical landscape when comparing it with its sister island Madeira\nIlhasDesertas 2008.jpg|The Desertas Islands in the distance at sunrise\nFile:Snow seen from Funchal.jpg|In some winters snow can occasionally be seen from Funchal, while the temperatures in the city stay mild\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nIn the south, there is very little left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest which once covered the whole island (the original settlers set fire to the island to clear the land for farming) and gave it the name it now bears (Madeira means \"wood\" in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys contain native trees of fine growth. These \"laurisilva\" forests, called lauraceas madeirense, notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island, are designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.The paleobotanical record of Madeira reveals that laurissilva forests has existed in this island for at least 1.8 million years. Critically endangered species such as the vine Jasminum azoricum or the rowan sorbus maderensis are endemic to Madeira.\n\nNative flora gallery\n\nClethra arborea2.jpg\nGeranium maderense 2.JPG\nGeraniumMaderense.jpg\nVaccinium padifolium.jpg\nIsoplexis sceptrum 01.jpg\nMusschia wollastonii - Ribeiro Frio, Madeira - Aug 2012.jpg\nMusschia aurea (Madeira, Portugal).jpg\nSemele androgyna 2 (scott.zona).jpg\nPonta de São Lourenço (north) - May 2007.jpg\nEchium candicans1311.jpg\n\nNative birds gallery\n\nMad-Firecrest-B.jpg\nMadeiran-Firecrest1-B.jpg\nChaffinch Madeira.jpg\nFringilla coelebs maderensis LC0285.jpg\nMadeira Buchfink-001.JPG\nCorre-Caminhos11.JPG\nTrocazaBouvryiBonaparte.jpg\nTrocazaLaurivoraBonaparte.jpg\n\nMadeiran Wall Lizard\n\nThe Madeiran wall lizard (Lacerta dugesii) is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family.  The species is endemic to the Island where is very common being and the only small lizard, ranging from sea coasts to altitudes of 1850 m. It is usually found in rocky places or among scrub and may climb into trees. It is also found in gardens and on the walls of buildings. It feeds on small invertebrates such as ants and also eats some vegetable matter. The tail is easily shed and the stump regenerates slowly. Females lay two to three clutches of eggs in a year with the juveniles being about 3 cm when they hatch. The colouring is variable and tends to match the colour of the animal's surroundings, being some shade of brown or grey with occasionally a greenish tinge. Most animals are finely flecked with darker markings. The underparts are white or cream, sometimes with dark spots, with some males having orange or red underparts and blue throats, but these bright colours may fade if the animal is disturbed. The Madeiran wall lizard grows to a snout-to-vent length of about 8 cm with a tail about 1.7 times the length of its body.  Females lay two to three clutches of eggs in a year with the juveniles being about 3 cm when they hatch.\n\nLevadas\n\nThe island of Madeira is wet in the northwest, but dry in the southeast. In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas or aqueducts to carry water to the agricultural regions in the south. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was difficult and often convicts or slaves were used. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 mi of tunnels, some of which are still accessible.\n\nToday the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island, but provide hydro-electric power. There are over 1350 mi of levadas and they provide a network of walking paths. Some provide easy and relaxing walks through the countryside, but others are narrow, crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death.\n\nTwo of the most popular levadas to hike are the Levada do Caldeirão Verde and the Levada do Caldeirão do Inferno, which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets. The Levada do Caniçal is a much easier walk, running  from Maroços to the Caniçal Tunnel. It is known as the mimosa levada, because mimosa trees are found all along the route.\n\nGovernance\n\nAdministratively, Madeira (with a population of 267,302 inhabitants in 2011) and covering an area of  is organised into eleven municipalities:[http://www.freguesiasdeportugal.com/distritos_portugal/madeira.htm Map of municipalities] at FreguesiasDePortugas l.com\n\nFunchal\n\nFunchal is the capital and principal city of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, located along the southern coast of the island of Madeira. It is a modern city, located within a natural geological \"amphitheatre\" composed of vulcanological structure and fluvial hydrological forces. Beginning at the harbour (Porto de Funchal), the neighbourhoods and streets rise almost 1200 m, along gentle slopes that helped to provide a natural shelter to the early settlers.\n\nPopulation\n\nDemographics\n\nThe island was settled by Portuguese people, especially farmers from the Minho region, meaning that Madeirans (), as they are called, are ethnically Portuguese, though they have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits.\n\nThe region has a total population of just under 270,000, the majority of whom live on the main island of Madeira where the population density is 337/km²; meanwhile only around 5,000 live on the Porto Santo Island where the population density is 112/km².\n\nAbout 247,000 (96%) of the population are Catholic and Funchal is the location of the Catholic cathedral.\n\nDiaspora\n\nMadeirans migrated to the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, St. Vincent and Trinidad.\"[http://uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/38296/1420673.pdf?sequence=1 Madeiran Portuguese Migration to Guyana, St. Vincent, Antigua and Trinidad: A Comparative Overview]\" (PDF). Jo-Anne S. Ferreira, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine\"[http://www.madeira-a-z.com/what-to-do/emigration.html Madeira and Emigration]\" Madeiran immigrants in North America mostly clustered in the New England and mid-Atlantic states, Toronto, Northern California, and Hawaii. The city of New Bedford is especially rich in Madeirans, hosting the Museum of Madeira Heritage, as well as the annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament, the world's largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly drawing crowds of tens of thousands to the city's Madeira Field.\n\nIn 1846, when a famine struck Madeira over 6,000 of the inhabitants migrated to British Guiana. In 1891 they numbered 4.3% of the population.\"[http://www.guyana.org/special/portuguese.html Portuguese emigration from Madeira to British Guiana]\" In 1902 in Honolulu, Hawaii there were 5,000 Portuguese people, mostly Madeirans. In 1910 this grew to 21,000.\n\n1849 saw an emigration of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, by way of Trinidad and other locations in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s the Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland, a Presbyterian minister as well as a physician, made a stop at Funchal, Madeira on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. The Rev. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, the Rev. Kalley was arrested for his religious conversion activities and imprisoned. Another missionary from Scotland, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and other locations in the West Indies in answer for a call for sugar plantation workers. The Madeirenses exiles did not fare well in the West Indies. The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent the Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with the Rev. Arsenio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. The Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, the Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to be settled in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that anywhere from 700 to 1,000 exiles came to the United States at this time.\n\nThere are several large Madeiran communities around the world, such as the great number in the UK, including Jersey,\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/voices/funchal.shtml BBC – Jersey Voices]\" the Portuguese British community mostly made up of Madeirans celebrate Madeira Day.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe setting-up of a free trade zone has led to the installation, under more favourable conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. The Madeira Free Trade Zone, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre.\n\nMadeira has been a significant recipient of European Union aid, totalling up to €2 billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owes some €6 billion.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism is an important sector in the region's economy since it contributes 20% to the region's GDP, providing support throughout the year for commercial, transport and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and restaurants (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of Porto Santo, with its 9 km long beach and its climate, is entirely devoted to tourism.\n\nVisitors are mainly from the European Union, with German, British, Scandinavian and Portuguese tourists providing the main contingents. The average annual occupancy rate was 60.3% in 2008, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%. \n\nWhale watching\n\nWhale watching has become very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins, such as common dolphin, spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde's whale, Sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.\n\nImmigration\n\nMadeira is part of the Schengen Area.\n\nIn 2009, there were 7,105 legal immigrants living in Madeira Islands. They come mostly from Brazil (1,300), the United Kingdom (912), Venezuela (732) and Ukraine (682), according to Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF). In 2013, that number dropped to 5,829, also according to SEF. The latest figures available (2015) detail another slight drop to 5,745, the majority of which are from the United Kingdom (818), Brazil (752) and Venezuela (581). The ongoing crisis in Venezuela has increased the flux of immigrants from the nation particularly from those with double citizenship (former Madeira immigrants).\n\nRenewable energy\n\nElectricity on Madeira is provided solely through EEM - Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira, SA - who hold a monopoly for the provision of electrical supply on the autonomous region - and consists largely of fossil fuels, but with a significant supply of seasonal hydroelectricity from the Levada system, wind power and a small amount of solar. In 2011, renewable energy formed 26.5% of the electricity used in Madeira.http://www.apca.pt/publicacoes/6/paper64.pdf\n\nTransport\n\nThe Islands have two airports, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport and Porto Santo Airport, on the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo respectively. From Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the most frequent flights are to Lisbon. There are also direct flights to over 30 other airports in Europe and nearby islands.\n\nTransport between the two main islands is by plane, or ferries from the Porto Santo Line, the latter also carrying vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy thanks to construction of the Vias Rápidas, major roads that cross the island. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands.\n\nFunchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Horários do Funchal which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nFolklore music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the machete, rajao, brinquinho and cavaquinho, which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the bailinho da Madeira.\n\nEmigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajao. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\"\n\nCuisine\n\nBecause of the geographic situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, white marlin, blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others are found in the local dishes as they are found up and down the coast of Madeira.  Espada is often served with banana. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Portugal.\n\nThere are many meat dishes on Madeira, one of the most popular being espetada.\n Espetada is traditionally made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the \"T\" having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco.\n\nOther popular dishes in Madeira include açorda, feijoada, carne de vinha d'alhos.\n\nTraditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being mel de cana, literally \"sugarcane honey\" (molasses). The traditional cake of Madeira is called Bolo de Mel, which translates as (Sugarcane) \"Honey Cake\" and according to custom, is never cut with a knife, but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. The cake commonly well known as \"Madeira Cake\" in England also finds its naming roots in the Island of Madeira.\n\nMalasadas are a Madeiran creation which were taken around the world by emigrants to places such as Hawaii. In Madeira, Malasadas are mainly consumed during the Carnival of Madeira. Pastéis de nata, as in the rest of Portugal, are also very popular.\n\nMilho frito is a very popular dish in Madeira which is very similar to the Italian dish polenta. Açorda Madeirense is another popular local dish.\n\nBeverages \n\nMadeira is a fortified wine, produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation.T. Stevenson \"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\" pg 340–341 Dorling Kindersley 2005   Most countries limit the use of the term Madeira to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.\n\nA local beer called Coral is produced by the Madeira Brewery, which dates from 1872. It has achieved 2 Monde Selection Grand Gold Medals, 24 Monde Selection Gold Medals and 2 Monde Selection Silver Medals. Other alcoholic drinks are also popular in Madeira, such as the locally created Poncha, Niquita, Pé de Cabra, Aniz, as well as Portuguese drinks such as Macieira Brandy, Licor Beirão.\n\nLaranjada is a type of carbonated soft drink with an orange flavour, its name being derived from the Portuguese word laranja (\"orange\"). Launched in 1872 it was the first soft drink to be produced in Portugal, and remains very popular to the present day. Brisa drinks, a brand name, are also very popular and come in a range of flavours.\n\nThere is also a huge coffee culture in Madeira. Like in mainland Portugal, popular coffee-based drinks include Garoto, Galão, Bica, Café com Cheirinho, Mazagran, Chinesa and many more.\n\nSports\n\nSister provinces\n\nMadeira Island has the following sister provinces:\n* : Autonomous Region of Aosta Valley, Italy (1987)\n* : Bailiwick of Jersey, British Crown Dependencies (1998)\n* : Eastern Cape Province, South Africa\n* : Jeju Province, South Korea (2007)\n* : Gibraltar, British Overseas Territory (2009) http://www.cm-funchal.pt/en/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id210%3Agibraltar&catid\n79%3Asister-cities&Itemid=331\n\nPostage stamps\n\nPortugal has issued postage stamps for Madeira during several periods, beginning in 1868.\n\nNotable people\n\nThe following people were either born or have lived part of their lives in Madeira:\n* Charles I of Austria, last Emperor of Austria and last King of Hungary\n* Joe Berardo, Portuguese millionaire, and art collector\n* Rubina Berardo, Portuguese politician  \n* António de Abreu, naval officer and navigator\n* Nadia Almada, a winner of the British reality show Big Brother\n* Menasseh Ben Israel, Jewish Rabbi.\n* Charles I of Austria, deposed monarch, died in exile on Madeira in 1922\n* Catarina Fagundes, Olympic athlete for windsurf\n* Vânia Fernandes, Portuguese singer who represented Portugal in Eurovision 2008\n* José Vicente de Freitas, military general and politician\n* Vasco da Gama Rodrigues, poet, born in Paul do Mar\n* Teodósio Clemente de Gouveia, Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church\n* George Walter Grabham, geologist\n* Herberto Hélder, poet\n* Moisés Henriques, former Australian Under-19 Captain and current NSW Blues and Australian international Twenty20 cricketer\n* Alberto João Jardim, second President of the Regional Government\n* Luís Jardim, producer of music\n* Paul Langerhans, German pathologist and biologist\n* Fátima Lopes, fashion designer\n* Jaime Ornelas Camacho, first and former President of the Regional Government\n* Aires de Ornelas e Vasconcelos, former Archbishop of the former Portuguese colonial enclave Goa (in India)\n* Lloyd Mathews, British naval officer, politician and abolitionist\n* Dionísio Pestana, president of the Pestana Group\n* Rigo 23, artist\n* João Rodrigues, Olympic windsurfer\n* Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid, Portugal and former Manchester United football player\n* John Santos, photographer\n* Ana da Silva, founding member of the post-punk band The Raincoats\n* Pedro Macedo Camacho, composer \n* Flávia Brito, Miss Universo Portugal 2016, beauty pageant\n* Manoel Dias Soeyro or Menasseh Ben Israel (1604–1657), Sephardi Rabbi and publisher\n* Artur de Sousa Pinga, former CS Marítimo and FC Porto football player\n* Maximiano de Sousa (Max), popular singer, born in Funchal\n* Virgílio Teixeira, actor\n* José Travassos Valdez, 1st Count of Bonfim, governor during 1827–1828\n* Miguel Albuquerque, third and current President of the Regional Government\n* Bernardo Sousa, rally driver in the WRC.
