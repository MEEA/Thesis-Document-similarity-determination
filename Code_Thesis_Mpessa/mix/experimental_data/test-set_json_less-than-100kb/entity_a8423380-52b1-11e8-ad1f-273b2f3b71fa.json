  "textBody" : "Alfons Maria Jakob (2 July 1884 in Aschaffenburg/Bavaria – 17 October 1931 in Hamburg) was a German neurologist who worked in the field of neuropathology.\n\nHe was born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria and educated in medicine at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and Strasbourg, where he received his doctorate in 1908. During the following year, he began clinical work under the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and did laboratory work with Franz Nissl and Alois Alzheimer in Munich.[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/738.html Alfons Maria Jakob] at Who Named It\n\nIn 1911, by way of an invitation from Wilhelm Weygandt,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nJIkqCwAAQBAJ&pgPT422&lpg\nPT422&dq%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source\nbl&otscWpu4-Qd3g&sig\nypftuqt9gBRY4AB44Fbo4mH4GII&hlen&sa\nX&ved0ahUKEwjrvZCM3qLLAhVqsoMKHQGvBBs4ChDoAQgtMAM#v\nonepage&q%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f\nfalse Neurological Eponyms] edited by Peter J.

Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as prosector. During World War I he served as an army physician in Belgium, and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his habilitation for neurology and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of neuropathology.[https://books.google.com/books?id\n-TGgBQAAQBAJ&pgPA87&lpg\nPA87&dq%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source\nbl&otsLtqjFg23Fr&sig\n3UCfnUch2px79KIN-MOocNcIZS8&hlen&sa\nX&ved0ahUKEwiWvJ2f6aLLAhXmyIMKHUZrCRw4ChDoAQgvMAQ#v\nonepage&q%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f\nfalse The Man Behind the Syndrome] by Greta Beighton\n\nJakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers. His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia. He first recognised and described Alper's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (named along with Munich neuropathologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt). He gained experience in neurosyphilis, having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States (1924) and South America (1928), of which, he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of yellow fever.\n\nHe suffered from chronic osteomyelitis for the last seven years of his life.
