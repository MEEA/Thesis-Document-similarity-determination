  "textBody" : "A hogshead (abbreviated \"Hhd\", plural \"Hhds\") is a large cask of liquid (or, less often, of a food commodity).  More specifically, it refers to a specified volume, measured in either imperial or US customary measures, primarily applied to alcoholic beverages, such as wine, ale, or cider.\n\nA tobacco hogshead was used in British and American colonial times to transport and store tobacco. It was a very large wooden barrel. A standardized hogshead measured 48 in long and 30 in in diameter at the head (at least 550 L, depending on the width in the middle). Fully packed with tobacco, it weighed about 1000 lb.\n\nA wine hogshead contains about 300 L.http://www.apjohn.com.au/Upload/PrintPages/AP%20John_Technical_Specifications.pdf\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) notes that the hogshead was first standardized by an act of Parliament in 1423, though the standards continued to vary by locality and content.  For example, the OED cites an 1897 edition of Whitaker's Almanack, which specified the number of gallons of wine in a hogshead varying by type of wine: claret  (presumably) 46 impgal,  port 57 impgal, sherry 54 impgal; and Madeira 46 impgal. The American Heritage Dictionary claims that a hogshead can consist of anything from (presumably) .\n\nEventually, a hogshead of wine came to be 63 USgal, while a hogshead of beer or ale is 64 gallons (250 L if old beer/ale gallons, 245 L if imperial).\n\nA hogshead was also used as unit of measurement for sugar in Louisiana for most of the 19th century. Plantations were listed in sugar schedules as having produced x number of hogsheads of sugar or molasses. A hogshead was also used for the measurement of herring fished for sardines in Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick.\n\nThe etymology of hogshead is uncertain. According to English philologist Walter William Skeat (1835–1912), the origin is to be found in the name for a cask or liquid measure appearing in various forms in several Germanic languages, in Dutch oxhooft (modern okshoofd), Danish oxehoved, Old Swedish oxhufvod, etc. The word should therefore be \"oxhead\", \"hogshead\" being a mere corruption.
