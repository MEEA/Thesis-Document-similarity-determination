The 68020 had many improvements over the 68000, including an instruction cache; and was the first Mac processor to support a memory management unit, the Motorola 68851.\n\nThe Macintosh LC configured the 68020 to use a 16-bit system bus with ASICs that limited RAM to 10 MB (as opposed to the 32-bit limit of 4 GB).\n\nMotorola 68030 \n\nThe Motorola 68030 was the first Mac processor with an integrated memory management unit, allowing for virtual memory.  Another improvement over the 68020 was the addition of a data cache.\n\nMotorola 68040 \n\nThe Motorola 68040 had improved per-clock performance compared to the 68030, as well as larger instruction and data caches, and was the first Mac processor with an integrated floating-point unit.\n\nThe MC68LC040 version of the microprocessor subtracted the floating-point unit and was less expensive.\n\nPowerPC \n\nPowerPC 601 \n\nPowerPC 603 \n\nPowerPC 604 \n\nThe PowerPC 604e was the first Mac processor available in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration.\n\nPowerPC G3 \n\nPowerPC G4 \n\nThe PowerPC 7400 was the first Mac processor to include an AltiVec vector processing unit.\n\nThe PowerPC 7455 was the first Mac processor over 1 GHz.\n\nPowerPC G5 \n\nThe PowerPC 970 was the first 64-bit Mac processor.\n\nThe PowerPC 970MP was the first dual-core Mac processor and the first to be found in a quad-core configuration.
