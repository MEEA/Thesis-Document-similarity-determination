  "textBody" : "A lateral is an l-like consonant in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth.\n\nFor the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth (see dental consonant) or the upper gum (see alveolar consonant), but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made. The most common laterals are approximants and belong to the class of liquids, but lateral fricatives and affricates are also common in some parts of the world. Some languages, such as the Iwaidja and Ilgar languages of Australia, have  lateral flaps, and others, such as the Xhosa and Zulu languages of Africa, have lateral clicks.\n\nWhen pronouncing the labiodental fricatives, the lip blocks the airflow in the centre of the vocal tract, so the airstream proceeds along the sides instead. Nevertheless, they are not considered lateral consonants because the airflow never goes over the tongue. This is why no language makes a distinction between lateral and non-lateral labiodentals. Plosives are never lateral, but they may have lateral release. Normally,\nnasals are never lateral, but in some languages lateral nasal clicks can occur. For consonants articulated in the throat (laryngeals), the lateral distinction is meaningless, because there is no airflow over the tongue at these places of articulation.\n\nExamples\n\nEnglish has one lateral phoneme: the lateral approximant, which in many accents has two allophones. One, found before vowels as in lady or fly, is called clear l, pronounced as the alveolar lateral approximant with a \"neutral\" position of the body of the tongue. The other variant, so-called dark l found before consonants or word-finally, as in bold or tell, is pronounced as the velarized alveolar lateral approximant with the tongue assuming a spoon-like shape with its back part raised, which gives the sound a- or-like resonance. In some languages, like Albanian, those two sounds are different phonemes. East Slavic languages contrast and but do not have [l].\n\nIn many British accents (e.g. Cockney), dark may undergo vocalization through the reduction and loss of contact between the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, becoming a rounded back vowel or glide. This process turns tell into something like, as must have happened with talk or walk at some stage. A similar process happened during the development of many other languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, Old French, and Polish, in all three of these resulting in or, whence Modern French sauce as compared with Spanish salsa, or Polish Wisła (pronounced) as compared with English Vistula.\n\nIn central and Venice dialects of Venetian, intervocalic has turned into a semivocalic, so that the written word ła bała is pronounced. The orthography uses the letter ł to represent this phoneme (it specifically represents not the sound but the phoneme that is, in some dialects, and, in others,).\n\nMany aboriginal Australian languages have a series of three or four lateral approximants, as do various dialects of Irish. Rarer lateral consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many languages of India and in some Swedish dialects, and the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative, found in many Native North American languages, Welsh and Zulu. In Adyghe and some Athabaskan languages like Hän, both voiceless and voiced alveolar lateral fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have lateral affricates. Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless lateral fricatives or affricates, such as Dahalo and Zulu, but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are easy to make by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding lateral approximant (see below). Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.\n\nNearly all languages with such lateral obstruents also have the approximant. However, there are a number of exceptions, many of them located in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. For example, Tlingit has but no.Some older Tlingit speakers have, as an allophone of. This can also be analyzed as phonemic with an allophone. Other examples from the same area include Nuu-chah-nulth and Kutenai, and elsewhere, Chukchi and Kabardian.\n\nStandard Tibetan has a voiceless lateral approximant, usually romanized as lh, as in the name Lhasa.\n\nA uvular lateral approximant has been reported to occur in some speakers of American English.\n\nPashto has a retroflex lateral flap.\n\nThere are a large number of lateral click consonants; 17 occur in !Xóõ.\n\nLateral trills are also possible, but they do not occur in any known language. They may be pronounced by initiating or with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. They are sometimes used to imitate bird calls, and they are a component of Donald Duck talk.\n\nList of laterals\n\nApproximants\n\n* Dental lateral approximant\n* Voiced alveolar lateral approximant\n* Voiceless alveolar lateral approximant\n* Retroflex lateral approximant\n* Voiced palatal lateral approximant\n* Voiceless palatal lateral approximant\n* Velar lateral approximant\n* Uvular lateral approximant\n\nFricatives\n\n* Voiceless dental lateral fricative (in Wahgi)\n* Voiced dental lateral fricative (allophonic in Wahgi)\n* Voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (in Adyghe, Kabardian, Navajo, Welsh)\n* Voiced alveolar lateral fricative (in Adyghe, Kabardian, Mongolian, Tigak)\n* Voiceless retroflex lateral fricative (or [ꞎ]) (in Toda)\n* Voiced retroflex lateral fricative (in Ao)\n* Voiceless palatal lateral fricative (or []) (in Dahalo)\n* Voiceless velar lateral fricative (or []) (in Archi, Nii, Wahgi)\n* Voiced velar lateral fricative (in Archi, allophonic in Wahgi)\n\nOnly the alveolar lateral fricatives have dedicated letters in the IPA.
