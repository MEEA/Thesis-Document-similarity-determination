  "textBody" : "\"The Hound of Heaven\" is a 182-line poem written by English poet Francis Thompson (1859–1907). The poem became famous and was the source of much of Thompson's posthumous reputation. The poem was first published in Thompson's first volume of poems in 1893. It was included in the Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse (1917). Thompson's work was praised by G. K. Chesterton, and it was also an influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, who presented a paper on Thompson in 1914.\n\nThis Christian poem has been described as follows:\n\"The name is strange. It startles one at first. It is so bold, so new, so fearless. It does not attract, rather the reverse. But when one reads the poem this strangeness disappears. The meaning is understood. As the hound follows the hare, never ceasing in its running, ever drawing nearer in the chase, with unhurrying and imperturbed pace, so does God follow the fleeing soul by His Divine grace. And though in sin or in human love, away from God it seeks to hide itself, Divine grace follows after, unwearyingly follows ever after, till the soul feels its pressure forcing it to turn to Him alone in that never ending pursuit.\" J.F.X. O'Conor, S.J.\n\nMusical settings\n\n*Maurice Jacobson The Hound of Heaven\nInfluence\n\n* In 2014, N. D. Wilson wrote and directed a short film based upon the poem, titled \"The Hound of Heaven\".\n* Thompson's poem was the inspiration for a series of 23 paintings by the American painter R. H. Ives Gammell (1893–1981). Titled, A Pictorial Sequence Painted by R. H. Ives Gammell Based on The Hound of Heaven, it is considered Gammell's magnum opus. Gammell began making plans to execute the pictorial sequence during World War II and completed the series in 1956. For his paintings, Gammell used symbols drawn from C. G. Jung, primitive and medieval cultures, and biblical and mythological sources, to give visual form to Thompson's poem. The Pictorial Sequence was recently (March 15, 2013 through May 27, 2013) housed at the Maryhill Museum of Art, Goldendale, Washington, USA.See also the Maryhill Museum of Art's [http://www.maryhillmuseum.org/maryhill-museum-of-art-opens-2013-season-on-march-15-with-special-exhibitions website].\n* Thompson's poem is also the source of the phrase, \"with all deliberate speed,\" used by the Supreme Court in Brown II, the remedy phase of the famous decision on school desegregation.Chen, Jim.
