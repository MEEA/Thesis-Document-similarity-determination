Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2006.

Guglielmo directed a trading post in Bugia, a port in the Almohad dynasty's sultanate in North Africa. Fibonacci travelled with him as a young boy, and it was in Bugia (now Béjaïa, Algeria) that he learned about the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.\n\nFibonacci travelled extensively around the Mediterranean coast, meeting with many merchants and learning about their systems of doing arithmetic. He soon realised the many advantages of the Hindu-Arabic system. In 1202, he completed the Liber Abaci (Book of Abacus or Book of Calculation) which popularized Hindu–Arabic numerals in Europe.\n\nFibonacci became a guest of Emperor Frederick II, who enjoyed mathematics and science. In 1240, the Republic of Pisa honored Fibonacci (referred to as Leonardo Bigollo)See the incipit of Flos: \"Incipit flos Leonardi bigolli pisani...\" (quoted in the MS Word document [http://www.g4g4.com/MyCD5/SOURCES/SOURCE1.DOC Sources in Recreational Mathematics: An Annotated Bibliography] by David Singmaster, 18 March 2004 – emphasis added), in English: \"Here starts 'the flower' by Leonardo the wanderer of Pisa...\"The basic meanings of \"bigollo\" appear to be \"good-for-nothing\" and \"traveller\" (so it could be translated by \"vagrant\", \"vagabond\" or \"tramp\").

The book was well-received throughout educated Europe and had a profound impact on European thought. No copies of the 1202 edition are known to exist.\n\nThe 1228 edition, first section introduces the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and compares the system with other systems, such as Roman numerals, and methods to convert the other numeral systems into Hindu-Arabic numerals.
