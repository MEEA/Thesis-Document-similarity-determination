  "textBody" : "Johann Sebastian Bach composed cantatas, motets, masses, Magnificats, Passions, oratorios, four-part chorales, songs and arias. His instrumental music includes concertos, suites, sonatas, fugues, and other works for organ, harpsichord, lute, violin, cello, flute, chamber ensemble and orchestra.\n\nThere are over 1000 known compositions by Bach. Nearly all of them are listed in the ' (BWV), which is the best known and most widely used catalogue of Bach's compositions.\n\nListing Bach's compositions\n\nThe earliest lists of Bach's compositions are given by his biographers, starting from his obituary which gives a list of instrumental works printed during the composer's lifetime (from Clavier-Übung I to The Art of Fugue), followed by a list which groups other types of compositions he wrote. The first separately published biography of the composer, by Johann Nikolaus Forkel, follows the same setup: its ninth chapter first lists printed works (adding four-part chorales that were published in the second half of the 18th century), followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones. In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies (Schauer and Hilgenfeldt in 1850) had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major can be indicated as \"C. F. Peters Vol. III No. 1\", or any of the variants (\"Griepenkerl and Roitzsch Vol. 3 p. 2\", \"Peters Book 242 p. 2\", \"P. S. V., Cah. 3 (242), No. 1\", etc.)\n\nBG\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century the Bach-Gesellschaft (BG) published all of Bach's works in around 50 volumes, the so-called Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA). This offered a unique identification of all of Bach's known works, a system that was quickly adopted, for instance by the biographers: Philipp Spitta used it complementarily to the Peters edition numbering for the BG volumes that had appeared when he was writing his Bach-biography in the second half of the 19th century (e.g. \"B. G., III., p. 173\" for the above-mentioned Prelude in E-flat major), and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkel's biography.Johann Nikolaus Forkel translated (with notes and appendices) by Charles Sanford Terry. [https://archive.org/details/johannsebastian01terrgoog Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work] New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe; London: Constable. 1920. [https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up Appendix III, pp. 225–286]\n\nBut there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bach's works according to Novello's editions, or Augener's, or Schirmer's,... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bach's compositions (e.g. [https://archive.org/stream/organworksofbach00grac#page/305/mode/1up Harvey Grace's in a 1922 book on Bach's organ compositions]).\n\nNBG\n\nIn 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bach's known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the Neue Bachgesellschaft (NBG), with a new set of goals (Bach yearbook, Bach festivals, and a Bach museum). Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht was published in NBG XVII1 in 1916 (the 1730s version of the same piece, with a different orchestration, had been published in BG 24, pp. 185–192).\n\nBWV\n\nIn 1950 the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach. Wolfgang Schmieder, the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):Wolfgang Schmieder (editor). Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach. Leipzig: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1950. Unaltered up unto its eighth printing in 1986.\n\n# Kantaten (Cantatas), BWV 1–224\n# Motetten (Motets), BWV 225–231\n# Messen, Messensätze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat), BWV 232–243\n# Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios), BWV 244–249\n# Vierstimmige Choräle (Four-part chorales), BWV 250–438\n# Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet), BWV 439–524\n# Werke für Orgel (Works for organ), BWV 525–771\n# Werke für Klavier (Keyboard compositions), BWV 772–994\n# Werke für Laute (Lute compositions), BWV 995–1000\n# Kammermusik (Chamber music), BWV 1001–1040\n# Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra), BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041–1065) and Overtures (BWV 1066–1071)\n# Kanons (Canons), BWV 1072–1078\n# Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue), BWV 1079–1080\n\nFor instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became BWV 552, situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the Köchel catalogue for Mozart's compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance BWV 992 is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S. 225 = BWV 225). at \n\nAnother consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance Clavier-Übung III was partly in the organ compositions range (BWV 552 and 669–689), with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions (BWV 802–805).\n\nBWV Anh.\n\nThe Anhang (Anh.), i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\n* I – lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived (Anh. 1–23)\n* II – works of dubious authenticity (Anh. 24–155)\n* III – works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him (Anh. 156–189)\nWithin each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.\n\nBWV2a\n\nSchmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example, BWV 11, formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted: \"\" meaning \"BWV 11, inserted after BWV 249b\" (4th chapter). Similarly,  meant BWV 1083, inserted after BWV 243a (3rd chapter). Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g. \"\" became \" indicating it was now considered a spurious work.(BWV2) Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, überarbeitete und erweiterte Ausgabe. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1990.  – \n\nIn 1998 Alfred Dürr and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV2a, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.(BWV2a) Alfred Dürr, Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger. Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe, nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2. Ausgabe. Preface in English and German. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1998.  – \n\nNew additions (Nachträge) to BWV2/BWV2a included:\n* BWV 1081–1126\n* BWV Anh. 190–213\n\nA few exceptions to the principle that compositions weren't renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bach's, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV Anh. 205 (BWV2) → BWV 1121 (BWV2a, where it is in section 7 as a work for organ).[http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001516 Fantasia, c BWV 1121 [BWV 1998]; BWV Anh. 205 / Anh. II 45→] at \n\nOther renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:\n* BWV 243a: 1723 E major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major BWV 243\n* BWV 1071 renumbered to BWV 1046a (early version of the first Brandenburg Concerto)\n* BWV Anh. 198 renumbered to BWV 149/1a (earlier abandoned version of the opening movement of Cantata BWV 149)\n\nSome versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g. BWV 655b and c\n\nSlashes indicate movements: e.g. BWV 149/1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV 149. Another example: the Agnus Dei of the Mass in B minor can be indicated as BWV 232/22 (22nd movement of the composition), or alternatively as BWV 232IV/4 (BWV 232, fourth movement of Part IV).\n\n21st-century additions\n\nNumbers above BWV 1126 were added in the 21st century.\n\nReconstructed versions\n\nAn upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a reconstructed version, that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 (Supplement) p. 75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as BWV 1060R.\n\nNBA\n\nIn the meantime, the New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, abbreviated as NBA) was being published,[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nba/ Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750): New Edition of the Complete Works] at  offering a new system to refer to Bach's works, e.g. , which is Series IV, Volume 4, p. 2 (Prelude) and p. 105 (Fugue), for BWV 552.\n\nNBArev\n\nSome years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher Bärenreiter joined with the Bach Archive again to publish revised editions of some of Bach's scores. These revised editions, aligning with the NBA editions (format, layout), but outside that group of publications, were published under the name Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke – Revidierte Edition), in short: New Bach Edition – Revised (Neue Bach-Ausgabe – Revidierte Edition), abbreviated as NBArev. Where the original NBA editions were exclusively in German, the volumes of the Revised series have their introductions both in German and English. Its first volume, NBArev 1, was a new edition of the Mass in B minor, appearing in 2010.[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition] at the Bärenreiter website\n\nBC\n\nThe Bach Compendium (BC), a catalogue covering Bach's vocal works, was published in 1985. and Christoph Wolff. Bach Compendium: Analytisch-bibliographisches Repertorium der Werke Johann Sebastian Bachs, Vol. 1 (Part 1–4). Leipzig 1985ff. Occasionally works that have no BWV number can be identified by their BC number, e.g. BC C 8 for \"Der Gerechte kömmt um\" an arrangement attributed to Bach on stylistic grounds, however unmentioned in the BWV.[http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001532 Der Gerechte kömmt um ] at \n\nBNB\n\nBachs Notenbibliothek (BNB) is a list of works Bach had at his disposition. Works of other composers which were arranged by Bach and/or which he (had) copied for performance usually have a BNB number.Kirsten Beißwenger (1992). Johann Sebastian Bachs Notenbibliothek. Kassel: Bärenreiter. \n\nSBB\n\nThe Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin SBB) holds an important collection of composition manuscripts relating to Bach. Some versions of works are best known by their principal manuscript in the SBB, for instance  \n , or according to the abbreviations used at the Bach-digital website [http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002542 ].\n\nBD\n\nBach Digital, a website managed by the Leipzig Bach Archive, the Saxon State and University Library Dresden (Sächsische Landesbibliothek – Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Dresden = SLUB), SBB and Leipzig University, hosts separate pages for compositions by Bach (and by many of his relatives). The static URLs for these pages start with \"http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_\" and end with an eight-digit number (the first four being leading zeros for works in the BWV catalogue). Each of these numbers thus identify a work, e.g.:\n* No. 00000001 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000001 = BWV 1\n* No. 00000632 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000632 = BWV 552\n* No. 00001524 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001524 = BWV Anh. 213\n\nApart from later additions and corrections these numbers follow the collation of BWV numbers, however with alternative versions of the same composition inserted immediately after the BWV number of the composition to which they belong, e.g.:\n* BWV 80 = Bach Digital Work (BDW) No. \n* BWV 80a = BDW \n* BWV 80b = BDW \n* BWV 81 = BDW \n\nAn example of a later addition/correction:\n* BWV Anh. 71 → renumbered to BWV 1128 → new Bach Digital Work number beyond the one for BWV Anh. 213: BDW \n\nPrimary sources described on separate webpages (many with a facsimile of the original source) similarly have a unique number, which preceded by \"http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_\" gives the static URL for that page, e.g.\n* No. 00002542 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002542 = \n\nBy opus number, and chronological lists\n\nApart from indicating his first published keyboard composition as Opus 1, Bach didn't use opus numbers, so Bach's works can't be listed by opus number. Lists following publication chronologies are for example implied in the first list in Bach's obituary, and BG numbers (within the BGA sequence of publication) – overall lists covering all of Bach's compositions in order of first publication are however not a way Bach's compositions are usually presented.\n\nListing Bach's works according to their time of composition can't be done comprehensively: for many works the period in which they were composed is a very wide range. For Bach's larger vocal works (cantatas, Passions,...) research has led to some more or less generally accepted chronologies, covering most of these works: a catalogue in this sense is Philippe (and Gérard) Zwang's list giving a chronological number to the cantatas BWV 1–215 and 248–249.[http://www.musiqueorguequebec.ca/catal/bacjs/corrbwvz.html Johann Sebastian Bach: Correspondance Catalogues Zwang — Schmeider] at  This list was published in 1982 as Guide pratique des cantates de Bach in Paris, . A revised edition was published in 2005 ().\n\nOther composers\n\nVarious catalogues with works by other composers have intersections with collections of works associated with Bach:[http://www.bachdigital.de/content/literature.xml#workdir Works Catalogues] at \n;BR-WFB (or) BR : Bach-Repertorium numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = BR A49\nOther BRs:\n*BR-CPEB: works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (for this composer Helm and/or Wotquenne numbers are however more often used)\n*BR-JCFB: works by Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach\n;Fk (or) F : Falck catalogue numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = F 25/2\n;H : Helm numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = H 569\n;HWV : Works by George Frideric Handel, e.g. BWV Anh. 106 = HWV 605\n;TWV : Compositions by Georg Philipp Telemann, e.g. BWV 824 = TWV 32:14\n;Warb (or) W : Warburton numbers for works by Johann Christian Bach, e.g.  = W A22 (or: )\n;Wq : Wotquenne numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = Wq 145\n\nWorks in Bach's catalogues and collections\n\nThere are over 1500 works that feature in a catalogue of works by Bach, like the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, and/or in a collection of works associated with Bach (e.g. in one of the Notebooks for Anna Magdalena Bach). Of these around a thousand are original compositions by Bach, that is: more than a mere copy or transcription of an earlier work by himself or another composer.\n\nSee also Legend to the table below\n\nBy genre\n\nCantatas (BWV 1–224)\n\nSee #BWV Chapter 1 in the table above\n\nIn the 1950 first edition of the BWV the cantatas were largely listed according to their BGA number:\n* BWV 1–200: Church cantatas\n* BWV 201–216: Secular cantatas\n* BWV 217–224: Cantatas with various issues (lost, incomplete, spurious, doubtful)\nAdditionally Anh.

    "aggregatedText" : "Johann Sebastian Bach composed cantatas, motets, masses, Magnificats, Passions, oratorios, four-part chorales, songs and arias. His instrumental music includes concertos, suites, sonatas, fugues, and other works for organ, harpsichord, lute, violin, cello, flute, chamber ensemble and orchestra.\n\nThere are over 1000 known compositions by Bach. Nearly all of them are listed in the ' (BWV), which is the best known and most widely used catalogue of Bach's compositions.\n\nListing Bach's compositions\n\nThe earliest lists of Bach's compositions are given by his biographers, starting from his obituary which gives a list of instrumental works printed during the composer's lifetime (from Clavier-Übung I to The Art of Fugue), followed by a list which groups other types of compositions he wrote. The first separately published biography of the composer, by Johann Nikolaus Forkel, follows the same setup: its ninth chapter first lists printed works (adding four-part chorales that were published in the second half of the 18th century), followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones. In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies (Schauer and Hilgenfeldt in 1850) had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major can be indicated as \"C. F. Peters Vol. III No. 1\", or any of the variants (\"Griepenkerl and Roitzsch Vol. 3 p. 2\", \"Peters Book 242 p. 2\", \"P. S. V., Cah. 3 (242), No. 1\", etc.)\n\nBG\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century the Bach-Gesellschaft (BG) published all of Bach's works in around 50 volumes, the so-called Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA). This offered a unique identification of all of Bach's known works, a system that was quickly adopted, for instance by the biographers: Philipp Spitta used it complementarily to the Peters edition numbering for the BG volumes that had appeared when he was writing his Bach-biography in the second half of the 19th century (e.g. \"B. G., III., p. 173\" for the above-mentioned Prelude in E-flat major), and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkel's biography.Johann Nikolaus Forkel translated (with notes and appendices) by Charles Sanford Terry. [https://archive.org/details/johannsebastian01terrgoog Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work] New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe; London: Constable. 1920. [https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up Appendix III, pp. 225–286]\n\nBut there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bach's works according to Novello's editions, or Augener's, or Schirmer's,... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bach's compositions (e.g. [https://archive.org/stream/organworksofbach00grac#page/305/mode/1up Harvey Grace's in a 1922 book on Bach's organ compositions]).\n\nNBG\n\nIn 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bach's known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the Neue Bachgesellschaft (NBG), with a new set of goals (Bach yearbook, Bach festivals, and a Bach museum). Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht was published in NBG XVII1 in 1916 (the 1730s version of the same piece, with a different orchestration, had been published in BG 24, pp. 185–192).\n\nBWV\n\nIn 1950 the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach. Wolfgang Schmieder, the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):Wolfgang Schmieder (editor). Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach. Leipzig: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1950. Unaltered up unto its eighth printing in 1986.\n\n# Kantaten (Cantatas), BWV 1–224\n# Motetten (Motets), BWV 225–231\n# Messen, Messensätze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat), BWV 232–243\n# Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios), BWV 244–249\n# Vierstimmige Choräle (Four-part chorales), BWV 250–438\n# Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet), BWV 439–524\n# Werke für Orgel (Works for organ), BWV 525–771\n# Werke für Klavier (Keyboard compositions), BWV 772–994\n# Werke für Laute (Lute compositions), BWV 995–1000\n# Kammermusik (Chamber music), BWV 1001–1040\n# Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra), BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041–1065) and Overtures (BWV 1066–1071)\n# Kanons (Canons), BWV 1072–1078\n# Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue), BWV 1079–1080\n\nFor instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became BWV 552, situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the Köchel catalogue for Mozart's compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance BWV 992 is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S. 225 = BWV 225). at \n\nAnother consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance Clavier-Übung III was partly in the organ compositions range (BWV 552 and 669–689), with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions (BWV 802–805).\n\nBWV Anh.\n\nThe Anhang (Anh.), i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\n* I – lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived (Anh. 1–23)\n* II – works of dubious authenticity (Anh. 24–155)\n* III – works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him (Anh. 156–189)\nWithin each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.\n\nBWV2a\n\nSchmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example, BWV 11, formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted: \"\" meaning \"BWV 11, inserted after BWV 249b\" (4th chapter). Similarly,  meant BWV 1083, inserted after BWV 243a (3rd chapter). Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g. \"\" became \" indicating it was now considered a spurious work.(BWV2) Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, überarbeitete und erweiterte Ausgabe. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1990.  – \n\nIn 1998 Alfred Dürr and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV2a, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.(BWV2a) Alfred Dürr, Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger. Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe, nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2. Ausgabe. Preface in English and German. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1998.  – \n\nNew additions (Nachträge) to BWV2/BWV2a included:\n* BWV 1081–1126\n* BWV Anh. 190–213\n\nA few exceptions to the principle that compositions weren't renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bach's, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV Anh. 205 (BWV2) → BWV 1121 (BWV2a, where it is in section 7 as a work for organ).[http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001516 Fantasia, c BWV 1121 [BWV 1998]; BWV Anh. 205 / Anh. II 45→] at \n\nOther renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:\n* BWV 243a: 1723 E major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major BWV 243\n* BWV 1071 renumbered to BWV 1046a (early version of the first Brandenburg Concerto)\n* BWV Anh. 198 renumbered to BWV 149/1a (earlier abandoned version of the opening movement of Cantata BWV 149)\n\nSome versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g. BWV 655b and c\n\nSlashes indicate movements: e.g. BWV 149/1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV 149. Another example: the Agnus Dei of the Mass in B minor can be indicated as BWV 232/22 (22nd movement of the composition), or alternatively as BWV 232IV/4 (BWV 232, fourth movement of Part IV).\n\n21st-century additions\n\nNumbers above BWV 1126 were added in the 21st century.\n\nReconstructed versions\n\nAn upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a reconstructed version, that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 (Supplement) p. 75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as BWV 1060R.\n\nNBA\n\nIn the meantime, the New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, abbreviated as NBA) was being published,[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nba/ Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750): New Edition of the Complete Works] at  offering a new system to refer to Bach's works, e.g. , which is Series IV, Volume 4, p. 2 (Prelude) and p. 105 (Fugue), for BWV 552.\n\nNBArev\n\nSome years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher Bärenreiter joined with the Bach Archive again to publish revised editions of some of Bach's scores. These revised editions, aligning with the NBA editions (format, layout), but outside that group of publications, were published under the name Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke – Revidierte Edition), in short: New Bach Edition – Revised (Neue Bach-Ausgabe – Revidierte Edition), abbreviated as NBArev. Where the original NBA editions were exclusively in German, the volumes of the Revised series have their introductions both in German and English. Its first volume, NBArev 1, was a new edition of the Mass in B minor, appearing in 2010.[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition] at the Bärenreiter website\n\nBC\n\nThe Bach Compendium (BC), a catalogue covering Bach's vocal works, was published in 1985. and Christoph Wolff. Bach Compendium: Analytisch-bibliographisches Repertorium der Werke Johann Sebastian Bachs, Vol. 1 (Part 1–4). Leipzig 1985ff. Occasionally works that have no BWV number can be identified by their BC number, e.g. BC C 8 for \"Der Gerechte kömmt um\" an arrangement attributed to Bach on stylistic grounds, however unmentioned in the BWV.[http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001532 Der Gerechte kömmt um ] at \n\nBNB\n\nBachs Notenbibliothek (BNB) is a list of works Bach had at his disposition. Works of other composers which were arranged by Bach and/or which he (had) copied for performance usually have a BNB number.Kirsten Beißwenger (1992). Johann Sebastian Bachs Notenbibliothek. Kassel: Bärenreiter. \n\nSBB\n\nThe Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin SBB) holds an important collection of composition manuscripts relating to Bach. Some versions of works are best known by their principal manuscript in the SBB, for instance  \n , or according to the abbreviations used at the Bach-digital website [http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002542 ].\n\nBD\n\nBach Digital, a website managed by the Leipzig Bach Archive, the Saxon State and University Library Dresden (Sächsische Landesbibliothek – Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Dresden = SLUB), SBB and Leipzig University, hosts separate pages for compositions by Bach (and by many of his relatives). The static URLs for these pages start with \"http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_\" and end with an eight-digit number (the first four being leading zeros for works in the BWV catalogue). Each of these numbers thus identify a work, e.g.:\n* No. 00000001 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000001 = BWV 1\n* No. 00000632 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000632 = BWV 552\n* No. 00001524 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001524 = BWV Anh. 213\n\nApart from later additions and corrections these numbers follow the collation of BWV numbers, however with alternative versions of the same composition inserted immediately after the BWV number of the composition to which they belong, e.g.:\n* BWV 80 = Bach Digital Work (BDW) No. \n* BWV 80a = BDW \n* BWV 80b = BDW \n* BWV 81 = BDW \n\nAn example of a later addition/correction:\n* BWV Anh. 71 → renumbered to BWV 1128 → new Bach Digital Work number beyond the one for BWV Anh. 213: BDW \n\nPrimary sources described on separate webpages (many with a facsimile of the original source) similarly have a unique number, which preceded by \"http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_\" gives the static URL for that page, e.g.\n* No. 00002542 → http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002542 = \n\nBy opus number, and chronological lists\n\nApart from indicating his first published keyboard composition as Opus 1, Bach didn't use opus numbers, so Bach's works can't be listed by opus number. Lists following publication chronologies are for example implied in the first list in Bach's obituary, and BG numbers (within the BGA sequence of publication) – overall lists covering all of Bach's compositions in order of first publication are however not a way Bach's compositions are usually presented.\n\nListing Bach's works according to their time of composition can't be done comprehensively: for many works the period in which they were composed is a very wide range. For Bach's larger vocal works (cantatas, Passions,...) research has led to some more or less generally accepted chronologies, covering most of these works: a catalogue in this sense is Philippe (and Gérard) Zwang's list giving a chronological number to the cantatas BWV 1–215 and 248–249.[http://www.musiqueorguequebec.ca/catal/bacjs/corrbwvz.html Johann Sebastian Bach: Correspondance Catalogues Zwang — Schmeider] at  This list was published in 1982 as Guide pratique des cantates de Bach in Paris, . A revised edition was published in 2005 ().\n\nOther composers\n\nVarious catalogues with works by other composers have intersections with collections of works associated with Bach:[http://www.bachdigital.de/content/literature.xml#workdir Works Catalogues] at \n;BR-WFB (or) BR : Bach-Repertorium numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = BR A49\nOther BRs:\n*BR-CPEB: works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (for this composer Helm and/or Wotquenne numbers are however more often used)\n*BR-JCFB: works by Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach\n;Fk (or) F : Falck catalogue numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = F 25/2\n;H : Helm numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = H 569\n;HWV : Works by George Frideric Handel, e.g. BWV Anh. 106 = HWV 605\n;TWV : Compositions by Georg Philipp Telemann, e.g. BWV 824 = TWV 32:14\n;Warb (or) W : Warburton numbers for works by Johann Christian Bach, e.g.  = W A22 (or: )\n;Wq : Wotquenne numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = Wq 145\n\nWorks in Bach's catalogues and collections\n\nThere are over 1500 works that feature in a catalogue of works by Bach, like the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, and/or in a collection of works associated with Bach (e.g. in one of the Notebooks for Anna Magdalena Bach). Of these around a thousand are original compositions by Bach, that is: more than a mere copy or transcription of an earlier work by himself or another composer.\n\nSee also Legend to the table below\n\nBy genre\n\nCantatas (BWV 1–224)\n\nSee #BWV Chapter 1 in the table above\n\nIn the 1950 first edition of the BWV the cantatas were largely listed according to their BGA number:\n* BWV 1–200: Church cantatas\n* BWV 201–216: Secular cantatas\n* BWV 217–224: Cantatas with various issues (lost, incomplete, spurious, doubtful)\nAdditionally Anh.

The \"R\" addition to the BWV number is only well-established for the reconstructions included in NBA VII/7 (e.g. solo violin reconstructions of BWV 565 are not usually indicated as BWV 565R, neither is the system used for reconstructed vocal works). For some series of transcriptions and arrangements works catalogues of these transcribers/arrangers may hold sublists with works derived from compositions by Bach.\n\nReconstructed concertos\n\nSee also #Reconstructions in the table above\n\nEach reconstructed concerto is created after the harpsichord concerto for the presumed original instrument. Such reconstructions are commonly referred to as, for example, BWV 1052R (where the R stands for 'reconstructed'). Other reconstructions and completions of for instance BWV 1059 have been indicated as BWV 1059,Igor Kipnis, The London Strings, Neville Mariner. Bach: The Harpsichord Concertos. CBS 1989 or BWV 1059a.André Isoir, Le Parlement de Musique, Martin Gester. Johann Sebastian Bach: L'oeuvre pour orgue et orchestre. Calliope 1993\n\nAdaptations\n\nTranscriptions and arrangements in the catalogues of works by other composers include:\n;Ferruccio Busoni: BV B 20 to 115, many of these published in the Bach-Busoni Editions.
