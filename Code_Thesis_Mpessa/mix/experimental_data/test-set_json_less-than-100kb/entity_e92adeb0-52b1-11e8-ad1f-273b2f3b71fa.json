  "textBody" : "A dolmen is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of two or more vertical megaliths supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (\"table\"), although there are also more complex variants. Most date from the early Neolithic (40003000 BC). Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a tumulus. In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone \"skeleton\" of the burial mound intact.\n\nIt remains unclear when, why, and by whom the earliest dolmens were made. The oldest known dolmens are in Western Europe, where they were set in place around 7,000 years ago. Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens, which makes it difficult to know why they did it. They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers, despite the absence of clear evidence for this. Human remains, sometimes accompanied by artefacts, have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using radiocarbon dating. However, it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place.Lewis, S. (2009) Guide to the Menhirs and other Megaliths of Central Brittany, Nezert Books, \n\nEtymology \n\nThe word dolmen has a confused history. The word entered archaeology when Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne used it to describe megalithic tombs in his Origines gauloises (1796) using the spelling dolmin (the current spelling was introduced about a decade later and had become standard in French by about 1885).Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, , 1796–97. The Oxford English Dictionary does not mention \"dolmin\" in English and gives its first citation for \"dolmen\" from a book on Brittany in 1859, describing the word as \"The French term, used by some English authors, for a cromlech ...\".  The name was supposedly derived from a Breton language term meaning \"stone table\" but doubt has been cast on this, and the OED describes its origin as \"Modern French\". A book on Cornish antiquities from 1754 said that the current term in the Cornish language for a cromlech was tolmen (\"hole of stone\") and the OED says that \"There is reason to think that this was the term inexactly reproduced by Latour d'Auvergne [sic] as dolmen, and misapplied by him and succeeding French archaeologists to the cromlech\".OED \"Dolmen\", 1st edition, 1897  Nonetheless it has now replaced cromlech as the usual English term in archaeology, when the more technical and descriptive alternatives are not used.\n\nDolmens are known by a variety of names in other languages, including , Galician and , , Afrikaans and , , Adyghe Ispun, dysse (Danish and Norwegian), dös (Swedish),  goindol(mordenized word: stacked stone), \"dol(stone)\", \"dolmaengj (pebble-stones, varied stones)\", and . Granja is used in Portugal, Galicia, and Spain. The rarer forms anta and ganda also appear. In the Basque Country, they are attributed to the jentilak, a race of giants.\n\nThe etymology of the  and  - with Hüne/hune meaning \"giant\" - all evoke the image of giants building the structures. Of other Celtic languages,  was borrowed into English and quoit is commonly used in English in Cornwall.\n\nTypes \n\n* Great dolmen\n* Passage grave\n* Polygonal dolmen\n* Rectangular, enlarged or extended dolmen\n* Simple dolmen\n\nDolmen sites \n\nAsia \n\nKorea \n\nKorean dolmens exhibit a morphology distinct from the Atlantic European dolmen.Joussaume, Roger Dolmens for the Dead  Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988)  p. 141–142 The largest concentration of dolmens in the world is found on the Korean Peninsula. With an estimated 35,000 dolmens, Korea alone accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s total. The largest distribution of these is on the west coast area of South Korea, an area that would eventually become host to the Mahan confederacy and be united under the rule of the ancient kingdom of Baekje at one time.\n\nThree specific UNESCO World Heritage sites at Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa ( Hwasun – ) by themselves account for over 1,000 dolmens.UNESCO World Heritage List. \"Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites.\" http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977\n\nThe Korean word for dolmen is goindol () \"supported stone\". Serious studies of the Korean megalithic monuments were not undertaken until relatively recently, well after much research had already been conducted on dolmens in other regions of the world. After 1945, new research is being conducted by Korean scholars. In 1981 a curator of National Museum of Korea, Gon'gil Ji, classified Korean dolmens into two general types: northern and southern. The boundary between them falls at the Bukhan River although examples of both types are found on either side. Northern style dolmens stand above ground with a four sided chamber and a megalithic roof (also referred to as \"table type\"), while southern style dolmens are normally built into the ground and contain a stone chest or pit covered by a rock slab.\n\nKorean dolmens can also be divided into three main types: the table type, the go-table type and the unsupported capstone type. The dolmen in Ganghwa is a northern-type, table-shaped dolmen and is the biggest stone of this kind in South Korea, measuring . There are many sub-types and different styles.Megalithic Cultures in Asia, Kim Byung-mo, 1982, Hanyang University Press Southern type dolmens are associated with burials but the reason for building northern style dolmens is uncertain.\n\nDue to the vast numbers and great variation in styles, no absolute chronology of Korean dolmens has yet been established. It is generally accepted that the Korean megalithic culture emerged from the late Neolithic age, during which agriculture developed on the peninsula, and flourished throughout the Bronze Age. Some dolmens depict astronomical formations, dated up to 3000 B.C. effectively the first star-chart in the world.https://web.archive.org/web/20160924011040/http://optik2.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~somamt/gendai3/004-014HJYang.pdf  How and why Korea has produced so many dolmens are still poorly understood. There is no current conclusive theory on the origin of Korea's megalithic culture, and so it is difficult to determine the true cultural character of Korean dolmens. Some dolmens are also found in Manchuria and the Shandong Peninsula. Off the peninsula, similar specimens can be found in smaller numbers, but they are often considerably larger than the Korean dolmens.Joussaume, Roger Dolmens for the Dead  Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988)  p. 280 It is a mystery why this culture flourished so extensively only on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in Northeast Asia.\n\nIndia \n\n*Karnataka: In Karnataka more than 50 dolmens are identified on top of Pandavara Betta about 7 km away from Somwarpet towards Shaniwar Sante in Madikeri (Coorg) District.\n*Tamil Nadu: In Tamil Nadu more than 100 dolmens are identified in the Moral Pari near Mallachandram  located 19 km from Krishnagiri district, Tamil Nadu.\n\nThere are also dolmens in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in South India.\n\nCaucasus \n\nOver 3,000 dolmens and other structures can be found in the North-Western Caucasus region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These dolmens are related to the Maykop culture. This great city of dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a round screw of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete. The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by Scythian invaders in the early first millennium BC. The metal workers were enslaved.\n\nMiddle East \n\nDolmens can be found in Israel, Syria, Iran and Jordan. Numerous large dolmens are in the Israeli National park at Gamla and some of dolmens can be viewed in the meshkin shahr at shahr yeri or pirazmian.Oldest archaeological org in Israel: http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id1164&mag_id\n115\n\nThere are many examples of flint dolmens in the historical villages of Johfiyeh and Natifah in northern Jordan. The greatest number of dolmens are around Madaba, like the ones at Al Faiha village, 10 km to the west of Madaba city. Two dolmens are in Hisbone, and the most have been found at Zarqa Ma'in at Al-Murayghat, which are being destroyed by gravel quarries.\n\nIn Turkey, there are some dolmens in the Regions of Lalapasa and Suloglu in the Province of Edirne and the Regions of KOfcaz, Kirklareli and Demirkoy in the Province of  Kirklareli, in the Eastern Thrace. They have been studied by Prof. Dr. Engin Beksaç, since 2004. And also, some of so-called monuments are in the different regions of Anatolia, in Turkey.\n\nFile:Gochang Dolmen Sites - 3.JPG|Gochang Dolmen, a table-style dolmen, Korea\nFile:Dolmen Hongseong South Korea.JPG|Hongseong dolmen, a dissection-style dolmen, Korea\nFile:MarayoorDolmen.JPG|A dolmen erected by Neolithic people in Marayur, India\nFile:Dolmen circles, Sulimalthe, Somwarpet.jpg|Dolmen circles, Sulimalthe, Somwarpet\nFile:Muniyara.jpg|Dolmens of Marayoor in Kerala, India\nFile:Megalithic Dolmen at Dannanapeta 03.jpg|Megalithic Dolmen at Dannanapeta in Andhra Pradesh, India\nFile:Dolmen Russia r.Jane.JPG|Dolmen in the Zhane river valley, Russia\nFile:Dolmen Johfiyeh Jordan Ahmed Telfah 13January2010.jpg|Flint dolmen in Johfiyeh, Jordan\nFile:Dolmen in Johfiyeh Irbid north of Jordan Dec2009.jpg|Flint dolmen in Johfiyeh, Jordan\n\nAfrica \n\nHorn of Africa \n\nIn northern Somalia, the town of Aw Barkhadle, named in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn, is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are dolmens, burial mounds, menhirs (standing stones), and stelae.\n\nNorth Africa \n\nIn northern Tunisia, Dougga is an important ancient site, which contains a necropolis with dolmens. The settlement also features a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic stelae, the mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations.\n\nFile:GM Guelma Roknia01.jpg|Dolmen at Roknia, an ancient necropolis in the Guelma region of northeast Algeria; the site includes more than 7000 dolmens spread over an area of 2 km\n\nEurope \n\nOverview \n\nMegalithic tombs are found from the Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea coasts south to Spain and Portugal. Hunebedden are chamber tombs similar to dolmens and date to the middle Neolithic (Funnelbeaker culture, 4th millennium BC). They consist of a kerb surrounding an oval mound, which covered a rectangular chamber of stones with the entrance on one of the long sides. Some have a more complex layout and include an entrance passage giving them a T-shape. Various menhirs and dolmens are located around the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo. Pottery uncovered in these structures allowed the attribution of the monuments to the Ġgantija and Mnajdra temples culture of the early Neolithic Age.Journal of European Archaeology (JEA), 5 (1997); Emilia Pásztor and Curt Roslund: Orientation of Maltese dolmens.\n\nDolmen sites fringe the Irish Sea and are found in south-east Ireland, Wales, Devon and Cornwall. In Ireland, most dolmens are found on the west coast, particularly in Connemara and the Burren, which includes some of the better-known examples, such as Poulnabrone dolmen. Examples such as the Annadorn dolmen have also been found in Northern Ireland, where they may have co-existed with the court cairn tombs.\n\nIn Mecklenburg and Pomerania/Pomorze in Germany and Poland, Drenthe Netherlands, large numbers of these graves were disturbed when harbours, towns, and cities were built.The boulders were used in construction and road building. Others, such as the Harhoog, in Sylt, were moved to new locations. There are still many thousands left today in Europe.\n\nBy 2017, all the hunebedden in the Netherlands were put in a 3D atlas (accessible to the public for free) using photogrammetry. The data was obtained from a collaboration between the Province of Drenthe and the University of Groningen, subsidized by the Gratama Foundation.[https://sketchfab.com/gia/collections/de-hunebedden-in-nederland 3D atlas]\n\nSites \n\n*Bulgaria: There are interesting dolmens in the regions related to the Sakar and Rhodope and Strandzha Mountains in Bulgaria. There is also a dolmen in Horë-Vranisht, Albania. It is locally known as \"Guri me qiell\" (\"Stone in the sky\") or \"Sofra e Zotit\" (\"Table of the God\").\n*Channel Islands: Many examples appear on the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, such as La Pouquelaye de Faldouet, La Sergenté, and La Hougue des Géonnais. The term Houge derives from the Old Norse word haugr, meaning a mound or barrow. The most famous of these sites is La Hougue Bie, a 6,000-year-old neolithic site that sits inside a large mound; later a chapel was built on the top of the mound.\n*France: In France important megalithic zones are situated in Vendée, Quercy and in the south of France (Languedoc, Rouergue and Corsica).  Amongst the vast Neolithic collections of the Carnac stones in Brittany, several dozen dolmens are found. Across the country, several dolmens still stand, such as the ones of Passebonneau and des Gorces near Saint-Benoît-du-Sault.\n*Ireland: The largest dolmen in Europe is the Brownshill Dolmen in County Carlow, Ireland. Its capstone weighs about 150 tonnes.\n*Italy: In Italy dolmens can be found in Apulia, Sardinia and in Sicily. In this latter region there are small dolmens located in Mura Pregne (Palermo), Sciacca (Agrigento), Monte Bubbonia (Caltanissetta), Butera (Caltanissetta),  Cava dei Servi (Ragusa), Cava Lazzaro (Siracusa), Avola (Siracusa).Salvatore Piccolo, Ancient Stones, op. cit. In the area named Cava dei Servi was found an atypical dolmen, away from the trilithic characteristic shape; it's a semi-oval monument formed by four rectangular slabs fixed into the ground. Another three slabs are on top, leaning in such a way they reduce the surface and form a false dome; two large parallelepiped boulders complete the construction.Salvatore Piccolo, ibidem, pages 13 onwards.\n*Portugal: Dolmens can be found across Portugal, ranging from simple ones to more complex examples of megalithic architecture, such as the Almendres Cromlech or the Anta Grande do Zambujeiro.\n*Spain: In Spain dolmens can be found in Galicia (such as Axeitos), Basque Country and Navarre (like the Sorgin Etxea) and the basque name for them is Trikuharri or Jentiletxe, Catalonia (like Cova d'en Daina or Creu d'en Cobertella), Andalusia (like the Cueva de Menga) and Extremadura (like \"Dolmen de Lácara\").\n*United Kingdom: Lanyon Quoit is a dolmen in Cornwall, 2 mi southeast of Morvah. It stands next to the road leading from Madron to Morvah. The capstone rested at 7 ft high with dimensions of 9 by weighing 13.5 tons.\n\nFile:Dolmen Roch-Feutet.JPG|The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet in Carnac, Brittany, France\nFile:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|Crucuno dolmen in Plouharnel, Brittany, France\nFile:paulnabrone.jpg|Poulnabrone dolmen in the Burren, County Clare, Ireland\nFile:KilclooneyDolmen1986.jpg|Kilclooney More dolmen near Ardara, County Donegal, Ireland\nFile:LG Dolmen1.JPG|Lancken-Granitz dolmen, Germany\nFile:hunebed-d27.jpg|T-shaped Hunebed D27 in Borger-Odoorn, Netherlands\nFile:Antadaaboboreira.jpg|Dólmen da Aboboreira, Baião, Portugal\nFile:Dolmen di Avola.JPG|Dolmen of Avola, Sicily\nFile:Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg|Dolmen of Monte Bubbonia, Sicily\nFile:The Cava dei Servi dolmen (Ragusa-Sicily).jpg|Dolmen of Cava dei Servi, Sicily\nFile:Dolmen de Axeitos.jpg|Dolmen of Oleiros, Spain\nFile:Mores02.jpg|Dolmen Sa Coveccada, Mores, Sardinia\nFile:Cromlech at Enstone, Oxfordshire (p.124, Feb 1824).jpg|Cromlech at Enstone, Oxfordshire (p. 124, Feb 1824)\nFile:Plan of Cromlechs Near Kits Coty House, Kent (p.124, Feb 1824).jpg|Plan of Cromlechs Near Kits Coty House, Kent (p. 124, Feb 1824)",

Amongst the vast Neolithic collections of the Carnac stones in Brittany, several dozen dolmens are found. Across the country, several dolmens still stand, such as the ones of Passebonneau and des Gorces near Saint-Benoît-du-Sault.\n*Ireland: The largest dolmen in Europe is the Brownshill Dolmen in County Carlow, Ireland. Its capstone weighs about 150 tonnes.\n*Italy: In Italy dolmens can be found in Apulia, Sardinia and in Sicily. In this latter region there are small dolmens located in Mura Pregne (Palermo), Sciacca (Agrigento), Monte Bubbonia (Caltanissetta), Butera (Caltanissetta),  Cava dei Servi (Ragusa), Cava Lazzaro (Siracusa), Avola (Siracusa).Salvatore Piccolo, Ancient Stones, op. cit. In the area named Cava dei Servi was found an atypical dolmen, away from the trilithic characteristic shape; it's a semi-oval monument formed by four rectangular slabs fixed into the ground. Another three slabs are on top, leaning in such a way they reduce the surface and form a false dome; two large parallelepiped boulders complete the construction.Salvatore Piccolo, ibidem, pages 13 onwards.\n*Portugal: Dolmens can be found across Portugal, ranging from simple ones to more complex examples of megalithic architecture, such as the Almendres Cromlech or the Anta Grande do Zambujeiro.\n*Spain: In Spain dolmens can be found in Galicia (such as Axeitos), Basque Country and Navarre (like the Sorgin Etxea) and the basque name for them is Trikuharri or Jentiletxe, Catalonia (like Cova d'en Daina or Creu d'en Cobertella), Andalusia (like the Cueva de Menga) and Extremadura (like \"Dolmen de Lácara\").\n*United Kingdom: Lanyon Quoit is a dolmen in Cornwall, 2 mi southeast of Morvah. It stands next to the road leading from Madron to Morvah. The capstone rested at 7 ft high with dimensions of 9 by weighing 13.5 tons.\n\nFile:Dolmen Roch-Feutet.JPG|The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet in Carnac, Brittany, France\nFile:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|Crucuno dolmen in Plouharnel, Brittany, France\nFile:paulnabrone.jpg|Poulnabrone dolmen in the Burren, County Clare, Ireland\nFile:KilclooneyDolmen1986.jpg|Kilclooney More dolmen near Ardara, County Donegal, Ireland\nFile:LG Dolmen1.JPG|Lancken-Granitz dolmen, Germany\nFile:hunebed-d27.jpg|T-shaped Hunebed D27 in Borger-Odoorn, Netherlands\nFile:Antadaaboboreira.jpg|Dólmen da Aboboreira, Baião, Portugal\nFile:Dolmen di Avola.JPG|Dolmen of Avola, Sicily\nFile:Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg|Dolmen of Monte Bubbonia, Sicily\nFile:The Cava dei Servi dolmen (Ragusa-Sicily).jpg|Dolmen of Cava dei Servi, Sicily\nFile:Dolmen de Axeitos.jpg|Dolmen of Oleiros, Spain\nFile:Mores02.jpg|Dolmen Sa Coveccada, Mores, Sardinia\nFile:Cromlech at Enstone, Oxfordshire (p.124, Feb 1824).jpg|Cromlech at Enstone, Oxfordshire (p. 124, Feb 1824)\nFile:Plan of Cromlechs Near Kits Coty House, Kent (p.124, Feb 1824).jpg|Plan of Cromlechs Near Kits Coty House, Kent (p. 124, Feb 1824).
