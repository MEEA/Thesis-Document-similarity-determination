  "textBody" : "Daniel Clement Dennett III (born March 28, 1942) is an American philosopher, writer, and cognitive scientist whose research centers on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and philosophy of biology, particularly as those fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science.Beardsley, T. (1996) Profile: Daniel C. Dennett – Dennett's Dangerous Idea, Scientific American 274(2), 34–35.\n\nAs of 2017, he is the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies and the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University. Dennett is an atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board,, and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. Dennett is referred to as one of the \"Four Horsemen of New Atheism\", along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.\n\nDennett is a member of the editorial board for The Rutherford Journal.\n\nEarly life\n\nDennett was born on March 28, 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck) and Daniel Clement Dennett, Jr. Dennett spent part of his childhood in Lebanon, where, during World War II, his father was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attaché to the American Embassy in Beirut. When he was five, his mother took him back to Massachusetts after his father died in an unexplained plane crash. Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, \"You know what you are, Daniel? You're a philosopher.\"Dennett in conversation with Michio Kaku on [http://www.kpfa.org/exploration-67 Explorations] radio program (broadcast on KPFA-FM, Berkeley, California, June 12, 2012)\n\nDennett graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1959, and spent one year at Wesleyan University before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Harvard University in 1963.  At Harvard University he was a student of W. V. Quine. In 1965, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he studied under Gilbert Ryle and was a member of Hertford College. His dissertation was entitled \"The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality\".\n\nDennett describes himself as \"an autodidact—or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world's leading scientists\".\n\nHe is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/daniel-dennett American Scientist] He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.\n\nIn February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.\n\nIn 2012, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize, an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, \"for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience.\"\n\nPhilosophical views\n\nFree will\n\nWhile he is a confirmed compatibilist on free will, in \"On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want\"—Chapter 15 of his 1978 book Brainstorms,Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology, MIT Press (1978), pp. 286–299 Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to libertarian views.\n\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including William James, Henri Poincaré, Arthur Holly Compton, and Henry Margenau, Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\n\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as Robert Kane have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, character and values, and feelings and desires. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\n\nPhilosophy of mind\n\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in Brainchildren) that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in empirical research. In his original dissertation, Content and Consciousness, he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as Content and Consciousness has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided Brainstorms into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in The Intentional Stance and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in Consciousness Explained. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.\n\nIn chapter 5 of Consciousness Explained Dennett describes his multiple drafts model of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p. 111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something rather like a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p. 135, emphasis in the original).\n\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as Neural Darwinism. He also presents an argument against qualia; he argues that the concept is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\n\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms: \"[Others] note that my 'avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors.\"Daniel Dennett, The Message is: There is no Medium\n\nIn Consciousness Explained, he affirms \"I am a sort of 'teleofunctionalist', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist'\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of verificationist\".\n\nEvolutionary debate\n\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (Kinds of Minds), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (Freedom Evolves).\n\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an algorithmic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as long division often incorporate a significant degree of randomness).p. 52-60, Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (Simon & Schuster; reprint edition 1996) () This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\n\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly adaptationist, in line with his theory of the intentional stance, and the evolutionary views of biologist Richard Dawkins. In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould.  This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology, which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker.Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of \"greedy reductionism\", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by evolutionary psychology. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\" Gould, 1980. [http://www.ags.uci.edu/~mzyoung/p1.htm \"Sociobiology and the Theory of Natural Selection\"] In G. W. Barlow and J. Silverberg, eds., Sociobiology: Beyond Nature/Nurture? Boulder CO: Westview Press, pp. 257–269.  Strong disagreements have been launched against Dennett from Gould and his supporters, who allege that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's \"Darwinian fundamentalism\".[http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/Gould.html 'Evolution: The pleasures of Pluralism'] — Stephen Jay Gould's review of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, June 26, 1997\n\nDennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller.\n\nAn account of religion and morality\n\nIn Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects the idea of the naturalistic fallacy as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.\n\nIn his 2006 book, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.\nIn this book he declares himself to be \"a bright\", and defends the term.\n\nHe has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a \"Don't ask, don't tell\" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual.[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP08122150.pdf Preachers who are not Believers (PDF)], Evolutionary Psychology, Vol. 8, Issue 1, March 2010, pp. 122–50, (). The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics.[http://traffic.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_247_011511.mp3 Podcast: interview with Daniel Dennett. Further developments of the research: pastors, priests, and an Imam who are closet atheists]. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind.\n\nOther philosophical views\n\nHe has also written about and advocated the notion of memetics as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his \"Brains, Computers, and Minds\", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.\n\nDennett has been critical of postmodernism, having said: Postmodernism, the school of \"thought\" that proclaimed \"There are no truths, only interpretations\" has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for \"conversations\" in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.DENNETT ON WIESELTIER V. PINKER IN THE NEW REPUBLIC http://edge.org/conversation/dennett-on-wieseltier-v-pinker-in-the-new-republic\n\nDennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term \"deepity\", originally coined by Miriam WeizenbaumDennett, Daniel. Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking.  W. W. Norton & Company, 2013 p.56 (daughter of computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum). Dennett used \"deepity\" for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are \"Que sera sera!\", \"Beauty is only skin deep!\", \"The power of intention can transform your life.\" The term has been cited many times.\nArtificial Intelligence \n\nWhile approving of the increase in efficiency that human reap by using  artifacts such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett sees a danger in machines performing an ever increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory and algorithmic computation because humans are likely to be encouraged to anthropomorphize and attribute intellectual powers to machines that they do not in fact possess.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 402 He believes the relevant danger from AI is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically \"parasitic\" AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user's powers of comprehension.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.402-403 \n\nAs given in his most recent book, From Bacteria to Bach and Back, Dennett's views stand in contradistinction to those of Nick Bostrom.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 400  Although acknowledging that it is  \"possible in principle\" to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such \"strong AI\" project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. p164-5 and 399-400 According to Dennett, the prospect of superintelligence (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) is at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.399-400\n\nPersonal life\n\nDennett married Susan Bell in 1962.http://faculty.fullerton.edu/cmcconnell/491/AP/Dennett.html They live in North Andover, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, a son, and five grandchildren.\n\nDennett is an avid sailor.\n\nSelected works\n\n* Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology (MIT Press 1981) ()\n* Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting (MIT Press 1984) — on free will and determinism ()\n* The Mind's I (Bantam, Reissue edition 1985, with Douglas Hofstadter) ()\n* Content and Consciousness (Routledge & Kegan Paul Books Ltd; 2nd ed.
