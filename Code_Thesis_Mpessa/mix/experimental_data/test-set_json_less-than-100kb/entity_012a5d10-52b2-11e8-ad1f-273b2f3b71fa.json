  "textBody" : "The Göktürks, Celestial Turks, Blue Turks or Kok Turks (Old Turkic: 𐰜𐰇𐰛:𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰, Kök Türük , ; Khotanese Saka Ttūrka, Ttrūka, Old Tibetan Drugu), were a nomadic confederation of Turkic peoples in medieval Inner Asia. The Göktürks, under the leadership of Bumin Qaghan (d. 552) and his sons, succeeded the Rouran Khaganate as the main power in the region and established the Turkic Khaganate, one of several nomadic dynasties which would shape the future geolocation, culture, and dominant beliefs of Turkic peoples.\n\nEtymology\n\nStrictly speaking, the common name Göktürk is the Anatolian Turkish form of the ethnonym. The Old Turkic name for the Göktürks was 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰  Türük,[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang\ne&mod1&tid\n1&oid15&m\n1 Kultegin's Memorial Complex, Türik Bitig] Orkhon inscriptions[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang\ne&mod1&tid\n1&oid16&m\n1 Bilge Kagan's Memorial Complex, Türik Bitig] 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰:𐰜𐰇𐰛 Kök Türük, or  Türk.[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang\ne&mod1&tid\n1&oid17&m\n1 Tonyukuk's Memorial Complex, Türik Bitig] Bain Tsokto inscriptions They were known in Middle Chinese historical sources as the tɦutkyat (). According to Chinese sources, the meaning of the word Tujue was \"combat helmet\" (), reportedly because the shape of the Altai Mountains where they lived, was similar to a combat helmet.Linghu Defen et al., Book of Zhou, Vol. 50. Wei Zheng et al., Book of Sui, Vol. 84. Li Yanshou (李延寿), History of the Northern Dynasties, Vol. 99. \n\nGöktürk means \"Celestial Turks\", or sometimes \"Blue Turks\" (i.e. because sky blue is associated with celestial realms).  This is consistent with \"the cult of heavenly ordained rule\" which was a recurrent element of Altaic political culture and as such may have been imbibed by the Göktürks from their predecessors in Mongolia.Wink 64. The name of the ruling Ashina clan may derive from the Khotanese Saka term for \"deep blue\", āššɪna.\n\nThe word Türk meant \"strong\" in Old Turkic.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Göktürk rulers originated from the Ashina clan, who were first attested to 439. The Book of Sui reports that in that year, on October 18, the Tuoba ruler Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei overthrew Juqu Mujian of the Northern Liang in eastern Gansu,Wei Shou, Book of Wei, Vol. 4-I. Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 123. 永和七年 (太延五年) 九月丙戌 [http://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/ Academia Sinica]  whence 500 Ashina families fled northwest to the Rouran Khaganate in the vicinity of Gaochang.Christian, p. 249. Peter Benjamin Golden points out the possibility that the khaghans of the Turkic Khaganate, the Ashina, were themselves originally Indo-Europeans (possibly Iranian peoples) who later adopted the Turkic language but continued to use titles from their earlier Indo-European languages.Peter B. Golden, An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples, O. Harrassowitz, 1992, p. 121–122 German Turkologist W.-E. Scharlipp points out that many common terms in Turkic are Iranian in origin.„(...) Über die Ethnogenese dieses Stammes ist viel gerätselt worden. Auffallend ist, dass viele zentrale Begriffe iranischen Ursprungs sind. Dies betrifft fast alle Titel (...). Einige Gelehrte wollen auch die Eigenbezeichnung türk auf einen iranischen Ursprung zurückführen und ihn mit dem Wort „Turan“, der persischen Bezeichnung für das Land jeneseits des Oxus, in Verbindung bringen.“ Wolfgang-Ekkehard Scharlipp in Die frühen Türken in Zentralasien, p. 18\n\nAccording to the Book of Zhou and the History of the Northern Dynasties, the Ashina clan was a component of the Xiongnu confederation, but this connection is disputed,Christian, p. 249 and according to the Book of Sui and the Tongdian, they were \"mixed Hu (barbarians)\" () from Pingliang.杜佑, 《通典》, 北京: 中華書局出版, (Du You, Tongdian, Vol.197), 辺防13 北狄4 突厥上, 1988, , p. 5401.  Indeed, Chinese sources linked the Hu on their northern borders to the Xiongnu just as Graeco-Roman historiographers called the Pannonian Avars, Huns and Hungarians \"Scythians\". Such archaizing was a common literary topos, and implied similar geographic origins and nomadic lifestyle but not direct filiation.\n\nAs part of the heterogeneous Rouran Khaganate, the Türks lived for generations north of the Altai Mountains, where they 'engaged in metal working for the Rouran'.Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 159.  According to Denis Sinor, the rise to power of the Ashina clan represented an 'internal revolution' in the Rouran Khaganate rather than an external conquest. According to Charles Holcombe, the early Tujue population was rather heterogeneous and many of the names of Türk rulers, including the two founding members, are not even Turkic. This is supported by evidence from the Orkhon inscriptions, which include several non-Turkic lexemes, possibly representing Finno-Ugric or Samoyedic words.\n\nExpansion\n\nAfter the collapse of China's Sui dynasty, the Göktürks intervened in the ensuing civil wars, providing support to the northeastern rebel Liu Heita against the rising Tang in 622 and 623. He enjoyed a long string of success but was finally routed by Li Shimin and other Tang generals and executed.  On May 19, 639貞觀十三年 四月戊寅 [http://db1x.sinica.edu.tw/sinocal/ Academia Sinica]   Ashina Jiesheshuai and his tribesmen directly assaulted Emperor Taizong of Tang at Jiucheng Palace (, in present-day Linyou County, Baoji, Shaanxi). However, they did not succeed and fled to the north, but were caught by pursuers near the Wei River and were killed. Ashina Hexiangu was exiled to Lingbiao.Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 195.
