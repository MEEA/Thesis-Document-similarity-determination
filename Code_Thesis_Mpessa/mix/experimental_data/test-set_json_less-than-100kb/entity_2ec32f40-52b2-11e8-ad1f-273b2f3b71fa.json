Lambda is related to the Phoenician letter Lamed . Letters in other alphabets that stemmed from lambda include the Latin L and the Cyrillic letter El (Л, л). The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as () in Classical Greek times.Herbert Weir Smyth. A Greek Grammar for Colleges. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007 I.1.c] In Modern Greek the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced; the spoken letter itself has the sound of \"\" as with Latinate \"L\".\n\nIn early Greek alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied. Most variants consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at their ends.  The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left (\"Western\" alphabets), or top (\"Eastern\" alphabets). Other variants had a vertical line with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. With the general adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the Romans put the angle at the lower-left.\n\nThe HTML 4 character entity references for the Greek capital and small letter lambda are \"Λ\" and \"λ\", respectively.World Wide Web Consortium W3C.
