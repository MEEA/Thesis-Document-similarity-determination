  "textBody" : "Jule Styne (; December 31, 1905 - September 20, 1994) was a British-American song writer and composer known for a series of Broadway musicals, which include several famous and frequently revived shows.\n\nEarly life\n\nStyne was born to a Jewish family in London, England as Julius Kerwin Stein to immigrants from Ukraine, the Russian Empire who ran a small grocery. At the age of eight, he moved with his family to Chicago, where at an early age he began taking piano lessons. He proved to be a prodigy and performed with the Chicago, St. Louis, and Detroit Symphonies before he was ten years old.\n\nCareer\n\nStyne attended Chicago Musical College, but before then, he had already attracted attention of another teenager, Mike Todd, later a successful film producer, who commissioned him to write a song for a musical act that he was creating. It was the first of over 1,500 published songs Styne composed in his career. His first hit, \"Sunday\", was written in 1926. In 1929, Styne was playing with the Ben Pollack band.\n\nStyne was a vocal coach for 20th Century Fox, until Darryl F. Zanuck fired him because vocal coaching was \"a luxury, and we're cutting out those luxuries\", and told him he should write songs, because \"that's forever\". Styne established his own dance band, which brought him to the notice of Hollywood, where he was championed by Frank Sinatra and where he began a collaboration with lyricist Sammy Cahn. He and Cahn wrote many songs for the movies, including \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" (#1 for 3 weeks for Harry James and His Orchestra in 1945), \"Five Minutes More,\" and the Oscar-winning title song for Three Coins in the Fountain (1954). He collaborated on the score for the 1955 musical film My Sister Eileen with Leo Robin. Ten of his songs were nominated for the Oscar, many written with Cahn, including \"I've Heard That Song Before\" (#1 for 13 weeks for Harry James and His Orchestra in 1943), \"I'll Walk Alone\", \"It's Magic\" (a #2 hit for Doris Day in 1948), and \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\".\n\nIn 1947, Styne wrote his first score for a Broadway musical, High Button Shoes, with Cahn, and over the next several decades wrote the scores for many Broadway shows, most notably Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Peter Pan (additional music), Bells Are Ringing, Gypsy, Do Re Mi, Funny Girl, Sugar (with a story based on the movie Some Like It Hot, but all new music), and the Tony-winning Hallelujah, Baby!.\n\nStyne wrote original music for the short-lived, themed amusement park Freedomland U.S.A. which opened on June 19, 1960.\n\nHis collaborators included Sammy Cahn, Leo Robin, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Stephen Sondheim, and Bob Merrill.\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life for British television in 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in New York’s Time Square.\n\nStyne died of heart failure in New York City at the age of 88. His archive - including original hand-written compositions, letters, and production materials - is housed at the Harry Ransom Center.\n\nAwards\n\nStyne was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972 and the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981, and he was a recipient of a Drama Desk Special Award and the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990. Additionally, Styne won the 1955 Oscar for Best Music, Original Song for \"Three Coins in the Fountain\", and \"Hallelujah, Baby!\" won the 1968 Tony Award for Best Original Score.\n\nSongs\n\nA selection of the many songs that Styne wrote:\n* \"The Christmas Waltz\"\n* \"Conchita Marquita Lolita Pepita Rosita Juanita Lopez\"\n* \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" (from Funny Girl)\n* \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" (from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes)\n* \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\" (from Gypsy)\n* \"Every Street's a Boulevard in Old New York\" (from Hazel Flagg)\n* \"Fiddle Dee Dee\"\n* \"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\"\n* \"How Do You Speak To An Angel\"\n* \"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\"\n* \"I Fall In Love Too Easily\" (from Anchors Aweigh)\n* \"I Still Get Jealous\"\n* \"I'll Walk Alone\"\n* \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\"\n* \"It's Magic\" (from Romance on the High Seas)\n* \"It's You or No One\"\n* \"I've Heard That Song Before\"\n* \"Just In Time\" (from Bells Are Ringing)\n* \"Let Me Entertain You\" (from Gypsy)\n* \"Let It Snow!
