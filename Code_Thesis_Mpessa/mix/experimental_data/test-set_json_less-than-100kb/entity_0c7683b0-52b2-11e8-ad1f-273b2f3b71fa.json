  "textBody" : "Helsinki (; shortened to Hki,; ;) is the capital and largest city of Finland. Helsinki is the seat of the region of Uusimaa in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of  and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located 80 km north of Tallinn, Estonia, 400 km east of Stockholm, Sweden and 390 km west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities.\n\nThe Helsinki metropolitan area includes the urban core of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen and surrounding commuter towns. It is the world's northernmost metro area of over one million people, and the city is the northernmost capital of an EU member state. Helsinki is the third largest city in the Nordic countries, after Stockholm and Oslo. Helsinki is Finland's major political, educational, financial, cultural and research center. The neighboring city of Vantaa is the location of Helsinki Airport, which has frequent service to various destinations in Europe and Asia.\n\nHelsinki was the World Design Capital for 2012, the venue for the 1952 Summer Olympics and the host of the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nHelsinki has some of the highest standards of living of a city in the world. In 2011, British magazine Monocle ranked Helsinki the world's most liveable city in its Liveable Cities Index. In the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2016 Liveability Survey, Helsinki scored ninth place among 140 cities.[https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid\nliveability2016 2016 Global Liveability Ranking]\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to a theory presented in the 1630s, settlers from Hälsingland in central Sweden had arrived to what is now known as the Vantaa River and called it Helsingå (\"Helsinge River\"), which gave rise to the names of Helsinge village and church in the 1300s. This theory is questionable, because dialect research suggests that the settlers arrived from Uppland and nearby areas. Others have proposed the name as having been derived from the Swedish word helsing, an archaic form of the word hals (neck), referring to the narrowest part of a river, the rapids. Other Scandinavian cities at similar geographic locations were given similar names at the time, e.g. Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden.\n\nWhen a town was founded in Forsby village in 1548, it was named Helsinge fors, \"Helsinge rapids\". The name refers to the Vanhankaupunginkoski rapids at the mouth of the river. The town was commonly known as Helsinge or Helsing, from which the contemporary Finnish name arose.\n\nOfficial Finnish Government documents and Finnish language newspapers have used the name Helsinki since 1819, when the Senate of Finland moved itself into the city from Turku. The decrees issued in Helsinki were dated with Helsinki as the place of issue. This is how the form Helsinki came to be used in written Finnish. As part of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire, Helsinki was known as Gelsingfors in Russian.\n\nIn Helsinki slang, the city is called Stadi (from the Swedish word stad, meaning \"city\"). Hesa (short for Helsinki), is not used by natives of the city.Ristkari, Maiju: Heinäsorsat Helsingissä. Aku Ankka #44/2013, introduction on page 2. ' is the Northern Sami name of Helsinki.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history \n\nIn the Iron Age the area occupied by present day Helsinki was inhabited by Tavastians. They used the area for fishing and hunting, for example, but due to lack of archeological finds it is difficult to say how extensive their settlements were. Pollen analysis has shown that there were cultivating settlements in the area in the 10th century and surviving historical records from the 14th century describe Tavastian settlements in the area.\n\nSwedes colonised the coastline of the Helsinki region in late 13th century after the successful Second Crusade to Finland, which lead to the defeat of the Tavastians.\n\nFounding of Helsinki \n\nHelsinki was established as a trading town by King Gustav I of Sweden in 1550 as the town of Helsingfors, which he intended to be a rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today known as Tallinn). Little came of the plans as Helsinki remained a tiny town plagued by poverty, wars, and diseases. The plague of 1710 killed the greater part of the inhabitants of Helsinki. The construction of the naval fortress Sveaborg (In Finnish Viapori, today also Suomenlinna) in the 18th century helped improve Helsinki's status, but it was not until Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 that the town began to develop into a substantial city. During the war, Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress, and about one quarter of the town was destroyed in an 1808 fire.\n\nRussian Emperor Alexander I of Russia moved the Finnish capital from Turku to Helsinki in 1812 to reduce Swedish influence in Finland, and to bring the capital closer to Saint Petersburg. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, the Royal Academy of Turku, at the time the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki, and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in neoclassical style to resemble Saint Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect C. L. Engel. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and industrialization were key factors behind the city's growth.\n\nTwentieth century\n\nDespite the tumultuous nature of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century (including the Finnish Civil War and the Winter War which both left marks on the city), Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the 1952 Olympic Games, held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the Helsinki Metro subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth.\n\nGeography\n\nCalled the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Helsinki is on the tip of a peninsula and on 315 islands. The inner city is located on a southern peninsula, Helsinginniemi (”Helsinki’s peninsula”), which is rarely referred to by its actual name, Vironniemi (”Estonia’s peninsula”). Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is very high, reaching 16494 PD/km2 in the district of Kallio, but as a whole Helsinki's population density of 3050 /km2 ranks the city as rather sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities. Much of Helsinki outside the inner city area is postwar suburbs separated by patches of forest. A narrow,  long Helsinki Central Park, stretching from the inner city to Helsinki's northern border is an important recreational area for residents. The City of Helsinki has about 11,000 boat berths and possesses over 14,000 hectares of marine fishing waters adjacent to the Capital Region. Some 60 fish species are found in this area and recreational fishing is popular.\n\nMajor islands in Helsinki include Seurasaari, Vallisaari, Lauttasaari, and Korkeasaari – the lattermost being the site of Finland’s largest zoo. Other noteworthy islands are the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg), the military island of Santahamina, and Isosaari. Pihlajasaari island is a favorite summer spot for gay men and naturists, comparable to Fire Island in New York City.\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nThe Helsinki metropolitan area, also known as the Capital Region (Finnish: Pääkaupunkiseutu, Swedish: Huvudstadsregionen) comprises four municipalities: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. The Helsinki urban area is considered to be the only metropolis in Finland. It has a population of over 1,1 million, and is the most densely populated area of Finland. The Capital Region spreads over a land area of  and has a population density of . With over 20 percent of the country's population in just 0.2 percent of its surface area, the area's housing density is high by Finnish standards.\n\nThe Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Greater Helsinki) consists of the cities of Helsinki Capital Region and ten surrounding municipalities. The Metropolitan Area covers 3697 km2 and has a population of over 1.4 million, or about a fourth of the total population of Finland. The metropolitan area has a high concentration of employment: approximately 750,000 jobs. Despite the intensity of land use, the region also has large recreational areas and green spaces. The Greater Helsinki area is the world's northernmost urban area with a population of over one million people, and the northernmost EU capital city.\n\nThe Helsinki urban area is an officially recognized urban area in Finland, defined by its population density. The area stretches throughout 11 municipalities, and is the largest such area in Finland, with a land area of  and approximately 1,2 million inhabitants.\n\nClimate\n\nHelsinki has a humid continental climate (Dfb). Owing to the mitigating influence of the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic Current (see also Extratropical cyclone), temperatures during the winter are higher than the northern location might suggest, with the average in January and February around .\n\nWinters in Helsinki are notably warmer than in the north of Finland, and the snow season is much shorter in the capital. Temperatures below  occur at most a few times a year. However, because of the latitude, days last 5 hours and 48 minutes around the winter solstice with very low Sun (at noon, the Sun is a little bit over 6 degrees in the sky), and the cloudy weather at this time of year exacerbates darkness. Conversely, Helsinki enjoys long daylight during the summer; during the summer solstice, days last 18 hours and 57 minutes.\n\nThe average maximum temperature from June to August is around 19 to. Due to the marine effect, especially during hot summer days, daily temperatures are a little cooler and night temperatures higher than further inland. The highest temperature ever recorded in the city centre was , on 18 July 1945, and the lowest was , on 10 January 1987. Helsinki Airport (in Vantaa,  north of the Helsinki city centre) recorded a temperature of , on 29 July 2010, and a low of , on 9 January 1987. Precipitation is received from frontal passages and thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are most common in the summer.\n\nCityscape\n\nCarl Ludvig Engel, appointed to plan a new city centre on his own, designed several neoclassical buildings in Helsinki. The focal point of Engel's city plan was the Senate Square. It is surrounded by the Government Palace (to the east), the main building of Helsinki University (to the west), and (to the north) the large Cathedral, which was finished in 1852, twelve years after Engel's death. Helsinki's epithet \"The White City of the North\" derives from this construction era.\n\nHelsinki is also home to numerous Art Nouveau-influenced (Jugend in Finnish) buildings belonging to the romantic nationalism trend, designed in the early 20th century and strongly influenced by Kalevala, which was a common theme of the era. Helsinki's Art Nouveau style is also featured in central residential districts, such as Katajanokka and Ullanlinna. An important architect of the Finnish Art Nouveau style was Eliel Saarinen, whose architectural masterpiece was the Helsinki Central Station.\n\nHelsinki also features several buildings by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, recognized as one of the pioneers of architectural functionalism. However, some of his works, such as the headquarters of the paper company Stora Enso and the concert venue Finlandia Hall, have been subject to divided opinions from the citizens.\n\nFunctionalist buildings in Helsinki by other architects include the Olympic Stadium, the Tennis Palace, the Rowing Stadium, the Swimming Stadium, the Velodrome, the Glass Palace, the Töölö Sports Hall, and Helsinki-Malmi Airport. The sports venues were built to serve the 1940 Helsinki Olympic Games; the games were initially cancelled due to the Second World War, but the venues fulfilled their purpose in the 1952 Olympic Games. Many of them are listed by DoCoMoMo as significant examples of modern architecture. The Olympic Stadium and Helsinki-Malmi Airport are also catalogued by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities as cultural-historical environments of national significance.\n\nHelsinki's neoclassical buildings were often used as a backdrop for scenes set to take place in the Soviet Union in many Cold War era Hollywood movies, when filming in the USSR was not possible. Some of them include The Kremlin Letter (1970), Reds (1981), and Gorky Park (1983). Because some streetscapes were reminiscent of Leningrad's and Moscow's old buildings, they too were used in movie productions. At the same time the government secretly instructed Finnish officials not to extend assistance to such film projects.Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Political Department:  \n\nIn the 21st century Helsinki has decided to allow the construction of skyscrapers. As of April 2017 there are no skyscrapers taller than 100 meters in the Helsinki area, but there are several projects under construction or planning, mainly in Pasila and Kalasatama. An international architecture competition for at least 10 high-rises to be built in Pasila is being held. Construction of the towers will start before 2020. In Kalasatama, the first 35-story (130 m) and 32-story (122 m) residential towers are already under construction. Later they will be joined by a 37-story (140 metres), two 32-story (122 metres, 400 feet), 31-story (120 metres), and 27-story (100 metres) residential buildings. In the Kalasatama area, there will be about 15 high-rises within 10 years.\n\nGovernment\n\nAs is the case in all Finnish municipalities, the city council is the main decision-making organ in local politics, dealing with issues such as city planning, schools, health care, and public transport. The council is elected every four years.\n\nThe City Council of Helsinki consists of eighty-five members. Following the most recent municipal elections in 2017, the three largest parties are the National Coalition Party (25), the Green League (21), and the Social Democrats (12).\n\nThe Mayor of Helsinki is Jan Vapaavuori.\n\nDemographics\n\nAt 53 percent, Helsinki has a higher proportion of women than the national average, 51 percent. Helsinki's current population density of 2,739.36 people per square kilometre makes Helsinki the densest city in Finland. Life expectancy for men and women is slightly below the national averages: 75.1 years for men as compared to 75.7 years, 81.7 years for women as compared to 82.5 years.\n\nHelsinki has experienced strong growth since the 1810s, when it replaced Turku as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland, which later became the sovereign Republic of Finland. The city continued to show strong growth from that time onward, with an exception during the Finnish Civil War. From the end of World War II up until the 1970s there was a massive exodus of people from the countryside to the cities of Finland, in particular Helsinki. Between 1944 and 1969 the population of the city nearly doubled from 275,000 to 525,600.\n\nIn the 1960s, the population growth of Helsinki proper began to decrease, mainly due to a lack of housing. Many residents began to move to neighbouring Espoo and Vantaa, resulting in increased population growth in both municipalities. Espoo's population increased ninefold in sixty years, from 22,874 people in 1950 to 244,353 in 2009. Vantaa saw an even more dramatic change in the same time span: from 14,976 in 1950 to 197,663 in 2009, a thirteenfold increase. These increases pushed the municipalities of Greater Helsinki into more intense cooperation in such areas as public transportation – resulting in the foundation of HSL – and waste management. The increasing scarcity of housing and the higher costs of living in the Capital Region have pushed many daily commuters to find housing in formerly rural areas, and even further, to cities such as Lohja (50 km northwest from central Helsinki), Hämeenlinna and Lahti (both 100 km from Helsinki), and Porvoo (50 km east of Helsinki).\n\nLanguage \n\nFinnish and Swedish are the official languages of the municipality of Helsinki. The majority, or 81.9% of the population, speaks Finnish as their native language. A minority, at 5.9%, speaks Swedish. Around 12.2% of the population speaks a native language other than Finnish or Swedish. Helsinki slang today combines influences mainly from Finnish and English, but has traditionally had strong Russian and Swedish influences. Finnish today is the common language of communication between Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages (New Finns) in day-to-day affairs in the public sphere between unknown persons. In instances where a speaker's knowledge of Finnish is not known, English is usually spoken. Swedish is commonly spoken in city or national agencies specifically aimed at Finland-Swedish speakers, such as the Social Services Department on Hämeentie or the Luckan Cultural centre in Kamppi. Knowledge of Finnish is also essential in business and is usually a basic requirement in the employment market.\n\nFinnish speakers surpassed Swedish speakers in 1890 to become the majority of the city's population. At the time, the population of Helsinki was 61,530.\n\nImmigration\n\nHelsinki is the global gateway to and from Finland. The city has Finland's largest immigrant population in both absolute and relative terms. There are over 140 nationalities represented in Helsinki. The largest groups () are from Sweden, Russia, Estonia, Somalia, China, Iraq, Spain, Germany, France, Vietnam, and Turkey. Helsinki was already an international city in the 19th century with a distinctive Swedish majority as well as Finnish, Russian, and German minorities.\n\nForeign citizens make up 8.0% of the population, while the total foreign-born population makes up 11.1%. In 2012, 68,375 residents spoke a native language other than Finnish, Swedish, or one of the three Sami languages spoken in Finland. The largest groups of residents not of Finnish background come from Russia (14,532), Estonia (9,065), and Somalia (6,845). Half of the immigrant population in Finland lives in Greater Helsinki, and one third in the city of Helsinki.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Helsinki Metropolitan Area generates approximately one third of Finland's GDP. GDP per capita is roughly 1.3 times the national average.\n\nThe metropolitan area's gross value added per capita is 200% of the mean of 27 European metropolitan areas, equalling those of Stockholm or Paris. The gross value added annual growth has been around 4%.\n\n83 of the 100 largest Finnish companies have their headquarters in Greater Helsinki. Two-thirds of the 200 highest-paid Finnish executives live in Greater Helsinki and 42% in Helsinki. The average income of the top 50 earners was 1.65 million euro.\n\nThe tap water is of excellent quality and it is supplied by 120 km long Päijänne Water Tunnel, one of the world's longest continuous rock tunnels. Bottled Helsinki tap water is even sold to other countries, such as Saudi Arabia.[http://www.finnfacts.com/english/main/actualities/pullovesi.htm ] \n\nReligion\n\nThe Temppeliaukio Church is a Lutheran church in the Töölö neighborhood of the city. The church was designed by architects and brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen and opened in 1969. Built directly into solid rock, it is also known as the Church of the Rock and Rock Church.\"[http://www.muuka.com/finnishpumpkin/churches/helsinki/chteh/church_chteh.html Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki]\", Retrieved 5 September 2012.\n\nEducation\n\nHelsinki has 190 comprehensive schools, 41 upper secondary schools, and 15 vocational institutes. Half of the 41 upper secondary schools are private or state-owned, the other half municipal. Higher level education is given in eight universities (see the section \"Universities\" below) and four polytechnics.\n\nUniversities\n\n*University of Helsinki\n*Aalto University\n*Hanken School of Economics\n*University of the Arts Helsinki\n*National Defence University\n\nUniversities of Applied Sciences\n\n*Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences\n*Laurea University of Applied Sciences\n*Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences\n*Arcada University of Applied Sciences\n*Diaconia University of Applied Sciences\n\nHelsinki is one of the co-location centres of the Knowledge and Innovation Community (Future information and communication society) of The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).\n\nThe educational department takes part in Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 in Finland.\n\nCulture\n\nMuseums\n\nThe biggest historical museum in Helsinki is the National Museum of Finland, which displays a vast historical collection from prehistoric times to the 21st century. The museum building itself, a national romantic style neomedieval castle, is a tourist attraction. Another major historical museum is the Helsinki City Museum, which introduces visitors to Helsinki's 500-year history. The University of Helsinki also has many significant museums, including the Helsinki University Museum \"Arppeanum\" and the Finnish Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe Finnish National Gallery consists of three museums: Ateneum Art Museum for classical Finnish art, Sinebrychoff Art Museum for classical European art, and Kiasma Art Museum for modern art, in a building by architect Steven Holl. The old Ateneum, a neo-Renaissance palace from the 19th century, is one of the city's major historical buildings. All three museum buildings are state-owned through Senate Properties.\n\nThe city of Helsinki hosts its own art collection in the Helsinki Art Museum (HAM), primarily located in its Tennispalatsi gallery. Pieces outside of Tennispalatsi include about 200 public art pieces and all art held in property owned by the city.\n\nThe Design Museum is devoted to the exhibition of both Finnish and foreign design, including industrial design, fashion, and graphic design. Other museums in Helsinki include the Military Museum of Finland, Didrichsen Art Museum, Amos Anderson Art Museum, and the Tram Museum.\n\nFile:Helsinki July 2013-26a.jpg|Classical art museum Ateneum (1887)\nHelsinki Kiasma.jpg|Kiasma museum of contemporary art (1998)\n140811Ha001.jpg|Sinebrychoff Art Museum (1842)\nFile:Helsinki Art Museum entrance 01.JPG|Helsinki Art Museum (1968)\nDesignmuseo I Helsinki.jpg|The Design Museum (1894)\nNational Museum of Finland.jpg|The National Museum of Finland (1910)\nTram museum in Helsinki-7152.jpg|Tram museum (Ratikkamuseo) (1900)\nSotakorkeakoulu.jpg|The Military Museum of Finland (1881)\nTaidehalli Helsinki.jpg|Kunsthalle Helsinki art venue (1928)\nHelsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|The Finnish Museum of Natural History (1913)\nDidrichsenin taidemuseo.jpg|Didrichsen Art Museum (1964)\nYrjönkatu 27-29.jpg|Amos Anderson Art Museum (1913)\nArppeanum - DSC05409.JPG|Helsinki University Museum \"Arppeanum\" (1869)\n\nTheatres\n\nHelsinki has three major theatres: The Finnish National Theatre, the Helsinki City Theatre, and the Swedish Theatre (Svenska Teatern). Other notable theatres in the city include the Alexander Theatre, Q-teatteri, Savoy Theatre, KOM-theatre, and Teatteri Jurkka.\n\nMusic\n\nHelsinki is home to two full-size symphony orchestras, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, both of which perform at the Helsinki Music Centre concert hall. Acclaimed contemporary composers Kaija Saariaho, Magnus Lindberg, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and Einojuhani Rautavaara, among others, were born and raised in Helsinki, and studied at the Sibelius Academy. The Finnish National Opera, the only full-time, professional opera company in Finland, is located in Helsinki. The opera singer Martti Wallén, one of the company's long-time soloists, was born and raised in Helsinki, as was mezzo-soprano Monica Groop.\n\nMany widely renowned and acclaimed bands have originated in Helsinki, including Hanoi Rocks, HIM, Stratovarius, The 69 Eyes, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Wintersun, The Rasmus, Poets of the Fall, and Apocalyptica.\n\nThe city's main musical venues are the Finnish National Opera, the Finlandia concert hall, and the Helsinki Music Centre. The Music Centre also houses a part of the Sibelius Academy. Bigger concerts and events are usually held at one of the city's two big ice hockey arenas: the Hartwall Arena or the Helsinki Ice Hall. Helsinki has Finland's largest fairgrounds, the Messukeskus Helsinki.\n\nHelsinki Arena hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, the first Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Finland, following Lordi's win in 2006.\n\nArt\n\nThe Helsinki Festival is an annual arts and culture festival, which takes place every August (including the Night of the Arts).\n\nVappu is an annual carnival for students and workers.\n\nAt the Senate Square in September / October 2010, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Finland took place: About 1.4 million people saw the international exhibition of United Buddy Bears.\n\nHelsinki is the 2012 World Design Capital, in recognition of the use of design as an effective tool for social, cultural, and economic development in the city. In choosing Helsinki, the World Design Capital selection jury highlighted Helsinki's use of 'Embedded Design', which has tied design in the city to innovation, \"creating global brands, such as Nokia, Kone, and Marimekko, popular events, like the annual Helsinki Design Week, outstanding education and research institutions, such as the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, and exemplary architects and designers such as Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto\".\n\nHelsinki also hosts many film festivals. Most of them are small venues, but some have gained renown even abroad. The most prolific would be the Love & Anarchy film festival (also known as Helsinki International Film Festival), which features films on a wide spectrum. Night Visions, on the other hand, focuses on genre cinema, screening horror, fantasy, and science fiction films in very popular movie marathons that take whole night. Another popular film festival is DocPoint, a festival that focuses solely on documentary cinema.\n\nMedia\n\nToday, there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, 67 commercial radio stations, three digital radio channels, and one nationwide and five national public service radio channels.\n\nEach year, around 12,000 book titles are published and 12 million records are sold across Finland.\n\nSanoma publishes the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (its circulation of 412,000 making it the largest), the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, the commerce-oriented Taloussanomat, and the television channel Nelonen. The other major publisher Alma Media publishes over thirty magazines, including the newspaper Aamulehti, tabloid Iltalehti, and commerce-oriented Kauppalehti. Worldwide, Finns, along with other Nordic peoples and the Japanese, spend the most time reading newspapers.\n\nYle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels in both national languages. Headquartered in the neighbourhood of Pasila, Yle is funded through a mandatory television license and fees for private broadcasters. All TV channels are broadcast digitally, both terrestrially and on cable. The commercial television channel MTV3 and commercial radio channel Radio Nova are owned by Nordic Broadcasting (Bonnier and Proventus Industrier).\n\n, around 79% of the Finnish population uses the Internet. Finland had around 1.52 million broadband Internet connections by the end of June 2007 or around 287 per 1,000 inhabitants. All Finnish schools and public libraries have Internet connections and computers, and most residents have a mobile phone. Value-added services are rare. In October 2009, Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications committed to ensuring that every person in Finland would be able to access the Internet at a minimum speed of one megabit-per-second beginning July 2010.\n\nSports\n\nHelsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first World Championships in Athletics 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: football and ice hockey. Helsinki houses HJK Helsinki, Finland's largest and most successful football club, and IFK Helsingfors, their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as Stadin derby. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs IFK Helsingfors (HIFK) or Jokerit. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest bandy division,Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from Oulu: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vHn-j0t5yxIE&feature\nrelated Youtube.com] along with Botnia-69. The Olympic stadium hosted the first ever Bandy World Championship in 1957.\n\nHelsinki was elected host-city of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II they were canceled. Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the European Figure Skating Championships, and in 2017 it hosted World Figure Skating Championships.\n\nTransport\n\nRoads\n\nThe backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three semicircular beltways, Ring I, Ring II, and Ring III, which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of Länsiväylä and Itäväylä respectively. While variants of a Keskustatunneli tunnel under the city centre have been repeatedly proposed,  the plan remains on the drawing board.\n\nHelsinki has some 390 cars per 1000 inhabitants.[http://www.hel2.fi/tietoa/helbro1.pdf ]  This is less than in cities of similar population and construction density, such as Brussels' 483 per 1000, Stockholm's 401, and Oslo's 413.\n\nIntercity rail\n\nThe Helsinki Central Railway Station is the main terminus of the rail network in Finland. Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to Tampere, Oulu, Rovaniemi), and the Coastal Line to the west (to Turku). The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via Lahti to eastern parts of Finland and to Russia.\n\nA majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day as of 2017. There are international services from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg and to Moscow in Russia. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route is operated with the Allegro high-speed trains.\n\nA Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel has been proposed and agreed upon by representatives of the cities. The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the Estonian capital Tallinn, further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by Rail Baltica.\n\nAviation\n\nAir traffic is handled primarily from the international Helsinki Airport, located approximately 17 km north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of Vantaa. Helsinki's own airport, Helsinki-Malmi Airport, is mainly used for general and private aviation. Charter flights are available from Hernesaari Heliport.\n\nSea transport\n\nLike many other cities, Helsinki was deliberately founded at a location on the sea in order to take advantage of shipping. The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of icebreakers, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013. Ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, and Stockholm are serviced by various companies. Finnlines passenger-freight ferries to Gdynia, Poland; Travemünde, Germany; and Rostock, Germany are also available. St. Peter Line offers passenger ferry service to Saint Petersburg several times a week.\n\nUrban transport\n\nIn the Helsinki metropolitan area, public transportation is managed by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority, the metropolitan area transportation authority. The diverse public transport system consists of trams, commuter rail, the metro, bus lines, two ferry lines and a public bike system.\n\nHelsinki's tram system has been in operation with electric drive continuously since 1900. 13 routes that cover the inner part of the city are operated. As of 2017, the city is expanding the tram network, with several major tram line construction projects under way. These include the 550 trunk line (Raide-Jokeri), roughly along Ring I around the city center, and a new tramway to the island of Laajasalo.\n \nThe Helsinki Metro, opened in 1982, is the only metro system in Finland, albeit the Helsinki commuter rail trains operate at metro-like frequencies. In 2006, the construction of the long debated extension of the metro into Western Helsinki and Espoo was approved. The extension finally opened after delays in November 2017. An eastern extension into the planned new district of Östersundom and neighboring Sipoo has also been seriously debated. Helsinki's metro system currently consists of 25 stations, with 14 of them underground.\n\nThe commuter rail system includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the Ring Rail Line, an urban double-track railway with a station at the Helsinki Airport in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated as of 2017, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.\n\nInternational relations\n\nSpecial partnership cities\n\nHelsinki has a special partnership relation with:\n\n* Saint Petersburg, Russia\n* Tallinn, Estonia\n* Stockholm, Sweden\n* Berlin, Germany\n* Beijing, China (since 2006)\n* Moscow, Russia\n\nNotable people\n\nBorn before 1900 \n\n* Peter Forsskål (1732–1763), Swedish-Finnish naturalists and orientalist\n* Axel Hampus Dalström (1829–1882), architect\n* Jakob Sederholm (1863–1934), Petrologe\n* Karl Fazer (1866–1932), baker, confectioner, chocolatier, entrepreneur, and sport shooter\n* Emil Lindh (1867–1937), sailor\n* Oskar Merikanto (1868–1924), composer\n* Gunnar Nordström (1881–1923), theoretical physicist\n* Väinö Tanner (1881–1966), politician\n* Walter Jakobsson (1882–1957), figure skater\n* Mauritz Stiller (1883–1928), Russian-Swedish director and screenwriter\n* Karl Wiik (1883–1946), Social Democratic politician\n* Lennart Lindroos (1886–?), swimmer, Olympic games 1912\n* Erkki Karu (1887–1935), film director and producer\n* Kai Donner (1888–1935), linguist, anthropologist and politician\n* Gustaf Molander (1888–1973), Swedish director and screenwriter\n* Johan Helo (1889–1966), lawyer and politician\n* Artturi Ilmari Virtanen (1895–1973), chemist, Nobel Prize 1945\n* Elmer Diktonius (1896–1961), Finnish-Swedish writer and composer\n* Yrjö Leino (1897–1961), communist politician\n* Toivo Wiherheimo (1898–1970), economist and politician\n\nBorn after 1900 \n\n* Paavo Berglund (1929–2012), conductor\n* Laci Boldemann (1921–1969), composer\n* Irja Agnes Browallius (1901–1968), Swedish writer\n* Bo Carpelan (1926–2011), Finland-Swedish writer, literary critic and translator\n* Tarja Cronberg (born 1943), politician\n* Ragnar Granit (1900–1991), Finnish-Swedish neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate\n* Tarja Halonen (born 1943), President of Finland\n* Ville Valo (born 1976), Lead Singer of the rock band HIM\n* Reino Helismaa (1913–1965), writer, film actor and singer\n* Bengt Holmström (born 1949), Professor of Economics, Nobel laureate\n* Tove Jansson (1914–2001), Finland-Swedish writer, painter, illustrator, comic writer, graphic designer\n* Lennart Koskinen (born 1944), Swedish, Lutheran bishop\n* Olli Lehto (born 1925), mathematician\n* Samuel Lehtonen (1921–2010), bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland\n* Juha Leiviskä (born 1936), architect\n* Magnus Lindberg (born 1958), composer and pianist\n* Lill Lindfors (born 1940), Finland-Swedish singer and TV presenter\n* Vesa-Matti Loiri (born 1945), actor, comedian, singer\n* Georg Malmstén (1902–1981), singer, musician, composer, orchestra director and actor\n* Tauno Marttinen (1912–2008), composer\n* Susanna Mälkki (born 1969), conductor\n* Rolf Nevanlinna (1925–2016), architect, university teacher and writer\n* Markku Peltola (1956–2007), actor and musician\n* Einojuhani Rautavaara (1928–2016), composer\n* Elisabeth Rehn (born 1935), politician\n* Kaija Saariaho (born 1952), composer\n* Riitta Salin (born 1950), athlete\n* Esa-Pekka Salonen (born 1958), composer and conductor\n* Heikki Sarmanto (born 1939), jazz pianist and composer\n* Märta Tikkanen (born 1935), Finland-Swedish writer and philosophy teacher\n* Linus Torvalds (born 1969), software engineer, creator of Linux\n* Sirkka Turkka (born 1939), poet\n* Mika Waltari (1908–1979), writer",

    "aggregatedText" : "Helsinki (; shortened to Hki,; ;) is the capital and largest city of Finland. Helsinki is the seat of the region of Uusimaa in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of  and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located 80 km north of Tallinn, Estonia, 400 km east of Stockholm, Sweden and 390 km west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities.\n\nThe Helsinki metropolitan area includes the urban core of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen and surrounding commuter towns. It is the world's northernmost metro area of over one million people, and the city is the northernmost capital of an EU member state. Helsinki is the third largest city in the Nordic countries, after Stockholm and Oslo. Helsinki is Finland's major political, educational, financial, cultural and research center. The neighboring city of Vantaa is the location of Helsinki Airport, which has frequent service to various destinations in Europe and Asia.\n\nHelsinki was the World Design Capital for 2012, the venue for the 1952 Summer Olympics and the host of the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nHelsinki has some of the highest standards of living of a city in the world. In 2011, British magazine Monocle ranked Helsinki the world's most liveable city in its Liveable Cities Index. In the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2016 Liveability Survey, Helsinki scored ninth place among 140 cities.[https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid\nliveability2016 2016 Global Liveability Ranking]\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to a theory presented in the 1630s, settlers from Hälsingland in central Sweden had arrived to what is now known as the Vantaa River and called it Helsingå (\"Helsinge River\"), which gave rise to the names of Helsinge village and church in the 1300s. This theory is questionable, because dialect research suggests that the settlers arrived from Uppland and nearby areas. Others have proposed the name as having been derived from the Swedish word helsing, an archaic form of the word hals (neck), referring to the narrowest part of a river, the rapids. Other Scandinavian cities at similar geographic locations were given similar names at the time, e.g. Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden.\n\nWhen a town was founded in Forsby village in 1548, it was named Helsinge fors, \"Helsinge rapids\". The name refers to the Vanhankaupunginkoski rapids at the mouth of the river. The town was commonly known as Helsinge or Helsing, from which the contemporary Finnish name arose.\n\nOfficial Finnish Government documents and Finnish language newspapers have used the name Helsinki since 1819, when the Senate of Finland moved itself into the city from Turku. The decrees issued in Helsinki were dated with Helsinki as the place of issue. This is how the form Helsinki came to be used in written Finnish. As part of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire, Helsinki was known as Gelsingfors in Russian.\n\nIn Helsinki slang, the city is called Stadi (from the Swedish word stad, meaning \"city\"). Hesa (short for Helsinki), is not used by natives of the city.Ristkari, Maiju: Heinäsorsat Helsingissä. Aku Ankka #44/2013, introduction on page 2. ' is the Northern Sami name of Helsinki.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history \n\nIn the Iron Age the area occupied by present day Helsinki was inhabited by Tavastians. They used the area for fishing and hunting, for example, but due to lack of archeological finds it is difficult to say how extensive their settlements were. Pollen analysis has shown that there were cultivating settlements in the area in the 10th century and surviving historical records from the 14th century describe Tavastian settlements in the area.\n\nSwedes colonised the coastline of the Helsinki region in late 13th century after the successful Second Crusade to Finland, which lead to the defeat of the Tavastians.\n\nFounding of Helsinki \n\nHelsinki was established as a trading town by King Gustav I of Sweden in 1550 as the town of Helsingfors, which he intended to be a rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today known as Tallinn). Little came of the plans as Helsinki remained a tiny town plagued by poverty, wars, and diseases. The plague of 1710 killed the greater part of the inhabitants of Helsinki. The construction of the naval fortress Sveaborg (In Finnish Viapori, today also Suomenlinna) in the 18th century helped improve Helsinki's status, but it was not until Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 that the town began to develop into a substantial city. During the war, Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress, and about one quarter of the town was destroyed in an 1808 fire.\n\nRussian Emperor Alexander I of Russia moved the Finnish capital from Turku to Helsinki in 1812 to reduce Swedish influence in Finland, and to bring the capital closer to Saint Petersburg. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, the Royal Academy of Turku, at the time the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki, and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in neoclassical style to resemble Saint Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect C. L. Engel. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and industrialization were key factors behind the city's growth.\n\nTwentieth century\n\nDespite the tumultuous nature of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century (including the Finnish Civil War and the Winter War which both left marks on the city), Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the 1952 Olympic Games, held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the Helsinki Metro subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth.\n\nGeography\n\nCalled the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Helsinki is on the tip of a peninsula and on 315 islands. The inner city is located on a southern peninsula, Helsinginniemi (”Helsinki’s peninsula”), which is rarely referred to by its actual name, Vironniemi (”Estonia’s peninsula”). Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is very high, reaching 16494 PD/km2 in the district of Kallio, but as a whole Helsinki's population density of 3050 /km2 ranks the city as rather sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities. Much of Helsinki outside the inner city area is postwar suburbs separated by patches of forest. A narrow,  long Helsinki Central Park, stretching from the inner city to Helsinki's northern border is an important recreational area for residents. The City of Helsinki has about 11,000 boat berths and possesses over 14,000 hectares of marine fishing waters adjacent to the Capital Region. Some 60 fish species are found in this area and recreational fishing is popular.\n\nMajor islands in Helsinki include Seurasaari, Vallisaari, Lauttasaari, and Korkeasaari – the lattermost being the site of Finland’s largest zoo. Other noteworthy islands are the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg), the military island of Santahamina, and Isosaari. Pihlajasaari island is a favorite summer spot for gay men and naturists, comparable to Fire Island in New York City.\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nThe Helsinki metropolitan area, also known as the Capital Region (Finnish: Pääkaupunkiseutu, Swedish: Huvudstadsregionen) comprises four municipalities: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. The Helsinki urban area is considered to be the only metropolis in Finland. It has a population of over 1,1 million, and is the most densely populated area of Finland. The Capital Region spreads over a land area of  and has a population density of . With over 20 percent of the country's population in just 0.2 percent of its surface area, the area's housing density is high by Finnish standards.\n\nThe Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Greater Helsinki) consists of the cities of Helsinki Capital Region and ten surrounding municipalities. The Metropolitan Area covers 3697 km2 and has a population of over 1.4 million, or about a fourth of the total population of Finland. The metropolitan area has a high concentration of employment: approximately 750,000 jobs. Despite the intensity of land use, the region also has large recreational areas and green spaces. The Greater Helsinki area is the world's northernmost urban area with a population of over one million people, and the northernmost EU capital city.\n\nThe Helsinki urban area is an officially recognized urban area in Finland, defined by its population density. The area stretches throughout 11 municipalities, and is the largest such area in Finland, with a land area of  and approximately 1,2 million inhabitants.\n\nClimate\n\nHelsinki has a humid continental climate (Dfb). Owing to the mitigating influence of the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic Current (see also Extratropical cyclone), temperatures during the winter are higher than the northern location might suggest, with the average in January and February around .\n\nWinters in Helsinki are notably warmer than in the north of Finland, and the snow season is much shorter in the capital. Temperatures below  occur at most a few times a year. However, because of the latitude, days last 5 hours and 48 minutes around the winter solstice with very low Sun (at noon, the Sun is a little bit over 6 degrees in the sky), and the cloudy weather at this time of year exacerbates darkness. Conversely, Helsinki enjoys long daylight during the summer; during the summer solstice, days last 18 hours and 57 minutes.\n\nThe average maximum temperature from June to August is around 19 to. Due to the marine effect, especially during hot summer days, daily temperatures are a little cooler and night temperatures higher than further inland. The highest temperature ever recorded in the city centre was , on 18 July 1945, and the lowest was , on 10 January 1987. Helsinki Airport (in Vantaa,  north of the Helsinki city centre) recorded a temperature of , on 29 July 2010, and a low of , on 9 January 1987. Precipitation is received from frontal passages and thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are most common in the summer.\n\nCityscape\n\nCarl Ludvig Engel, appointed to plan a new city centre on his own, designed several neoclassical buildings in Helsinki. The focal point of Engel's city plan was the Senate Square. It is surrounded by the Government Palace (to the east), the main building of Helsinki University (to the west), and (to the north) the large Cathedral, which was finished in 1852, twelve years after Engel's death. Helsinki's epithet \"The White City of the North\" derives from this construction era.\n\nHelsinki is also home to numerous Art Nouveau-influenced (Jugend in Finnish) buildings belonging to the romantic nationalism trend, designed in the early 20th century and strongly influenced by Kalevala, which was a common theme of the era. Helsinki's Art Nouveau style is also featured in central residential districts, such as Katajanokka and Ullanlinna. An important architect of the Finnish Art Nouveau style was Eliel Saarinen, whose architectural masterpiece was the Helsinki Central Station.\n\nHelsinki also features several buildings by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, recognized as one of the pioneers of architectural functionalism. However, some of his works, such as the headquarters of the paper company Stora Enso and the concert venue Finlandia Hall, have been subject to divided opinions from the citizens.\n\nFunctionalist buildings in Helsinki by other architects include the Olympic Stadium, the Tennis Palace, the Rowing Stadium, the Swimming Stadium, the Velodrome, the Glass Palace, the Töölö Sports Hall, and Helsinki-Malmi Airport. The sports venues were built to serve the 1940 Helsinki Olympic Games; the games were initially cancelled due to the Second World War, but the venues fulfilled their purpose in the 1952 Olympic Games. Many of them are listed by DoCoMoMo as significant examples of modern architecture. The Olympic Stadium and Helsinki-Malmi Airport are also catalogued by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities as cultural-historical environments of national significance.\n\nHelsinki's neoclassical buildings were often used as a backdrop for scenes set to take place in the Soviet Union in many Cold War era Hollywood movies, when filming in the USSR was not possible. Some of them include The Kremlin Letter (1970), Reds (1981), and Gorky Park (1983). Because some streetscapes were reminiscent of Leningrad's and Moscow's old buildings, they too were used in movie productions. At the same time the government secretly instructed Finnish officials not to extend assistance to such film projects.Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Political Department:  \n\nIn the 21st century Helsinki has decided to allow the construction of skyscrapers. As of April 2017 there are no skyscrapers taller than 100 meters in the Helsinki area, but there are several projects under construction or planning, mainly in Pasila and Kalasatama. An international architecture competition for at least 10 high-rises to be built in Pasila is being held. Construction of the towers will start before 2020. In Kalasatama, the first 35-story (130 m) and 32-story (122 m) residential towers are already under construction. Later they will be joined by a 37-story (140 metres), two 32-story (122 metres, 400 feet), 31-story (120 metres), and 27-story (100 metres) residential buildings. In the Kalasatama area, there will be about 15 high-rises within 10 years.\n\nGovernment\n\nAs is the case in all Finnish municipalities, the city council is the main decision-making organ in local politics, dealing with issues such as city planning, schools, health care, and public transport. The council is elected every four years.\n\nThe City Council of Helsinki consists of eighty-five members. Following the most recent municipal elections in 2017, the three largest parties are the National Coalition Party (25), the Green League (21), and the Social Democrats (12).\n\nThe Mayor of Helsinki is Jan Vapaavuori.\n\nDemographics\n\nAt 53 percent, Helsinki has a higher proportion of women than the national average, 51 percent. Helsinki's current population density of 2,739.36 people per square kilometre makes Helsinki the densest city in Finland. Life expectancy for men and women is slightly below the national averages: 75.1 years for men as compared to 75.7 years, 81.7 years for women as compared to 82.5 years.\n\nHelsinki has experienced strong growth since the 1810s, when it replaced Turku as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland, which later became the sovereign Republic of Finland. The city continued to show strong growth from that time onward, with an exception during the Finnish Civil War. From the end of World War II up until the 1970s there was a massive exodus of people from the countryside to the cities of Finland, in particular Helsinki. Between 1944 and 1969 the population of the city nearly doubled from 275,000 to 525,600.\n\nIn the 1960s, the population growth of Helsinki proper began to decrease, mainly due to a lack of housing. Many residents began to move to neighbouring Espoo and Vantaa, resulting in increased population growth in both municipalities. Espoo's population increased ninefold in sixty years, from 22,874 people in 1950 to 244,353 in 2009. Vantaa saw an even more dramatic change in the same time span: from 14,976 in 1950 to 197,663 in 2009, a thirteenfold increase. These increases pushed the municipalities of Greater Helsinki into more intense cooperation in such areas as public transportation – resulting in the foundation of HSL – and waste management. The increasing scarcity of housing and the higher costs of living in the Capital Region have pushed many daily commuters to find housing in formerly rural areas, and even further, to cities such as Lohja (50 km northwest from central Helsinki), Hämeenlinna and Lahti (both 100 km from Helsinki), and Porvoo (50 km east of Helsinki).\n\nLanguage \n\nFinnish and Swedish are the official languages of the municipality of Helsinki. The majority, or 81.9% of the population, speaks Finnish as their native language. A minority, at 5.9%, speaks Swedish. Around 12.2% of the population speaks a native language other than Finnish or Swedish. Helsinki slang today combines influences mainly from Finnish and English, but has traditionally had strong Russian and Swedish influences. Finnish today is the common language of communication between Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages (New Finns) in day-to-day affairs in the public sphere between unknown persons. In instances where a speaker's knowledge of Finnish is not known, English is usually spoken. Swedish is commonly spoken in city or national agencies specifically aimed at Finland-Swedish speakers, such as the Social Services Department on Hämeentie or the Luckan Cultural centre in Kamppi. Knowledge of Finnish is also essential in business and is usually a basic requirement in the employment market.\n\nFinnish speakers surpassed Swedish speakers in 1890 to become the majority of the city's population. At the time, the population of Helsinki was 61,530.\n\nImmigration\n\nHelsinki is the global gateway to and from Finland. The city has Finland's largest immigrant population in both absolute and relative terms. There are over 140 nationalities represented in Helsinki. The largest groups () are from Sweden, Russia, Estonia, Somalia, China, Iraq, Spain, Germany, France, Vietnam, and Turkey. Helsinki was already an international city in the 19th century with a distinctive Swedish majority as well as Finnish, Russian, and German minorities.\n\nForeign citizens make up 8.0% of the population, while the total foreign-born population makes up 11.1%. In 2012, 68,375 residents spoke a native language other than Finnish, Swedish, or one of the three Sami languages spoken in Finland. The largest groups of residents not of Finnish background come from Russia (14,532), Estonia (9,065), and Somalia (6,845). Half of the immigrant population in Finland lives in Greater Helsinki, and one third in the city of Helsinki.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Helsinki Metropolitan Area generates approximately one third of Finland's GDP. GDP per capita is roughly 1.3 times the national average.\n\nThe metropolitan area's gross value added per capita is 200% of the mean of 27 European metropolitan areas, equalling those of Stockholm or Paris. The gross value added annual growth has been around 4%.\n\n83 of the 100 largest Finnish companies have their headquarters in Greater Helsinki. Two-thirds of the 200 highest-paid Finnish executives live in Greater Helsinki and 42% in Helsinki. The average income of the top 50 earners was 1.65 million euro.\n\nThe tap water is of excellent quality and it is supplied by 120 km long Päijänne Water Tunnel, one of the world's longest continuous rock tunnels. Bottled Helsinki tap water is even sold to other countries, such as Saudi Arabia.[http://www.finnfacts.com/english/main/actualities/pullovesi.htm ] \n\nReligion\n\nThe Temppeliaukio Church is a Lutheran church in the Töölö neighborhood of the city. The church was designed by architects and brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen and opened in 1969. Built directly into solid rock, it is also known as the Church of the Rock and Rock Church.\"[http://www.muuka.com/finnishpumpkin/churches/helsinki/chteh/church_chteh.html Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki]\", Retrieved 5 September 2012.\n\nEducation\n\nHelsinki has 190 comprehensive schools, 41 upper secondary schools, and 15 vocational institutes. Half of the 41 upper secondary schools are private or state-owned, the other half municipal. Higher level education is given in eight universities (see the section \"Universities\" below) and four polytechnics.\n\nUniversities\n\n*University of Helsinki\n*Aalto University\n*Hanken School of Economics\n*University of the Arts Helsinki\n*National Defence University\n\nUniversities of Applied Sciences\n\n*Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences\n*Laurea University of Applied Sciences\n*Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences\n*Arcada University of Applied Sciences\n*Diaconia University of Applied Sciences\n\nHelsinki is one of the co-location centres of the Knowledge and Innovation Community (Future information and communication society) of The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).\n\nThe educational department takes part in Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 in Finland.\n\nCulture\n\nMuseums\n\nThe biggest historical museum in Helsinki is the National Museum of Finland, which displays a vast historical collection from prehistoric times to the 21st century. The museum building itself, a national romantic style neomedieval castle, is a tourist attraction. Another major historical museum is the Helsinki City Museum, which introduces visitors to Helsinki's 500-year history. The University of Helsinki also has many significant museums, including the Helsinki University Museum \"Arppeanum\" and the Finnish Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe Finnish National Gallery consists of three museums: Ateneum Art Museum for classical Finnish art, Sinebrychoff Art Museum for classical European art, and Kiasma Art Museum for modern art, in a building by architect Steven Holl. The old Ateneum, a neo-Renaissance palace from the 19th century, is one of the city's major historical buildings. All three museum buildings are state-owned through Senate Properties.\n\nThe city of Helsinki hosts its own art collection in the Helsinki Art Museum (HAM), primarily located in its Tennispalatsi gallery. Pieces outside of Tennispalatsi include about 200 public art pieces and all art held in property owned by the city.\n\nThe Design Museum is devoted to the exhibition of both Finnish and foreign design, including industrial design, fashion, and graphic design. Other museums in Helsinki include the Military Museum of Finland, Didrichsen Art Museum, Amos Anderson Art Museum, and the Tram Museum.\n\nFile:Helsinki July 2013-26a.jpg|Classical art museum Ateneum (1887)\nHelsinki Kiasma.jpg|Kiasma museum of contemporary art (1998)\n140811Ha001.jpg|Sinebrychoff Art Museum (1842)\nFile:Helsinki Art Museum entrance 01.JPG|Helsinki Art Museum (1968)\nDesignmuseo I Helsinki.jpg|The Design Museum (1894)\nNational Museum of Finland.jpg|The National Museum of Finland (1910)\nTram museum in Helsinki-7152.jpg|Tram museum (Ratikkamuseo) (1900)\nSotakorkeakoulu.jpg|The Military Museum of Finland (1881)\nTaidehalli Helsinki.jpg|Kunsthalle Helsinki art venue (1928)\nHelsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|The Finnish Museum of Natural History (1913)\nDidrichsenin taidemuseo.jpg|Didrichsen Art Museum (1964)\nYrjönkatu 27-29.jpg|Amos Anderson Art Museum (1913)\nArppeanum - DSC05409.JPG|Helsinki University Museum \"Arppeanum\" (1869)\n\nTheatres\n\nHelsinki has three major theatres: The Finnish National Theatre, the Helsinki City Theatre, and the Swedish Theatre (Svenska Teatern). Other notable theatres in the city include the Alexander Theatre, Q-teatteri, Savoy Theatre, KOM-theatre, and Teatteri Jurkka.\n\nMusic\n\nHelsinki is home to two full-size symphony orchestras, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, both of which perform at the Helsinki Music Centre concert hall. Acclaimed contemporary composers Kaija Saariaho, Magnus Lindberg, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and Einojuhani Rautavaara, among others, were born and raised in Helsinki, and studied at the Sibelius Academy. The Finnish National Opera, the only full-time, professional opera company in Finland, is located in Helsinki. The opera singer Martti Wallén, one of the company's long-time soloists, was born and raised in Helsinki, as was mezzo-soprano Monica Groop.\n\nMany widely renowned and acclaimed bands have originated in Helsinki, including Hanoi Rocks, HIM, Stratovarius, The 69 Eyes, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Wintersun, The Rasmus, Poets of the Fall, and Apocalyptica.\n\nThe city's main musical venues are the Finnish National Opera, the Finlandia concert hall, and the Helsinki Music Centre. The Music Centre also houses a part of the Sibelius Academy. Bigger concerts and events are usually held at one of the city's two big ice hockey arenas: the Hartwall Arena or the Helsinki Ice Hall. Helsinki has Finland's largest fairgrounds, the Messukeskus Helsinki.\n\nHelsinki Arena hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, the first Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Finland, following Lordi's win in 2006.\n\nArt\n\nThe Helsinki Festival is an annual arts and culture festival, which takes place every August (including the Night of the Arts).\n\nVappu is an annual carnival for students and workers.\n\nAt the Senate Square in September / October 2010, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Finland took place: About 1.4 million people saw the international exhibition of United Buddy Bears.\n\nHelsinki is the 2012 World Design Capital, in recognition of the use of design as an effective tool for social, cultural, and economic development in the city. In choosing Helsinki, the World Design Capital selection jury highlighted Helsinki's use of 'Embedded Design', which has tied design in the city to innovation, \"creating global brands, such as Nokia, Kone, and Marimekko, popular events, like the annual Helsinki Design Week, outstanding education and research institutions, such as the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, and exemplary architects and designers such as Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto\".\n\nHelsinki also hosts many film festivals. Most of them are small venues, but some have gained renown even abroad. The most prolific would be the Love & Anarchy film festival (also known as Helsinki International Film Festival), which features films on a wide spectrum. Night Visions, on the other hand, focuses on genre cinema, screening horror, fantasy, and science fiction films in very popular movie marathons that take whole night. Another popular film festival is DocPoint, a festival that focuses solely on documentary cinema.\n\nMedia\n\nToday, there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, 67 commercial radio stations, three digital radio channels, and one nationwide and five national public service radio channels.\n\nEach year, around 12,000 book titles are published and 12 million records are sold across Finland.\n\nSanoma publishes the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (its circulation of 412,000 making it the largest), the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, the commerce-oriented Taloussanomat, and the television channel Nelonen. The other major publisher Alma Media publishes over thirty magazines, including the newspaper Aamulehti, tabloid Iltalehti, and commerce-oriented Kauppalehti. Worldwide, Finns, along with other Nordic peoples and the Japanese, spend the most time reading newspapers.\n\nYle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels in both national languages. Headquartered in the neighbourhood of Pasila, Yle is funded through a mandatory television license and fees for private broadcasters. All TV channels are broadcast digitally, both terrestrially and on cable. The commercial television channel MTV3 and commercial radio channel Radio Nova are owned by Nordic Broadcasting (Bonnier and Proventus Industrier).\n\n, around 79% of the Finnish population uses the Internet. Finland had around 1.52 million broadband Internet connections by the end of June 2007 or around 287 per 1,000 inhabitants. All Finnish schools and public libraries have Internet connections and computers, and most residents have a mobile phone. Value-added services are rare. In October 2009, Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications committed to ensuring that every person in Finland would be able to access the Internet at a minimum speed of one megabit-per-second beginning July 2010.\n\nSports\n\nHelsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first World Championships in Athletics 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: football and ice hockey. Helsinki houses HJK Helsinki, Finland's largest and most successful football club, and IFK Helsingfors, their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as Stadin derby. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs IFK Helsingfors (HIFK) or Jokerit. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest bandy division,Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from Oulu: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vHn-j0t5yxIE&feature\nrelated Youtube.com] along with Botnia-69. The Olympic stadium hosted the first ever Bandy World Championship in 1957.\n\nHelsinki was elected host-city of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II they were canceled. Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the European Figure Skating Championships, and in 2017 it hosted World Figure Skating Championships.\n\nTransport\n\nRoads\n\nThe backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three semicircular beltways, Ring I, Ring II, and Ring III, which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of Länsiväylä and Itäväylä respectively. While variants of a Keskustatunneli tunnel under the city centre have been repeatedly proposed,  the plan remains on the drawing board.\n\nHelsinki has some 390 cars per 1000 inhabitants.[http://www.hel2.fi/tietoa/helbro1.pdf ]  This is less than in cities of similar population and construction density, such as Brussels' 483 per 1000, Stockholm's 401, and Oslo's 413.\n\nIntercity rail\n\nThe Helsinki Central Railway Station is the main terminus of the rail network in Finland. Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to Tampere, Oulu, Rovaniemi), and the Coastal Line to the west (to Turku). The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via Lahti to eastern parts of Finland and to Russia.\n\nA majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day as of 2017. There are international services from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg and to Moscow in Russia. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route is operated with the Allegro high-speed trains.\n\nA Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel has been proposed and agreed upon by representatives of the cities. The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the Estonian capital Tallinn, further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by Rail Baltica.\n\nAviation\n\nAir traffic is handled primarily from the international Helsinki Airport, located approximately 17 km north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of Vantaa. Helsinki's own airport, Helsinki-Malmi Airport, is mainly used for general and private aviation. Charter flights are available from Hernesaari Heliport.\n\nSea transport\n\nLike many other cities, Helsinki was deliberately founded at a location on the sea in order to take advantage of shipping. The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of icebreakers, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013. Ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, and Stockholm are serviced by various companies. Finnlines passenger-freight ferries to Gdynia, Poland; Travemünde, Germany; and Rostock, Germany are also available. St. Peter Line offers passenger ferry service to Saint Petersburg several times a week.\n\nUrban transport\n\nIn the Helsinki metropolitan area, public transportation is managed by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority, the metropolitan area transportation authority. The diverse public transport system consists of trams, commuter rail, the metro, bus lines, two ferry lines and a public bike system.\n\nHelsinki's tram system has been in operation with electric drive continuously since 1900. 13 routes that cover the inner part of the city are operated. As of 2017, the city is expanding the tram network, with several major tram line construction projects under way. These include the 550 trunk line (Raide-Jokeri), roughly along Ring I around the city center, and a new tramway to the island of Laajasalo.\n \nThe Helsinki Metro, opened in 1982, is the only metro system in Finland, albeit the Helsinki commuter rail trains operate at metro-like frequencies. In 2006, the construction of the long debated extension of the metro into Western Helsinki and Espoo was approved. The extension finally opened after delays in November 2017. An eastern extension into the planned new district of Östersundom and neighboring Sipoo has also been seriously debated. Helsinki's metro system currently consists of 25 stations, with 14 of them underground.\n\nThe commuter rail system includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the Ring Rail Line, an urban double-track railway with a station at the Helsinki Airport in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated as of 2017, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.\n\nInternational relations\n\nSpecial partnership cities\n\nHelsinki has a special partnership relation with:\n\n* Saint Petersburg, Russia\n* Tallinn, Estonia\n* Stockholm, Sweden\n* Berlin, Germany\n* Beijing, China (since 2006)\n* Moscow, Russia\n\nNotable people\n\nBorn before 1900 \n\n* Peter Forsskål (1732–1763), Swedish-Finnish naturalists and orientalist\n* Axel Hampus Dalström (1829–1882), architect\n* Jakob Sederholm (1863–1934), Petrologe\n* Karl Fazer (1866–1932), baker, confectioner, chocolatier, entrepreneur, and sport shooter\n* Emil Lindh (1867–1937), sailor\n* Oskar Merikanto (1868–1924), composer\n* Gunnar Nordström (1881–1923), theoretical physicist\n* Väinö Tanner (1881–1966), politician\n* Walter Jakobsson (1882–1957), figure skater\n* Mauritz Stiller (1883–1928), Russian-Swedish director and screenwriter\n* Karl Wiik (1883–1946), Social Democratic politician\n* Lennart Lindroos (1886–?), swimmer, Olympic games 1912\n* Erkki Karu (1887–1935), film director and producer\n* Kai Donner (1888–1935), linguist, anthropologist and politician\n* Gustaf Molander (1888–1973), Swedish director and screenwriter\n* Johan Helo (1889–1966), lawyer and politician\n* Artturi Ilmari Virtanen (1895–1973), chemist, Nobel Prize 1945\n* Elmer Diktonius (1896–1961), Finnish-Swedish writer and composer\n* Yrjö Leino (1897–1961), communist politician\n* Toivo Wiherheimo (1898–1970), economist and politician\n\nBorn after 1900 \n\n* Paavo Berglund (1929–2012), conductor\n* Laci Boldemann (1921–1969), composer\n* Irja Agnes Browallius (1901–1968), Swedish writer\n* Bo Carpelan (1926–2011), Finland-Swedish writer, literary critic and translator\n* Tarja Cronberg (born 1943), politician\n* Ragnar Granit (1900–1991), Finnish-Swedish neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate\n* Tarja Halonen (born 1943), President of Finland\n* Ville Valo (born 1976), Lead Singer of the rock band HIM\n* Reino Helismaa (1913–1965), writer, film actor and singer\n* Bengt Holmström (born 1949), Professor of Economics, Nobel laureate\n* Tove Jansson (1914–2001), Finland-Swedish writer, painter, illustrator, comic writer, graphic designer\n* Lennart Koskinen (born 1944), Swedish, Lutheran bishop\n* Olli Lehto (born 1925), mathematician\n* Samuel Lehtonen (1921–2010), bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland\n* Juha Leiviskä (born 1936), architect\n* Magnus Lindberg (born 1958), composer and pianist\n* Lill Lindfors (born 1940), Finland-Swedish singer and TV presenter\n* Vesa-Matti Loiri (born 1945), actor, comedian, singer\n* Georg Malmstén (1902–1981), singer, musician, composer, orchestra director and actor\n* Tauno Marttinen (1912–2008), composer\n* Susanna Mälkki (born 1969), conductor\n* Rolf Nevanlinna (1925–2016), architect, university teacher and writer\n* Markku Peltola (1956–2007), actor and musician\n* Einojuhani Rautavaara (1928–2016), composer\n* Elisabeth Rehn (born 1935), politician\n* Kaija Saariaho (born 1952), composer\n* Riitta Salin (born 1950), athlete\n* Esa-Pekka Salonen (born 1958), composer and conductor\n* Heikki Sarmanto (born 1939), jazz pianist and composer\n* Märta Tikkanen (born 1935), Finland-Swedish writer and philosophy teacher\n* Linus Torvalds (born 1969), software engineer, creator of Linux\n* Sirkka Turkka (born 1939), poet\n* Mika Waltari (1908–1979), writer.
