  "textBody" : "Morocco spans from the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean on the north and the west respectively, into large mountainous areas in the interior body, to the Sahara desert in the far south. Morocco is a Northern African country, located in the extreme north west of Africa on the doors of continental Europe. The strait of Gibraltar separates Spain off Morocco with a 13 km span of water. Morocco borders the North Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the west Mediterranean Sea to the north.\n\nThe terrain of Morocco is largely mountainous. The Atlas Mountains stretch from the central north to the south west. It expands to about 1350 km and is the dorsal spine of the country. To the north of the Atlas Mountains, there are the Rif Mountains, a chain that makes part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Andalusia, Spain. The massive range expands to about 250 km from Tangier in the west to Nador eastward.\n\nIn the west of the country, along the Atlantic coast, the Moroccan Plateau stretches from Tangier to Agadir, about 800 km long, and get inward to Saiss Plains near Fes and Tansift-Alhaouz near Marrakech. These vast plains promotes fertile agricultural lands and support 15% of the local economy.\n\nIn the extreme South-East of the country, the lands are arid, due to their proximity to the Sahara desert of Algeria. Palm trees oasis are developed in many regions, notably in Figuig and Zagora.\n\nGeography statistics\n\nCoordinates:\n\nMap references:\nAfrica\n\nArea:\ntotal:\n446,550 km² (excluding Western Sahara), 710,850 km² (Morocco and Western Sahara combined)\nland:\n446,300 km² (or 710,600 km²)\nwater:\n250 km²\n\nArea – comparative:\nMorocco without Western Sahara is slightly larger than California; slightly larger than Newfoundland and Labrador; slightly more than half the size of New South Wales province of Australia; slightly less than twice the size of the United Kingdom\n\nMorocco and Western Sahara combined are slightly larger than Texas\n\nLand boundaries:\ntotal:\n2,017.9 km\nborder countries:\nAlgeria 1 559 km, Free Zone (de facto border along the Moroccan Western Sahara Wall) 2200 km, Spain (Ceuta) 6.3 km, Spain (Melilla) 9.6 km\n\nCoastline:\n1835 km\n\n2945 km (including the coast of Western Sahara)\n\nMaritime claims:\nTerritorial sea:\n12 nmi\nContiguous zone:\n24 nmi\nExclusive economic zone:\n200 nmi\nContinental shelf:\n200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nMorocco's climate can be divided into two parts: The northwest and the southeast. \nIn the southeast, the climate is arid, and poorly populated. In the northwest the climate is temperate and akin to the climatic conditions that prevail in the Iberian Peninsula. 95% of Moroccan population lives in these regions.\n\nThe largely populated areas of the northwest of the country is predominantly Mediterranean, but since the country is heavily mountainous, continental and alpine influence is evident, as well as the oceanic influence along the Atlantic coastline. And finally, the semi-arid lands, that cover few regions in the northeast, the central south and the southwest.\n\nAlong the Mediterranean coast, the climate is typically Mediterranean and supports all types of typical Mediterranean vegetation. The summers are moderately hot and the winters are mild. Further away from the coast, into the Rif Mountain range, the climate starts to become more continental in character, with colder winters and hotter summers. At elevations above 1000 m, the climate is alpine with warm summers and cold winters. Rainfall is much higher on the west side, than it is on the east side. The average annual precipitation is between 600 and, and 300 and respectively. Snow is abundant at higher elevations.\n\n# Typical Mediterranean climate cities: Tangier, Tétouan, Al Hoceima, Nador\n# Typical continental-influenced cities: Chefchaouen, Issaguen, Targuist, Taza\n# Typical alpine-influenced cities: Bab Berred\n\nAlong the Atlantic coast, the climate is Mediterranean with an oceanic influence. The imprint of the oceanic climate differs along the coastline from region to region. It is generally presented from Asilah to Essaouira. The summers are warm to moderately hot, and winters are cooler than in the Mediterranean coast. Further away from the coastal lands, into the Atlas Mountain range, the climate starts to become more continental in character, with colder winters and hotter summers. At elevations above 1000 m, the climate is typically alpine, with warm summers and cold winters. Rainfall is generally high. The average annual precipitations is between 500 and on the north, but as you move southward, the average drops by about 100 to. Snow is abundant at higher elevations. There are two ski stations, one in the middle-Atlas Mischliffen, and the other in the High-Atlas Oukaïmeden.\n\n# Typical oceanic-influenced cities: Rabat, Casablanca, Essaouira, Larache\n# Typical continental-influenced cities: Fès, Meknès, Khenifra, Beni Mellal\n# Typical alpine-influenced cities: Ifrane, Azrou, Midelt, Imouzzer Kandar\n\nThe southern regions of the northwest are Semi-arid influenced. Rainfall is lower, and is between 250 and annually. Although temperature ranges generally do not change in comparison with the upper provinces, a slight increase in high averages is not to be dismissed.
