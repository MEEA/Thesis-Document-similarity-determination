  "textBody" : "Loch is the Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Scots word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn.\n\nIn English English and Hiberno-English, the anglicised spelling lough ( or) is commonly found in place names; in Lowland Scots and Scottish English, the spelling \"loch\" is always used.\n\nSome lochs could also be called firths, fjords, estuaries, straits or bays. Sea-inlet lochs are often called sea lochs or sea loughs. Many loughs are connected to stories of lake-bursts, signifying their mythical origin.\n\nBackground\n\nThis name for a body of water is Insular CelticThe current form has currency in the following languages: Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Manx, and has been borrowed into Lowland Scots, Scottish English, Irish English and Standard English. in origin and is applied to most lakes in\nScotland and to many sea inlets in the west and north of Scotland. The word is Indo-European in origin; cf. Latin lacus.\n\nLowland Scots orthography, like Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Irish, represents with ch, so the word was borrowed with identical spelling.\n\nEnglish borrowed the word separately from a number of loughs in the previous Cumbric language areas of Northumbria and Cumbria. Earlier forms of English included the sound as gh (compare Scots bricht with English bright). However, by the time Scotland and England joined under a single parliament, English had lost the sound. This form was therefore used when the English settled Ireland. The Scots convention of using ch remained, hence the modern Scottish English loch.\n\nLikewise, in the Insular Celtic languages, the representation of, is lu in Old Welsh and llw in Middle Welsh such as in today's Welsh placenames Llanllwchaiarn, Llwchwr, Llyn Cwm Llwch, Amlwch, Maesllwch.

However, reference to the latter as loughs (lower case initial), rather than as lakes, inlets and so on, is unusual.\n\nAlthough there is no strict size definition, a small loch is often known as a lochan (so spelled also in Scottish Gaelic; in Irish it is spelled lochán).\n\nPerhaps the most famous Scottish loch is Loch Ness, although there are other large examples such as Loch Awe, Loch Lomond and Loch Tay.\n\nExamples of sea lochs in Scotland include Loch Long, Loch Fyne, Loch Linnhe, and Loch Eriboll.\n\nUses of lochs\n\nSome new reservoirs for hydroelectric schemes have been given names faithful to the names for natural bodies of water – for example, the Loch Sloy scheme, and Lochs Laggan and Treig (which form part of the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme near Fort William). Other expanses are simply called reservoirs, e.g. Blackwater Reservoir above Kinlochleven.\n\nScottish lakes\n\nScotland has very few bodies of water called lakes. The Lake of Menteith, an Anglicisation of the Scots Laich o Menteith meaning a \"low-lying bit of land in Menteith\", is applied to the loch there because of the similarity of the sounds of the words laich and lake.
