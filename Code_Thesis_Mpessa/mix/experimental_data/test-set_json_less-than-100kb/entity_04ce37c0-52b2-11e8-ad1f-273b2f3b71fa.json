He has also appeared as a guest on several talk, variety and religious shows. \n\nMacLeod's long career began in films in 1957, playing opposite Peter Mann in The Sword of Ali Baba (1965), Anthony Franciosa in A Man Called Gannon (1968), Christopher George in The Thousand Plane Raid, and Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas along with Carroll O'Connor in Kelly's Heroes (1970). He then achieved continuing television success co-starring opposite Ernest Borgnine on McHale's Navy (1962–1964), as Joseph \"Happy\" Haines, and on The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977) as Murray Slaughter. He is best known for his starring role on The Love Boat (1977–1986), in which MacLeod played Captain Merrill Stubing.\n\nEarly life\n\nGavin MacLeod was born as Allan George See on February 28, 1931, in Mount Kisco, New York, the elder of two children. His mother, Margaret (née Shea) See (1906–2004), a middle school dropout, worked for Reader's Digest. His father, George See (1906–1945), an electrician, was part Chippewa (Ojibwa). He grew up in Pleasantville and studied acting at Ithaca College, graduating in 1952. After serving in the United States Air Force, he moved to New York City and worked at Radio City Music Hall while looking for acting work. At about this time he changed his name, drawing \"Gavin\" from a physically disabled victim in a TV drama, and \"MacLeod\" from his Ithaca drama coach, Beatrice MacLeod.MacLeod, Gavin (2013). This is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith & Life. Nashville, Tenn.: W Publishing Group. p. 32.  MacLeod said in a 2013 interview with Parade Magazine about his stage name, he \"felt as if my name was getting in the way of my success.\" Allan, he wrote, \"just wasn’t strong enough,\" and See was \"too confusing.\"\n\nCareer\n\nMacLeod made his television debut in 1957 on The Walter Winchell File at the age of 26. His first movie appearance was a small, uncredited role in The True Story of Lynn Stuart in 1958.

In December 1961, he landed a guest role on The Dick Van Dyke Show as Mel's cousin Maxwell Cooley, a wholesale jeweler. This was his first time working with Mary Tyler Moore.
