By one estimate,\"Wilhelm Gustloff: World's Deadliest Sea Disasters\". Unsolved History, The Discovery Channel. Season 1, Episode 14. (Original air date: 26 March 2003) 9,400 people died, which makes it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history.\n\nConstructed as a cruise ship for the Nazi Kraft durch Freude (Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1937, she had been requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine (German navy) in 1939. She served as a hospital ship in 1939 and 1940. She was then assigned as a floating barracks for naval personnel in Gdynia (Gotenhafen) before being put into service to transport evacuees in 1945.\n\nConstruction\n\nWilhelm Gustloff was constructed by the Blohm & Voss shipyards. Measuring  long by  wide with a capacity of , she was launched on 5 May 1937.\n\nThe ship was originally intended to be named Adolf Hitler but was named after Wilhelm Gustloff, a leader of the National Socialist Party's Swiss branch, who had been assassinated by a Jewish medical student in 1936. Hitler decided on the name change after sitting next to Gustloff’s widow during his memorial service.\n\nCruise liner\n\nWilhelm Gustloff was the first purpose-built cruise liner for the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) and used by subsidiary organisation Kraft durch Freude (KdF) (Strength Through Joy). Her purposes were to provide recreational and cultural activities for German functionaries and workers, including concerts, cruises, and other holiday trips, and as a public relations tool, to present \"a more acceptable image of the Third Reich.\"Williams, David, Wartime Disasters at Sea, Patrick Stephens Limited, Nr Yeovil, UK, 1997, p. 227. She was the flagship of the KdF cruise fleet, her last civilian role, until the spring of 1939.\n\nMilitary career\n\nDuring the summer of 1939, the vessel was returned to service to bring the Condor Legion back from Spain after the victory of the Nationalist forces under General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War.\n From September 1939 to November 1940, she served as a hospital ship, with her official designation being Lazarettschiff D.\n\nBeginning on 20 November 1940, the medical equipment was removed from the ship and she was repainted from the hospital ship colours of white with a green stripe to standard naval grey.[http://www.wilhelmgustloff.com/history_navyship.htm CONVERSION TO FLOATING U-BOAT BARRACKS] As a consequence of the British blockade of the German coastline, she was used as an accommodations ship (barracks) for approximately 1,000 U-boat trainees of the 2nd Submarine Training Division (2.

Heinz Schön, a German archivist and Gustloff survivor who carried out extensive research into the sinking during the 1980s and 1990s, concluded that Wilhelm Gustloff was carrying a crew of 173 (naval armed forces auxiliaries), 918 officers, NCOs, and men of the 2 Unterseeboot-Lehrdivision, 373 female naval auxiliary helpers, 162 wounded soldiers, and 8,956 civilians, of which an estimated 5,000 were children, for a total of 10,582 passengers and crew. The passengers besides civilians included Gestapo personnel, members of the Organisation Todt and Nazi officials with their families.Cathryn J.

The ship was overcrowded, and due to the temperature and humidity inside many passengers defied orders not to remove their life jackets.[http://www.wilhelmgustloff.com/sinking.htm M.S. Wilhelm Gustloff – SINKING]\n\nThe ship left Danzig at 12:30 pm on 30 January 1945, accompanied by the passenger liner Hansa, also filled with civilians and military personnel, and two torpedo boats. Hansa and one torpedo boat developed mechanical problems and could not continue, leaving Wilhelm Gustloff with one torpedo boat escort, Löwe.[http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/captured/torpedoboats/lowe/index.html Löwe Torpedoboot 1940–1959 Sleipner Class] The ship had four captains (Wilhelm Gustloff's captain, two merchant marine captains and the captain of the U-Boat complement housed on the vessel) on board, and they could not agree on the best course of action to guard against submarine attacks. Against the advice of the military commander, Lieutenant Commander Wilhelm Zahn (a submariner who argued for a course in shallow waters close to shore and without lights), Wilhelm Gustloff's captain—Friedrich Petersen—decided to head for deep water which was known to have been cleared of mines. When he was informed by a mysterious radio message of an oncoming German minesweeper convoy, he decided to activate his ship's red and green navigation lights so as to avoid a collision in the dark, making Wilhelm Gustloff easy to spot in the night.\n\nAs Wilhelm Gustloff had been fitted with anti-aircraft guns, and the Germans, in obedience to the rules of war, did not mark her as a hospital ship, no notification of her operating in a hospital capacity had been given and, as she was transporting military personnel, she did not have any protection as a hospital ship under international accords.[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague10.htm The Avalon Project – Laws of War: Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention (Hague X); 18 October 1907] \n\nSinking\n\nThe ship was soon sighted by the , under the command of Captain Alexander Marinesko. The submarine sensor on board the escorting torpedo boat had frozen, rendering it inoperable, as had Wilhelm Gustloffs anti-aircraft guns, leaving the vessels defenseless. Marinesko followed the ships to their starboard (seaward) side for two hours before making a daring move to surface his submarine and steer it around Wilhelm Gustloffs stern to attack it from the port side closer to shore, where the attack would be less expected.  At around 9 pm (CET), Marinesko ordered his crew to launch four torpedoes at Wilhelm Gustloffs port side about 30 km offshore between Großendorf and Leba. The first was nicknamed \"for the Motherland,\" the second \"for Leningrad,\" the third \"for the Soviet people\" and the fourth torpedo which got jammed in the torpedo tubes and had to be dismantled was called \"for Stalin.\"  The three torpedoes which were fired successfully all struck Wilhelm Gustloff on her port side.\n\nThe first torpedo which struck Wilhelm Gustloffs bow caused the watertight doors to seal off the bow which contained the crews' quarters where off-duty crew members were sleeping. The second torpedo hit the accommodations for the women’s naval auxiliary located in the ship's drained swimming pool, dislodging the pool tiles at high speed, which caused heavy casualties; only three of the 373 quartered there survived. The third torpedo was a direct hit on the engine room located amidships, disabling all power and communications. Reportedly, only nine lifeboats were able to be lowered; the rest had frozen in their davits and had to be broken free. About 20 minutes after the impact of the torpedoes, Wilhelm Gustloff listed dramatically to port so that the lifeboats lowered on the high Starboard side crashed into the ship's tilting side, destroying many lifeboats and spilling their occupants across the ship's side. The water temperature in the Baltic Sea at that time of year is usually around 4 °C; however, this was a particularly cold night, with an air temperature of  and ice floes covering the surface. Many deaths were caused either directly by the torpedoes or by drowning in the onrushing water. Others were crushed in the initial stampede caused by panicked passengers on the stairs and decks.  Many others jumped into the icy Baltic. The majority of those who perished succumbed to exposure in the freezing water.Roger Moorhouse (19 June 2013): [http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2013/06/death-baltic Death in the Baltic] History Today, retrieved 19 June 2013\n\nLess than 40 minutes after being struck, Wilhelm Gustloff was lying on her side and sank bow-first ten minutes later, in 44 m of water.\n\nGerman forces were able to rescue some (a total of 996) of the survivors from the attack: torpedo boat T-36 rescued 564 people; torpedo boat Löwe, 472; minesweeper M387, 98; minesweeper M375, 43; minesweeper M341, 37; the steamer Göttingen saved 28; torpedo-recovery boat (torpedofangboot) TF19, seven; the freighter Gotenland, two; and patrol boat (Vorpostenboot) V1703 was able to save one baby.\n\nAll four captains on Wilhelm Gustloff survived her sinking, but an official naval inquiry was started only against Wilhelm Zahn. His degree of responsibility was never resolved, however, because of Nazi Germany's collapse in 1945.[http://www.wilhelmgustloff.com/facts_keyplayers_ind.htm M.S. Wilhelm Gustloff – FACTS – Glossary | Individuals]\n\nLosses\n\nThe figures from the research of Heinz Schön make the total loss in the sinking to be 9,343 total, including about 5,000 children.Pipes, Jason. In [http://www.feldgrau.com/wilhelmgustloff.html A Memorial to the Wilhelm Gustloff] Pipes cites Heinz Schön  as reporting in Die Gustloff Katastrophe that the loss of life was 9,343, almost 5000 of whom were children.\n\nHeinz Schön's more recent research is backed up by estimates made by a different method. An episode of Unsolved History that aired in March 2003  on the Discovery Channel program  undertook a computer analysis of her sinking.

This analysis considered the passenger density based on witness reports and a simulation of escape routes and survivability with the timeline of the sinking.Michael Leja, References (a source in German)\n\nAftermath\n\nMany ships carrying civilians were sunk during the war by both the Allies and Axis.George Martin [http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/maritime-1.html Maritime Disasters of World War II] However, based on the latest estimates of passenger numbers and those known to be saved, Wilhelm Gustloff remains the largest loss of life resulting from the sinking of one vessel in maritime history. Günter Grass, in an interview published by The New York Times in April 2003, \"One of the many reasons I wrote Crabwalk was to take the subject away from the extreme Right ...They said the tragedy of Wilhelm Gustloff was a war crime. It wasn't. It was terrible, but it was a result of war, a terrible result of war.\"Riding, Alan. Still Intrigued by History's Shadows; Günter Grass Worries About the Effects of War.

The women on board the ship at the time of the sinking were inaccurately described by Soviet propaganda as \"SS personnel from the German concentration camps\".[http://www.grani.ru/opinion/sokolov/m.134310.html Потопленный миф] There were, however, 373 female naval auxiliaries amongst the passengers.\n\nOn the night of 9–10 February, just 11 days after the sinking, S-13 sank another German ship, , killing about 4,500 people.\n\nBefore sinking Wilhelm Gustloff, Alexander Marinesko was facing a court martial due to his problems with alcohol and for being caught in a brothel while he and his crew were off duty, so Marinesko was thus deemed \"not suitable to be a hero\" for his actions and instead of gaining the title \"Hero of the Soviet Union,\" he was awarded the lesser Combat Order of the Red Banner. Although widely recognized as a brilliant commander, he was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the navy in October 1945. In 1960 he was reinstated as captain third class and granted a full pension. In 1963 Marinesko was given the traditional ceremony due to a captain upon his successful return from a mission. He died three weeks later from cancer. Marinesko was posthumously named a Hero of the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990.[https://translate.google.ca/translate?hlen&sl\nru&tlen&u\nhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.warheroes.ru%2Fhero%2Fhero.asp%3FHero_id%3D1012 Translation of Marinesko page from www.warheroes.ru]\n\nWreckage\n\nNoted as \"Obstacle No. 73\" on Polish navigation charts,Irwin J.

The majority of those who perished succumbed to exposure in the freezing water.Roger Moorhouse (19 June 2013): [http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2013/06/death-baltic Death in the Baltic] History Today, retrieved 19 June 2013\n\nLess than 40 minutes after being struck, Wilhelm Gustloff was lying on her side and sank bow-first ten minutes later, in 44 m of water.\n\nGerman forces were able to rescue some (a total of 996) of the survivors from the attack: torpedo boat T-36 rescued 564 people; torpedo boat Löwe, 472; minesweeper M387, 98; minesweeper M375, 43; minesweeper M341, 37; the steamer Göttingen saved 28; torpedo-recovery boat (torpedofangboot) TF19, seven; the freighter Gotenland, two; and patrol boat (Vorpostenboot) V1703 was able to save one baby.\n\nAll four captains on Wilhelm Gustloff survived her sinking, but an official naval inquiry was started only against Wilhelm Zahn. His degree of responsibility was never resolved, however, because of Nazi Germany's collapse in 1945.[http://www.wilhelmgustloff.com/facts_keyplayers_ind.htm M.S. Wilhelm Gustloff – FACTS – Glossary | Individuals]\n\nLosses\n\nThe figures from the research of Heinz Schön make the total loss in the sinking to be 9,343 total, including about 5,000 children.Pipes, Jason. In [http://www.feldgrau.com/wilhelmgustloff.html A Memorial to the Wilhelm Gustloff] Pipes cites Heinz Schön  as reporting in Die Gustloff Katastrophe that the loss of life was 9,343, almost 5000 of whom were children.\n\nHeinz Schön's more recent research is backed up by estimates made by a different method.

Günter Grass, in an interview published by The New York Times in April 2003, \"One of the many reasons I wrote Crabwalk was to take the subject away from the extreme Right ...They said the tragedy of Wilhelm Gustloff was a war crime. It wasn't. It was terrible, but it was a result of war, a terrible result of war.\"Riding, Alan. Still Intrigued by History's Shadows; Günter Grass Worries About the Effects of War.

The women on board the ship at the time of the sinking were inaccurately described by Soviet propaganda as \"SS personnel from the German concentration camps\".[http://www.grani.ru/opinion/sokolov/m.134310.html Потопленный миф] There were, however, 373 female naval auxiliaries amongst the passengers.\n\nOn the night of 9–10 February, just 11 days after the sinking, S-13 sank another German ship, , killing about 4,500 people.\n\nBefore sinking Wilhelm Gustloff, Alexander Marinesko was facing a court martial due to his problems with alcohol and for being caught in a brothel while he and his crew were off duty, so Marinesko was thus deemed \"not suitable to be a hero\" for his actions and instead of gaining the title \"Hero of the Soviet Union,\" he was awarded the lesser Combat Order of the Red Banner. Although widely recognized as a brilliant commander, he was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the navy in October 1945. In 1960 he was reinstated as captain third class and granted a full pension. In 1963 Marinesko was given the traditional ceremony due to a captain upon his successful return from a mission. He died three weeks later from cancer. Marinesko was posthumously named a Hero of the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990.[https://translate.google.ca/translate?hlen&sl\nru&tlen&u\nhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.warheroes.ru%2Fhero%2Fhero.asp%3FHero_id%3D1012 Translation of Marinesko page from www.warheroes.ru]\n\nWreckage\n\nNoted as \"Obstacle No. 73\" on Polish navigation charts,Irwin J.
