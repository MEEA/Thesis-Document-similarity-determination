  "textBody" : "In number theory, the Legendre symbol is a multiplicative function with values 1, −1, 0 that is a quadratic character modulo an odd prime number p: its value on a (nonzero) quadratic residue mod p is 1 and on a non-quadratic residue (non-residue) is −1. Its value on zero is 0.\n\nThe Legendre symbol was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1798 in the course of his attempts at proving the law of quadratic reciprocity. Generalizations of the symbol include the Jacobi symbol and Dirichlet characters of higher order. The notational convenience of the Legendre symbol inspired introduction of several other \"symbols\" used in algebraic number theory, such as the Hilbert symbol and the Artin symbol.\n\nDefinition \n\nLet p be an odd prime number. An integer a is a quadratic residue modulo p if it is congruent to a perfect square modulo p and is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p otherwise. The Legendre symbol is a function of a and p defined as\n\n\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \n\\begin{cases}\n 1 & \\text{ if } a \\text{ is a quadratic residue modulo } p \\text{ and } a \\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}, \\\\\n-1 & \\text{ if } a \\text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo } p, \\\\\n 0 & \\text{ if } a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}.  \n\\end{cases}\n\nLegendre's original definition was by means of the explicit formula\n\n \\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\equiv a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p} \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}. \n\nBy Euler's criterion, which had been discovered earlier and was known to Legendre, these two definitions are equivalent.Hardy & Wright, Thm. 83. Thus Legendre's contribution lay in introducing a convenient notation that recorded quadratic residuosity of a mod p. For the sake of comparison, Gauss used the notation aRp, aNp according to whether a is a residue or a non-residue modulo p. It turns out that Legendre's definition can be generalized even further by using the domain of definition \\mathbb{F}_q^*. This definition fits succinctly as a short exact sequence of abelian groups\n\n0 \\to (\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^2 \\to \\mathbb{F}_q \\to \\{ \\pm 1 \\} \\to 0\n\nFor typographical convenience, the Legendre symbol is sometimes written as (a|p) or (a/p). The sequence (a|p) for a equal to 0, 1, 2,... is periodic with period p and is sometimes called the Legendre sequence, with {0,1,−1} values occasionally replaced by {1,0,1} or {0,1,0}. In the following table, the variables a and p have been renamed k and n, respectively; and each row n can be seen to exhibit periodicity just described.\n\nTable of values\n\nThe following is a table of values of Legendre symbol () with n ≤ 127, k ≤ 30, n odd prime.\n\nProperties of the Legendre symbol \n\nThere are a number of useful properties of the Legendre symbol which, together with the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to compute it efficiently.\n\n* The Legendre symbol is periodic in its first (or top) argument: if a ≡ b (mod p), then \n*: \\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{p}\\right).\n* The Legendre symbol is a completely multiplicative function of its top argument:\n*:\\left(\\frac{ab}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{p}\\right). \n* In particular, the product of two numbers that are both quadratic residues or quadratic non-residues modulo p is a residue, whereas the product of a residue with a non-residue is a non-residue. A special case is the Legendre symbol of a square:\n*:\\left(\\frac{x^2}{p}\\right) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\mbox{if }p\\nmid x\\\\ 0 & \\mbox{if }p\\mid x. \\end{cases}\n* When viewed as a function of a, the Legendre symbol () is the unique quadratic (or order 2) Dirichlet character modulo p.\n* The first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:\n*:\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)  (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \n\n  \\begin{cases}\n     1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 1\\pmod{4} \\\\\n    -1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 3\\pmod{4}.  \n  \\end{cases}\n* The second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:\n*: \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) (-1)^\\tfrac{p^2-1}{8} \n\n  \\begin{cases}\n     1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 1\\mbox{ or }7 \\pmod{8} \\\\\n    -1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 3\\mbox{ or }5 \\pmod{8}.\n  \\end{cases}\n* Special formulas for the Legendre symbol () for small values of a:\n** For an odd prime p ≠ 3,  \n**: \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) (-1)^{\\big\\lfloor \\frac{p+1}{6}\\big\\rfloor} \n\n  \\begin{cases}\n     1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 1\\mbox{ or }11 \\pmod{12} \\\\\n    -1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 5\\mbox{ or }7 \\pmod{12}.\n  \\end{cases}\n** For an odd prime p ≠ 5,  \n**: \\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) (-1)^{\\big\\lfloor \\frac{2p+2}{5}\\big \\rfloor} \n\n  \\begin{cases}\n     1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 1\\mbox{ or }4 \\pmod5 \\\\\n    -1 & \\mbox{ if }p \\equiv 2\\mbox{ or }3 \\pmod5.\n  \\end{cases}\n* The Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, … are defined by the recurrence   If p is a prime number then\n*: F_{p-\\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right)} \\equiv 0 \\pmod p, \\qquad F_{p} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) \\pmod p.  \nFor example, \n:\\begin{align}\n    \\left(\\tfrac{2}{5}\\right)  &-1, &    F_3 &\n 2,  &    F_2 &= 1,  \\\\ \n    \\left(\\tfrac{3}{5}\\right)  &-1, &    F_4 &\n 3,  &    F_3 &= 2,  \\\\ \n    \\left(\\tfrac{5}{5}\\right)  & 0, &    F_5 &\n 5,  &        &      \\\\ \n    \\left(\\tfrac{7}{5}\\right)  &-1, &    F_8 &\n 21, &    F_7 &= 13, \\\\ \n    \\left(\\tfrac{11}{5}\\right) & 1, & F_{10} &\n 55, & F_{11} &= 89.\n  \\end{align} \n*This result comes from the theory of Lucas sequences, which are used in primality testing.Ribenboim, p. 64; Lemmermeyer, ex. 2.25–2.28, pp. 73–74.
