  "textBody" : "Hawick ( ; , ) is a town in the Scottish Borders council area and historic county of Roxburghshire in the east Southern Uplands of Scotland. It is  south-west of Jedburgh and  south-southeast of Selkirk. It is one of the farthest towns from the sea in Scotland, in the heart of Teviotdale, and the biggest town in the former county of Roxburghshire. Hawick's architecture is distinctive in that it has many sandstone buildings with slate roofs. The town is at the\nconfluence of the Slitrig Water with the River Teviot.  Hawick is known for its yearly Common Riding, for its rugby team Hawick Rugby Football Club and for its knitwear industry.\n\nAt the 2001 census Hawick had a resident population of 14,801.  By 2011, this had reduced to 14,294.\n\nMonuments \n\nThe west end of the town contains \"the Mote\", the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey. In the centre of the High Street is the Scots baronial style town hall, built in 1886, and the east end has an equestrian statue, known as \"the Horse\", erected in 1914. Drumlanrig's Tower, now a museum, dates largely from the mid-16th century.\nIn 2009 another monument the \"Turning of the Bull\" (artist, Angela Hunter, Innerleithen, Scotland) was unveiled in Hawick. This monument depicts William Rule turning the wild bull as it was charging King Robert the Bruce, thus saving the king's life and beginning the Scottish Clan of Turnbull. A poem written by John Leyden commemorates this historical event. \"His arms robust the hardy hunter flung around his bending horns, and upward wrung, with writhing force his neck retorted round, and rolled the panting monster to the ground, crushed, with enormous strength, his bony skull; and courtiers hailed the man who turned the bull.\"\n\nEconomy \n\nCompanies such as Hawick Cashmere, Hawick Knitwear, Johnstons of Elgin, Lyle & Scott, Peter Scott, Pringle of Scotland, and Scott and Charters,  all have had and in many cases still have manufacturing plants in Hawick, producing some of the most luxurious cashmere and merino wool knitwear in the world today. The first knitting machine was brought to Hawick in 1771 by  John Hardie, building on an existing carpet manufacturing trade.  Originally based on linen, this quickly moved to wool and factories multiplied, driving the growth of the town. Engineering firm Turnbull and Scott previously had their headquarters in an Elizabethan-style listed building on Commercial Road before moving to Burnfoot.\n\nTransport \n\nHawick lies in the centre of the valley of the Teviot. The A7 Edinburgh to Carlisle road passes through the town, with main roads also leading to Berwick-upon-Tweed (the A698) and Newcastle upon Tyne (the A6088, which joins the A68 at the Carter Bar, 16 mi south-east of Hawick).\n\nThe town lost its rail service in 1969, when as part of the Beeching Axe the 'Waverley Line' from Carlisle to Edinburgh via Hawick was closed. It was said to be the farthest large town from a railway station in the United Kingdom, but this changed as a result of the partial reopening of the Waverley Line to Tweedbank, near Galashiels. Regular buses serve the railway station at Carlisle, 42 mi away.\n\nThe nearest major airports are at Edinburgh, 57 mi away, and Newcastle, 56 mi away.\n\nCulture and traditions \n\nThe town hosts the annual Common Riding, which combines the annual riding of the boundaries of the town's common land with the commemoration of a victory of local youths over an English raiding party in 1514. In March 2007, this was described by the Rough Guide publication World Party as one of the best parties in the world.\n\nPeople from Hawick call themselves \"Teries\", after a traditional song which includes the line \"Teribus ye teri odin\".\n\nTeri Talk \n\nMany Hawick residents speak the local dialect of Border Scots which is informally known as \"Teri Talk\". It is similar (but not identical by any means) to the dialects spoken in surrounding towns, especially Jedburgh, Langholm and Selkirk. The speech of this general area was described in Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland (1873) by James Murray,  considered the first systematic study of any dialect. The Hawick tongue retains many elements of Old English, together with particular vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.  Its distinctiveness arose from the relative isolation of the town.\n\nSports \n\nThe town is the home of Hawick Rugby Football Club and a senior football team, Hawick Royal Albert, who currently play in the East of Scotland Football League.\n\nRivalry between the small Border towns is generally played out on the rugby union field.  The historical competition continues to this day, as Hawick's main rival is the similarly-sized town of Galashiels.\n\nThe Hawick Baw game was once played here by the 'uppies' and the 'doonies' on the first Monday after the new moon in the month of February.
