  "textBody" : "Helsingør, classically known in English as Elsinore, is a city in eastern Denmark.\n\nHelsingør Municipality had a population of 61,519 on 1 January 2015.\n\nIt is known for its castle Kronborg, which William Shakespeare most presumably had in mind for his famous play Hamlet,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/denmark/articles/Shakespeares-Danish-links/ but Shakespeare mentions Elsinore only once in his play.\n\nThe HH Ferry route connects Helsingør with Helsingborg in Sweden.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name Helsingør is derived from the word hals meaning \"neck\" or \"narrow strait\", referring to the narrowest point of the \nØresund (Øre Sound) between what is now Helsingør and Helsingborg, Sweden. \nThe people were mentioned as Helsinger (which may mean \"the people of the strait\") for the first time in King Valdemar the Victorious's Liber Census Daniæ from 1231 (not to be confused with the Helsings of Hälsingland in Sweden).early records of Helsingør and Flynderborg (\"possibly already mentioned by Saxo\"): J. D. Qvist, Annaler for nordisk oldkyndighed, Kongelige Nordiske oldskriftselskab, 1836, [https://books.google.ch/books?idInEJAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA306 p. 306] \nPlacenames show that the Helsinger may have had their main fort at Helsingborg and a fortified landing place at Helsingør, to control the ferry route across the strait.\n\nHelsingør as it is known today was founded in the 1420s by the Danish king Eric of Pomerania. He established the Sound Dues in 1429, meaning all foreign ships passing through the strait had to pay a toll, which constituted up to two-thirds of Denmark's state income. With this income Eric of Pomerania built the castle Krogen. The castle was expanded in the 1580s and renamed Kronborg.  All ships had to stop in Helsingør to get their cargo taxed and pay a toll to the Danish Crown, but it also generated a significant trade for the town. In 1672 Helsingør had grown into the third biggest town in Denmark.  \nJohan Isaksson Pontanus  (Rerum Danicarum Historica, 1631) attributes a long and partially fictitious history to Helsingør.\n\nThe Sound Dues were abolished in 1857 with the Copenhagen Convention, where all naval nations agreed to pay a one-time fee.\n\nThe oldest known fortified building of Helsingør is Flynderborg, an early medieval fortress situated on a hill just south of the medieval city.\nAround 1200, the first church, Saint Olaf's Church, was built. \nA number of convents once surrounded the church, but now all that remains is the church building, today the cathedral of the Diocese of Helsingør. The oldest parts of the cathedral of Helsingør date back to the 13th century and tell us that the fishermen's village, as Helsingør was then, had grown to a  town of importance.\n\nTransport\n\nThe car ferry line between Helsingør and Helsingborg, Scania, Sweden is the busiest in the world with more than 70 departures in each direction every day. The route is known as the HH Ferry route and has been sailed by several shipping lines through history. The car ferry terminal is connected to the town's main railway station. From the station, trains depart to Copenhagen every 20 minutes. Trains also depart to Hillerød and Gilleleje. There are another 6 stations or train stops within the city and connected suburbs. Apart from Helsingør Station and Ferry Terminal also Snekkersten station, Espergærde station, Mordrup station and the train stops at the line to Gilleleje,  Grønnehave, Marienlyst and Højstrup. Google maps\nThe E47 Motorway towards Copenhagen begins just outside the city limits. The town and surrounding areas also has a network of local and regional buses.\n\nIndustrialisation\n\nFor a century, the Helsingør Værft or Elsinore shipyard was a prominent landmark, which covered the whole area between the town and Kronborg Castle. It was founded in 1882. At its height in 1957, it had 3,600 employees. The last ship left the shipyard in 1983 and it closed the same year following heavy losses.\n\nThe Wiibroe brewery, founded in 1840, was the second brewery in Denmark to ship bottled beer, just three years after Carlsberg. The last beer was brewed at Wiibroe in Helsingør in 1998. Carlsberg continues to brew beer under the Wiibroe Årgangsøl label.\n\nPost-industrialisation\n\nAfter the end of the industrial era, the town of Helsingør had to redefine itself, and came up with an ambitious project: Kulturhavn Kronborg, literally \"Culture-harbour of Kronborg\". It officially opened on 26 May 2013, intended to appeal to tourists with an interest in culture. The main attraction of Kulturhavn Kronborg is Kronborg Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Besides the historical attractions of the site, William Shakespeare's play Hamlet is performed annually in its courtyard since 1937. There is a longstanding tradition of performing the play in English, and notable actors in the title role have included Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Christopher Plummer, Derek Jacobi, and in 2009 Jude Law. At the heart of Kulturhavn Kronborg lies kulturværftet or The Culture Yard, a new cultural centre and a public library located in the old dockyard. It opened in 2010. The former dry dock now houses the Danish Maritime Museum.\n\nIn the centre of the harbour basin stands the polished steel sculpture Han (He) by artist duo Elmgreen and Dragset, commissioned by the City of Helsingør in 2012. It was inaugurated by then Minister of culture, Uffe Elbæk, in June 2012. It is seen as the counterpart (and even little brother) to Edvard Eriksen's world-famous The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, and has caused both praise and protests among locals.\n\nThe Swedish city of Helsingborg lies a short distance across the Øresund from Helsingør, approximately 4 km. European route E55 joins the two cities; ferries connect the two sides.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe new Danish Maritime Museum was designed by Danish prize-winning architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG).\n\nJørn Utzon lived in Helsingør in his youth because his father was an engineer at Helsingør Værft. Utzon designed The Kingo Houses (1956–60) and The Hammershøj Care Centre (1962) in the city. The project was completed by Birger Schmidt (1966) after Utzon moved to Sydney to work on the Sydney Opera House.\n\nNotable natives\n\nup to 1750\n\n* Christiern Pedersen (c.1480–1554) Danish canon, humanist scholar, writer, printer and publisher.\n* Pieter Isaacsz (1569–1625), Danish-born Dutch Golden Age painter.\n* Johan Isaaksz Pontanus (1571–1639) Dutch historiographer.\n* Niels Claussøn Senning (c.1580–1617) Danish/Norwegian clergyman, Bishop of the Diocese of Oslo from 1608/1617\n* Bernhard Keil (1624–1687) Danish Baroque painter who became a pupil of Rembrandt.\n* Jørgen Iversen Dyppel (1638–1683), the first governor of the Danish West Indies 1672/1680. \n* Stephen Hansen (1701–1770) Danish industrialist, businessman and General War Commissioner.\n* Jean Abraham Grill (1736–1792), Swedish merchant, director of the Swedish East India Company.\n* Hans Christian Amberg (1749–1815) Danish lexicographer.\n\n1750 to 1900\n\n* Hartvig Marcus Frisch (1754–1816) was director of the Royal Greenland Trading Department 1781/1816. \n* Christian Frederik Hansen (1788–1873), Danish military officer who served as Minister of Defence.\n* Christian Julius de Meza (1792–1865) was the commander of the Danish Army during the 1864 Second Schleswig War. \n* Johan Frederik Møller, (1797-1871) Danish painter and photographer.\n* Robert Cleaver Chapman (1803–1902), known as the \"apostle of Love\", was a pastor, teacher and evangelist.\n* Sir Edward Knox (1819–1901) Danish-born Australian politician, sugar refiner and banker.\n* Heinrich August Georg Schiøtt (1823–1895) Danish portrait painter.\n* Knud Frederik Vilhelm Hannibal Melbye (1824–1882) Danish marine artist.  \n* Ludvig Lorenz (1829–1891), Danish physicist and mathematician, named the Lorenz gauge condition.\n* Fairfax Frederik Fenwick (1852–1920) New Zealand cricketer \n* Olivia Nielsen (1852-1910), Trade union activist \n* Gordon Norrie (1855–1941) Danish surgeon and ophthalmologist of Scottish parentage, named Norrie disease.\n*Wilhelm Johannsen (1857–1927) Danish botanist, plant physiologist, and geneticist, coined the terms phenotype and genotype.\n* Peter Elfelt (1866 – 1931) Photographer and Cinema pioneer, first Danish film.\n* Alfred Lind (1879–1959) Danish cinematographer, screenwriter and film director of the silent era.\n* August Emanuel Sørensen (1896–1979) Danish track and field athlete, competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\nsince 1900\n\n* Flemming Vögg (1914–1991) Danish fencer, competed in the team foil event at the 1948 Summer Olympics\n* Simon Ove Christian Oglivie Spies (1921–1984) Danish tycoon.\n* Ove Verner Hansen (1932–2016) Danish opera singer and actor.\n* Jørn Steffensen (born 1944) Danish modern pentathlete, competed at the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympic Games\n* Steen Rasmussen (born 1955), artificial life scientist, coined the term \"complex systems dogma\".\n* Morten Rudå (born 1960) Norwegian actor.\n* Tue Hellstem (born 1961) Danish modern pentathlete, competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n* Morten Løkkegaard (born 1964) Danish politician and Member of the European Parliament.\n* Jan Grarup (born 1968) Danish photojournalist, specialises in war and conflict photography.\n* Mette Jæger Blomsterberg (born 1970) Danish pastry chef, restaurateur and cookbook writer.\n* Helle Fagralid (born 1976) Danish actress of Faroese descent. \n* Mads Vibe-Hastrup (born 1978) Danish professional golfer.\n* Susanne Grinder (born 1981) Danish ballet dancer, joined the Royal Danish Ballet in 1998, becoming a principal dancer in 2012.\n* Mikkel Hansen (born 1987), handball player who won the IHF World Player of the Year 2011.\n\nDistricts\n\nCentrum\n* North: Grønnehave (Green Gardens), Højstrup and Marienlyst, Hellebæk, Højstrup, Ålsgårde and Hornbæk\n* West: Sundparken, Grøningen, Nøjsomheden and Vapnagård Gurre, Tikøb\n* South: Skotterup and Snekkersten and Espergærde\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns — sister cities\n\nHelsingør is twinned with:\n* Gdańsk, Poland, since 1992\n* Sanremo, Italy\n* Helsingborg, Sweden\n* Harstad, Norway\n* Lake Elsinore, California, United States\n* Pärnu, Estonia\n\nIn fiction and popular culture\n\n* William Shakespeare's play Hamlet (whence the English spelling \"Elsinore\" derives) takes place mostly at Kronborg Castle in Helsingør.\n* In the 1983 comedy Strange Brew, which is loosely based on Hamlet, the protagonists are given jobs at Elsinore Brewery.\n* In Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, Helsingør fires mortar shells at the heroes in book seven, The Surgeon's Mate, as they sail past on their way to a rendezvous in the Baltic.\n*In the second chapter of Philip Roth's novel Our Gang (1971), Trick E.
