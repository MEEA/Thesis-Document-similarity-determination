  "textBody" : "Costa Rica does not officially have a military. However, it does have small paramilitary forces which perform policing and border patrol functions.\n\nHistory \n\nOn December 1, 1948, President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica abolished the military of Costa Rica after victory in the civil war in that year. (Spanish)\nIn a ceremony in the Cuartel Bellavista, Figueres broke a wall with a mallet symbolizing an end to Costa Rica's military spirit.\n\nIn 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican Constitution. The budget previously dedicated to the military now is dedicated to security, education and culture. Costa Rica maintains Police Guard forces.\n\nThe museum Museo Nacional de Costa Rica was placed in the Cuartel Bellavista as a symbol of commitment to culture. In 1986, President Oscar Arias Sánchez declared December 1 as the Día de la Abolición del Ejército (Military abolition day) with Law #8115. Unlike its neighbors, Costa Rica has not endured a civil war since 1948. Costa Rica maintains small forces capable of law enforcement, but has no permanent standing army.\n\nPublic Force of the Ministry of Public Security (1996)\n\nIn 1996, the Ministry of Public Security established the Fuerza Pública or Public Force, a gendarmarie which reorganized and eliminated the Civil Guard, Rural Assistance Guard, and Frontier Guards as separate entities. They are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, border patrol, and tourism security functions.\n\nOutside the Fuerza Pública, there is a small Special Forces Unit, the Unidad Especial de Intervencion (UEI) or Special Intervention Unit, an elite commando force which trains with special forces from around the world, but is not part of the main police forces.  Instead it is part of the Intelligence and Security Directorate (DIS) which reports directly to the Minister of the Presidency. About 70 members strong, it is organized along military lines, although officially a civilian police unit.\n\nIts motto is \"God, Fatherland, and Honor.\" Commissioner of Police Juan José Andrade Morales serves as its current Commissioner General.\n\nAircraft inventory in 2016\n\nThere are 15 aircraft operated by Air Vigilance Service as government support, law enforcement, and civil duties.",
