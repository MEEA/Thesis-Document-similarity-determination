  "textBody" : "Food writing is writing that focuses on the topic of food, both widely and narrowly defined, and includes work by food critics and food historians.\n\nDefinition\n\nFood writers regard food as a substance and as a cultural phenomenon. John T. Edge, an American food writer, explains how writers in the genre view its topic: \"Food is essential to life. It’s arguably our nation’s biggest industry. Food, not sex, is our most frequently indulged pleasure. Food—too much, not enough, the wrong kind, the wrong frequency—is one of our society’s greatest causes of disease and death.\"Edge, John T. [http://www.creativenonfiction.org/thejournal/articles/issue41/edge.html \"Between the Lines: Picnic in the Democrative Forest,\" Creative Nonfiction; Issue 41, 2011.] Retrieved on April 25, 2012.  Another American food writer, Mark Kurlansky, links this vision of food directly to food writing, giving the genre's scope and range when he observes: “Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about man’s relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. It is about memory and tradition and, at times, even about sex.”Kurlansky, Mark. Choice Cuts: a Savory Selection of Food Writing from around the World and throughout History.  New York: Penguin, 2002, p. 1.  \n\nBecause food writing is topic centered, it is not a genre in itself, but writing that uses a wide range of traditional genres, including recipes, journalism, memoir, and travelogues. Food writing can refer to poetry and fiction, such as Marcel Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time), with its famous passage in which the narrator recollects his childhood memories as a result of sipping tea and eating a madeleine; or Robert Burns' poem \"Address to a Haggis\", 1787. Charles Dickens is notable as a novelist who wrote memorably about food, e.g., in his A Christmas Carol (1843).\n\nOften, however, food writing is used to specify writing that takes a more literary approach to food, such as that of the famous American food writer M. F. K. Fisher, who describes her writing about food as follows:\n\nIt seems to me our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it ... and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied ... and it is all one.Fisher, M. F. K. The Gastronomical Me. New York: North Point, 1989, p. ix.\n\nIn this literary sense, food writing aspires toward more than merely communicating information about food; it also aims to provide readers with an aesthetic experience. Yet another American food writer, Adam Gopnik, divides such food writing into two categories, \"the mock epic and the mystical microcosmic,\" and provides examples of their most noted practitioners: \n\nThe mock epic (A. J. Liebling, Calvin Trillin, the French writer Robert Courtine, and any good restaurant critic) is essentially comic and treats the small ambitions of the greedy eater as though they were big and noble, spoofing the idea of the heroic while raising the minor subject to at least temporary greatness. The mystical microcosmic, of which Elizabeth David and M. F. K. Fisher are the masters, is essentially poetic, and turns every remembered recipe into a meditation on hunger and the transience of its fulfillment.Gopnik, Adam.

Contemporary food writers working in this mode include Ruth Reichl, Betty MacDonald, and Jim Harrison.\n\nAs a term, \"food writing\" is a relatively new descriptor.
