  "textBody" : "The great man theory is a 19th-century idea according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or heroes; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence, wisdom, or political skill used their power in a way that had a decisive historical impact. The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, but in 1860 Herbert Spencer formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.Robert L. Carneiro \"[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_2/5_2_2.pdf Herbert Spencer as an Anthropologist]\" Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 5, 1981, pp. 171–72Robert Rives La Monte Socialism: Positive and Negative, Chicago: Charles H.

[http://www.bartleby.com/59/17/greatmantheo.html The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Third Edition)], Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 2002. In his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions of \"heroes\", giving detailed analysis of the influence of several such men (including Muhammad, Shakespeare, Luther, Rousseau, Pericles, Napoleon, and Wagner). Carlyle also felt that the study of great men was \"profitable\" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's true nature.Carlyle, Thomas.

An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur.  The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories.  For example, all information on the post-Roman \"Migrations Period\" of European History is compiled under the biography of Attila the Hun.  This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as Leon Bloy, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,  Spengler and Max Weber,As to Hegel and Nietzsche: Edelstein, Alan (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?idenzisDOv4jUC&pg\nPA33&dq%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history&hl\nen&saX&ved\n0ahUKEwji7dji45TYAhUuSt8KHS7KArwQ6AEILDAB#vonepage&q\n%22Great%20Man%20Theory%22%20heroic%20history&ffalse Everybody is Sitting on the Curb: How and why America's Heroes Disappeared] Greenwood.
