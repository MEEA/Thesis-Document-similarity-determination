  "textBody" : "The Juan Fernández Islands () are a sparsely inhabited island group reliant on tourism and fishing in the South Pacific Ocean. Situated 670 km off the coast of Chile, they are composed of three main volcanic islands: Robinson Crusoe, Alejandro Selkirk and Santa Clara. They are considered part of Insular Chile.\n\nThe islands are primarily known for having been the home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk for more than four years from 1704, which may have inspired Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Most of the archipelago's present-day inhabitants reside on Robinson Crusoe Island, mainly in the capital, San Juan Bautista, at Cumberland Bay on the island's north coast.The islands' area and population data retrieved from the 2012 census.\n\nThe group of islands are part of Chile's Valparaíso Region (which also includes Easter Island) and, along with the Desventuradas Islands, form one of the nine communes of Valparaíso Province. The islands are named after Juan Fernandez, an explorer in the 1570s who discovered them.\n\nGeography\n\n* Robinson Crusoe Island (), also known as Isla Más a Tierra, is located closest to the mainland of continental South America, and is surrounded by a number of islets, including Juanango, Viñilla, Los Chamelos, Los Claveles and El Verdugo.\n** Santa Clara (), lying 1 km southwest of Robinson Crusoe.\n* Alejandro Selkirk Island (), also known as Isla Más Afuera, is located 180 km further west.\n\nAlejandro Selkirk is the largest of the Juan Fernández Islands at , and its highest peak, De Los Innocentes, is 1329 m. The island's population was 57 in 2012. Robinson Crusoe is the second largest island in the archipelago at ; its highest peak, El Yunque, is 915 m. The population of Robinson Crusoe was 843 in 2012. Santa Clara is  in area and reaches a height of 375 m. Santa Clara is uninhabited. The maximum elevations of Juan Fernández, 915 m for Robinson Crusoe and 1329 m for Alejandro Selkirk, respectively, are high enough to cause the phenomenon known as a Kármán vortex street, which can be seen from space.\n\nThe islands are volcanic in origin, produced by the movement of the Nazca Plate over the Juan Fernández hotspot. As the plate moved eastward over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions formed the Juan Fernández Ridge before being subducted under the South American continent at the Peru–Chile Trench. The islands occur where the peaks of the submarine ridge have protruded above sea level. Radiometric dating indicates that Santa Clara is the oldest of the islands, at 5.8 million years old, followed by Robinson Crusoe, 3.8 – 4.2 million years old, and Alexander Selkirk, 1.0 – 2.4 million years old.\n\nClimate\n\nThe islands have a subtropical Mediterranean climate,[http://www.conaf.cl/parques/ficha-parque_nacional_archipielago_de_juan_fernandez-35.html \"Parque Nacional Archipiélago de Juan Fernández\"] . Corporacion Nacional Forestal de Chile (2010). Retrieved 27 May 2010. moderated by the cold Humboldt Current, which flows northward to the east of the islands, and the southeast trade winds. Temperatures range from 3 C to 34 C, with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler, with occasional frosts on Robinson Crusoe.\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 1081 mm, varying from 318 mm to 1698 mm year to year. Much of the variability in rainfall depends on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above 500 m experience almost daily rainfall, while the western, leeward side of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara are quite dry.\n\nBiota and ecology\n\nThe Juan Fernández islands are home to a high percentage of rare and endemic plants and animals, and are recognized as a distinct ecoregion. The volcanic origin and remote location of the islands meant that the islands' flora and fauna had to reach the archipelago from far across the sea; as a result, the island is home to relatively few plant species and very few animal species. The closest relatives of the archipelago's plants and animals are found in the Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregions of southern South America, including the Valdivian temperate rain forests, Magellanic subpolar forests, and Desventuradas Islands.\n\nFlora\n\nThere are 209 native species of vascular plants in the Juan Fernandez Islands, approximately 150 of which are flowering plants, and 50 are ferns. There are 126 species (62 percent) that are endemic, with 12 endemic genera and one endemic family, Lactoridaceae. Many plants are characteristic of the Antarctic flora, and are related to plants found in southern South America, New Zealand and Australia. Vegetation zones generally correspond to elevation, with grasslands and shrublands at lower elevations, tall and montane forests at middle elevations, and shrublands at the highest elevations. The two main islands have somewhat distinct plant communities.\n\nAlejandro Selkirk is mostly covered with grassland from 0 to 400 m, interspersed with wooded ravines (quebradas), home to dry forests of Myrceugenia and Zanthoxylum fagara. From 400 m to 600 m are lower montane forests, with upper montane forest from 600 m to 950 m. The treeline is at approximately 950 m, above which is alpine shrubland and grassland, dominated by temperate Magellanic vegetation such as Acaena, Dicksonia, Drimys, Empetrum, Gunnera, Myrteola, Pernettya, and Ugni. On Robinson Crusoe, grasslands predominate from 0 to 100 m; introduced shrubs from 100 m to 300 m; tall forests from 300 m to 500 m; montane forests from 500 m to 700 m, with dense tree cover of Cuminia fernandezia, Fagara, and Rhaphithamnus venustus; tree fern forests from 700 m to 750 m, and brushwood forests above 750 m. Santa Clara is covered with grassland.\n\nThree endemic species dominate the tall and lower montane forests of the archipelago, Drimys confertifolia on both main islands, Myrceugenia fernandeziana on Robinson Crusoe, and M. schulzei on Alexander Selkirk. Endemic tree fern species of southern hemisphere genus Dicksonia (D. berteriana on Robinson Crusoe and D. externa on Alexander Selkirk) and the endemic genus Thyrsopteris (T. elegans) are the predominant species in the tree-fern forests. An endemic species of sandalwood, Santalum fernandezianum, was overexploited for its fragrant wood, has not been seen since 1908, and is believed extinct. The Chonta palm (Juania australis) is endangered.\n\nFile:Rob-cru.png|Map of Robinson Crusoe Island (including Santa Clara Island)\nFile:Isla mas Afuera Juan Fernandez (Chili).jpg|Map of Alejandro Selkirk Island\nFile:Juan fernandez 1927.jpg|Map of both islands\nFile:Robinson Crusoe.JPG|Satellite images of Juan Fernández Islands (Alejandro Selkirk Island, inset left)\nFile:CL Pacific islands.PNG|overview map\n\nFauna\n\nThe Juan Fernández Islands have a very limited fauna, with no native land mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. Seventeen land and sea-bird species breed on the islands. The island has three endemic bird species, and two endemic subspecies. Introduced fauna by humans include rats and goats. Robinson Crusoe Island is home to an endemic and endangered hummingbird, the Juan Fernández firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis). This large hummingbird, about 11 cm long, is thought to number only about 500 individuals. The other endemic bird species are the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant (Anairetes fernandezianus) of Robinson Crusoe Island, and the Masafuera rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae) of Alejandro Selkirk Island.[http://tropicalconservationscience.mongabay.com/content/v7/TCS-2014-Vol7(4)_677-689_Gonzalez.pdf Gonzalez J.

The endemic Juan-Fernandez spiny lobster (without claws) lives in the marine waters (Jasus frontalis). The Juan Fernández fur seal (Arctocephalus philippii) also lives on the islands. This species was nearly exterminated in the sixteenth to nineteenth century, but it was rediscovered in 1965. A census in 1970 found about 750 fur seals living there. Only two were sighted on the Desventuradas Islands, located some 780 km to the north. The actual population of the Desventuradas may be higher, because the species tends to hide in sea caves. There seems to be a yearly population increase of 16–17 percent.\n\nHistory\n\nThe archipelago was discovered on 22 November 1574, by the Spanish sailor Juan Fernández, who was sailing south between Callao and Valparaíso along a route which he also discovered, hundreds of miles west of the coast of Chile, which avoided the northerly Humboldt current. He called the islands Más Afuera, Más a Tierra, and Santa Clara.Brand, Donald D. (1967). The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations. New York: The American Geographical Society. p. 127.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the islands were used as a hideout for pirates, were the site of Alexander Selkirk's four-year marooning, and provided a location for a penal colony. In the 1740s, they were visited by Commodore Anson's flotilla during his ill-fated venture to the South Seas. The location of the archipelago was fixed by Alessandro Malaspina in 1790; previous charts had differed on the location.\n\nDuring the maritime fur trade era of the early 19th century the islands were a source of fur seal skins, and the Juan Fernández fur seal was nearly driven to extinction. In his book, Two Years Before the Mast (Chapter VII), Richard Henry Dana, Jr. described the islands as he found them circa 1834. At this time the main island was being used as a penal colony. However, when Dr John Coulter visited the penal colony in the early 1840s, he reported it deserted after the convicts had risen up and killed the soldiers who had held them captive. The prisoners fled to mainland Chile, where they were later hunted down and shot. The story appears in Coulter's book Adventures in the Pacific (1845). In 1908, the islands were visited by the Swedish Magellanic Expedition and Carl Skottsberg is believed to have been the last to have seen the Santalum fernandezianum tree alive.\n\nLate in 1914 the islands were the rendezvous for Admiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asiatic Squadron as he gathered his ships together before defeating the British under Admiral Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. Following the Royal Navy's win at the Battle of the Falkland Islands a month later, the only surviving German cruiser, , was hunted down and cornered at Más a Tierra early in 1915, where it was scuttled after a brief battle with British cruisers.[http://www.comunajuanfernandez.cl/dresden.htm \"El Crucero Alemán Dresden\"]. Commune Juan Fernández (2010). Retrieved 8 August 2010.\n\nIn 1966 the Chilean government renamed Más Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island and Más a Tierra as Robinson Crusoe Island, in order to promote tourism. Incidentally, Selkirk never set foot on Más Afuera, only on Más a Tierra. On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave the Juan Fernández Islands and Easter Island the status of \"special territories\" of Chile. Pending the enactment of a charter the archipelago will continue to be governed as a commune of the Valparaíso Region.[http://www.bcn.cl/leyes/pdf/original/263040.pdf \"Chilean Law 20,193\"].
