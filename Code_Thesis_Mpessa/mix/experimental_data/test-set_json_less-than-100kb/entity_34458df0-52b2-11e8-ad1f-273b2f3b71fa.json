Named after Joseph Lister, a pioneer of antiseptic surgery, Listerine was developed in 1879 by Joseph Lawrence, a chemist in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nOriginally marketed by the Lambert Pharmacal Company (which later became Warner-Lambert), Listerine has been manufactured and distributed by Johnson & Johnson since that company's acquisition of Pfizer's consumer healthcare division in late December 2006.\n\nThe Listerine brand name is also used in toothpaste, Listerine Whitening rinse, Listerine Fluoride rinse (Listerine Tooth Defense), Listerine SmartRinse (children's fluoride rinse), PocketPaks, and PocketMist. In September 2007, Listerine began selling its own brand of self-dissolving teeth-whitening strips.\n\nHistory \n\nInspired by Louis Pasteur's ideas on microbial infection, the English doctor Joseph Lister demonstrated in 1865 that use of carbolic acid on surgical dressings would significantly reduce rates of post-surgical infection. Lister's work in turn inspired St. Louis-based doctor Joseph Lawrence to develop an alcohol-based formula for a surgical antiseptic which included eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol (Its exact composition is a commercial secret). Lawrence named his antiseptic \"Listerine\" in honor of Lister.\n\nLawrence hoped to promote Listerine's use as a general germicide as well as a surgical antiseptic, and licensed his formula to a local pharmacist named Jordan Wheat Lambert in 1881. Lambert subsequently started the Lambert Pharmacal Company, marketing Listerine. Listerine was promoted to dentists for oral care in 1895 and  was the first over-the-counter mouthwash sold in the United States, in 1914.  It became widely known and entered common household use after Jordan Wheat Lambert's son Gerard Lambert joined the company and promoted an aggressive marketing campaign.\n\nAccording to Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner's book Freakonomics:Note that previous editions of Freakonomics incorrectly described halitosis as a \"faux medical term\", which this Wikipedia article previously reflected.\n\nIn 1955, Lambert Pharmacal merged with New York-based Warner-Hudnut and became Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company and incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in Morris Plains, New Jersey.[http://www.goantiques.com/detail,warner-hudnut-early,345642.html Warner-Hudnut, Inc.

In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that Listerine had \"no efficacy\" at either preventing or alleviating the symptoms of sore throats and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and to include in the next $10.2 million worth of Listerine ads specific mention that \"Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.\" The advertisement run by Listerine added the preamble \"contrary to prior advertising\".Business Its Legal, Ethical, and Global Environment by Marianne M.

In 1995, FreshBurst was added, then in 2003 Natural Citrus. In 2006 a new addition to the \"less intense\" variety, Vanilla Mint, was released. Nine different kinds of Listerine are on the market in the U.S. and elsewhere: Original, Cool Mint, FreshBurst, Natural Citrus, Naturals, Soft Mint (Vanilla Mint), UltraClean (formerly Advanced Listerine), Tooth Defense (mint shield), and Whitening pre-brush rinse (clean mint).\n\nComposition\n\nThe active ingredients listed on Listerine bottles are essential oils which are menthol (mint) 0.042%, thymol (thyme) 0.064%, methyl salicylate (wintergreen) 0.06%, and eucalyptol (eucalyptus) 0.092%.[http://whatsinproducts.com/types/type_detail/1/9569/standard/Listerine%20Antiseptic%20Mouthwash,%20Original-05/22/2008/10-001-115 Materials Safety Data Sheet for Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Original-05/22/2008] In combination all have an antiseptic effect and there is some thought that methyl salicylate may have an anti inflammatory effect as well.Mason, L.; Moore, RA; Edwards, JE; McQuay, HJ; Derry, S; Wiffen, PJ (2004). \"Systematic review of efficacy of topical rubefacients containing salicylates for the treatment of acute and chronic pain\".
