  "textBody" : "In mathematics, an inverse function (or anti-function) is a function that \"reverses\" another function: if the function  applied to an input  gives a result of , then applying its inverse function  to  gives the result , and vice versa. I.e.,  if and only if .\n\nAs a simple example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by . Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number , multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get  back from some output value, say , we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to  and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,\ng(y) = \\frac{y + 7}{5}.\nWith  we have that  and .\n\nNot all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function  to have an inverse, it must have the property that for every  in  there must be one, and only one  in  so that . This property ensures that a function  will exist having the necessary relationship with .\n\nDefinitions\n\nLet  be a function whose domain is the set , and whose image (range) is the set . Then  is invertible if there exists a function  with domain  and image , with the property:\nf(x) y\\,\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,\\,g(y) \n x.\n\nIf  is invertible, the function  is unique, which means that there is exactly one function  satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function  is then called the inverse of , and is usually denoted as .\n\nStated otherwise, a function is invertible if and only if its inverse relation is a function on the range , in which case the inverse relation is the inverse function.\n\nNot all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element  must correspond to no more than one ; a function  with this property is called one-to-one or an injection. If  is to be a function on , then each element  must correspond to some . Functions with this property are called surjections. This property is satisfied by definition if  is the image (range) of , but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called bijections. The inverse of an injection  that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a partial function on , which means that for some ,  is undefined. If a function  is invertible, then both it and its inverse function  are bijections.\n\nThere is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the \"set-theoretic\" or \"graph\" definition using ordered pairs in which a codomain is never referred to. Under this convention all functions are surjections, and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection. The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.\n\nExample: Squaring and square root functions\n\nThe function  given by  is not injective since each possible result y (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in  â€“ one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-injective or, in some applications, information-losing.\n\nIf the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be  with the same rule as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible. The inverse function here is called the (positive) square root function.\n\nInverses and composition\n\nIf  is an invertible function with domain  and range , then\n\n f^{-1}\\left( \\, f(x) \\, \\right) = x, for every x \\in X. \n\nUsing the composition of functions we can rewrite this statement as follows:\n\n f^{-1} \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X, \n\nwhere  is the identity function on the set ; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In category theory, this statement is used as the definition of an inverse morphism.\n\nConsidering function composition helps to understand the notation . Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called iteration. If  is applied  times, starting with the value , then this is written as ; so , etc. Since , composing  and  yields , \"undoing\" the effect of one application of .\n\nNote on notation\n\nWhile the notation  might be misunderstood,  certainly denotes the multiplicative inverse of  and has nothing to do with the inverse function of .\n\nIn keeping with the general notation, some English authors use expressions like  to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to  (actually a partial inverse; see below) Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of , which can be denoted as . To avoid any confusion, an inverse trigonometric function is often indicated by the prefix \"arc\" (for Latin arcus). For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the arcsine function, written as . Similarly, the inverse of a hyperbolic function is indicated by the prefix \"ar\" (for Latin area). For instance, the inverse of the hyperbolic sine function is typically written as . Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix \"inv\" if the ambiguity of the  notation should be avoided.\n\nProperties\n\nSince a function is a special type of binary relation, many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of inverse relations.\n\nUniqueness\n\nIf an inverse function exists for a given function , then it is unique. This follows since the inverse function must be the inverse relation which is completely determined by .\n\nSymmetry\n\nThere is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if  is an invertible function with domain  and range , then its inverse  has domain  and range , and the inverse of  is the original function . In symbols, for functions   and ,\n\nf^{-1}\\circ f \\operatorname{id}_X  and  f \\circ f^{-1} \n \\operatorname{id}_Y.\n\nThis statement is a consequence of the implication that for  to be invertible it must be bijective. The involutory nature of the inverse can be concisely expressed by \n\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^{-1} = f.\n\nThe inverse of a composition of functions is given by \n(g \\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}.\nNotice that the order of  and  have been reversed; to undo  followed by , we must first undo  and then undo .\n\nFor example, let  and let .  Then the composition  is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five,\n(g \\circ f)(x) = 3x + 5.\nTo reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three,\n(g \\circ f)^{-1}(x) = \\tfrac13(x - 5).\nThis is the composition\n.\n\nSelf-inverses\n\nIf  is a set, then the identity function on  is its own inverse:\n\n{\\operatorname{id}_X}^{-1} = \\operatorname{id}_X.\n\nMore generally, a function  is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition  is equal to . Such a function is called an involution.\n\nInverses in calculus\n\nSingle-variable calculus is primarily concerned with functions that map real numbers to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through formulas, such as:\nf(x) = (2x + 8)^3 .\nA surjective function  from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of  has, for each possible  value only one corresponding  value, and thus passes the horizontal line test.\n\nThe following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:\n\nFormula for the inverse\n\nOne approach to finding a formula for , if it exists, is to solve the equation  for .  For example, if  is the function\n\nf(x) = (2x + 8)^3 \n\nthen we must solve the equation  for :\n\n\\begin{align}\n      y         & = (2x+8)^3 \\\\\n  \\sqrt[3]{y}   & = 2x + 8   \\\\\n\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8 & = 2x       \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8}{2} & = x .\n\\end{align}\n\nThus the inverse function  is given by the formula\n\nf^{-1}(y) = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8} 2.\n\nSometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.  For example, if  is the function\n\nf(x) = x - \\sin x ,\n\nthen  is a bijection, and therefore possesses an inverse function .  The formula for this inverse has an infinite number of terms:\n\n f^{-1}(y) \\sum_{n\n1}^\\infty\n \\frac{y^{n/3}}{n!} \\lim_{ \\theta \\to 0} \\left(\n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\,n-1}}{\\mathrm{d} \\theta^{\\,n-1}} \\left(\n \\frac \\theta { \\sqrt[3]{ \\theta - \\sin( \\theta )} } \\right)^n\n\\right).\n\nGraph of the inverse\n\nIf   is invertible, then the graph of the function\n\ny = f^{-1}(x)\n\nis the same as the graph of the equation\n\nx = f(y) .\n\nThis is identical to the equation  that defines the graph of , except that the roles of  and  have been reversed.  Thus the graph of  can be obtained from the graph of  by switching the positions of the  and  axes.  This is equivalent to reflecting the graph across the line\n.\n\nInverses and derivatives\n\nA continuous function  is invertible on its range (image) if and only if it is either strictly increasing or decreasing (with no local maxima or minima).  For example, the function\n\nf(x) = x^3 + x\n\nis invertible, since the derivative\n is always positive.\n\nIf the function  is differentiable on an interval  and  for each , then the inverse  will be differentiable on .  If , the derivative of the inverse is given by the inverse function theorem,\n\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^\\prime (y)  = \\frac{1}{f'\\left(x \\right)}. \nUsing Leibniz's notation the formula above can be written as\n\\frac{dx}{dy} = \\frac{1}{dy / dx}. \nThis result follows from the chain rule (see the article on inverse functions and differentiation).\n\nThe inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable multivariable function  is invertible in a neighborhood of a point  as long as the Jacobian matrix of  at  is invertible.  In this case, the Jacobian of  at  is the matrix inverse of the Jacobian of  at .\n\nReal-world examples \n\n* Let  be the function that converts a temperature in degrees Celsius to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,\n: F f(C) \n \\tfrac95 C + 32 ;\nthen its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius,\n: C f^{-1}(F) \n \\tfrac59 (F - 32) ,\nsince\n:\n\\begin{align}\nf^{-1} (f(C)) {} & f^{-1}\\left(  \\tfrac95 C + 32 \\right) \n \\tfrac59 \\left( (\\tfrac95 C + 32 ) - 32 \\right) =  C, \\\\\n& \\text{for every value of } C, \\text{ and } \\\\[6pt]\nf\\left(f^{-1}(F)\\right) {} & f\\left(\\tfrac59 (F - 32)\\right) \n \\tfrac95 \\left(\\tfrac59 (F - 32)\\right) + 32 = F, \\\\\n& \\text{for every value of } F.\n\\end{align}\n\n* Suppose  assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,\n:\\begin{align}\n f(\\text{Allan})&2005 , \\quad & f(\\text{Brad})&\n2007 , \\quad & f(\\text{Cary})&=2001 \\\\\n f^{-1}(2005)&\\text{Allan} , \\quad & f^{-1}(2007)&\n\\text{Brad} , \\quad & f^{-1}(2001)&=\\text{Cary}\n\\end{align}\n\n* Let  be the function that leads to an  percentage rise of some quantity, and  be the function producing an  percentage fall. Applied to $100 with  = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nPartial inverses\n\nEven if a function  is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a partial inverse of  by restricting the domain.  For example, the function\n\nf(x) = x^2\n\nis not one-to-one, since .  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain , in which case\n\nf^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt{y} . \n\n(If we instead restrict to the domain , then the inverse is the negative of the square root of .)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a multivalued function:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = \\pm\\sqrt{y} . \n\nSometimes this multivalued inverse is called the full inverse of , and the portions (such as  and âˆ’) are called branches.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the principal branch, and its value at  is called the principal value of .\n\nFor a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of local extrema.  For example, the inverse of a cubic function with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).\n\nThese considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of trigonometric functions.  For example, the sine function is not one-to-one, since\n\n\\sin(x + 2\\pi) = \\sin(x)\n\nfor every real  (and more generally  for every integer ).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval\n, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the arcsine.  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between âˆ’ and .  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:\n\nLeft and right inverses\n\nIf , a left inverse for  (or retraction of  ) is a function  such that\n\ng \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X . \n\nThat is, the function  satisfies the rule\n\n\\text{If } f(x) y, \\text{ then } g(y) \n x .\n\nThus,  must equal the inverse of  on the image of , but may take any values for elements of  not in the image. A function  with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function  with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in constructive mathematics. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion  of the two-element set in the reals violates indecomposability by giving a retraction of the real line to the set .\n\nA right inverse for  (or section of  ) is a function  such that\n\nf \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_Y . \n\nThat is, the function  satisfies the rule\n\nIf \\displaystyle h(y) x, then \\displaystyle f(x) \n y .\n\nThus,  may be any of the elements of  that map to  under .  A function  has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the axiom of choice).\n\nAn inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if  is a left inverse for , then  may or may not be a right inverse for ; and if  is a right inverse for , then  is not necessarily a left inverse for . For example, let  denote the squaring map, such that  for all  in , and let   denote the square root map, such that  for all . Then  for all  in ; that is,  is a right inverse to . However,  is not a left inverse to , since, e.g., .\n\nPreimages\n\nIf  is any function (not necessarily invertible), the preimage (or inverse image) of an element  is the set of all elements of  that map to :\n\nf^{-1}(\\{y\\}) \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \n y \\right\\} . \n\nThe preimage of  can be thought of as the image of  under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function .\n\nSimilarly, if  is any subset of , the preimage of  is the set of all elements of  that map to :\n\nf^{-1}(S) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in S \\right\\} . \n\nFor example, take a function , where . This function is not invertible for reasons discussed above. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:\n\nf^{-1}(\\left\\{1,4,9,16\\right\\}) = \\left\\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\\right\\}\n\nThe preimage of a single element  â€“ a singleton set  â€“ is sometimes called the fiber of .  When  is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to  as a level set.",

Applied to $100 with  = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nPartial inverses\n\nEven if a function  is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a partial inverse of  by restricting the domain.  For example, the function\n\nf(x) = x^2\n\nis not one-to-one, since .  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain , in which case\n\nf^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt{y} . \n\n(If we instead restrict to the domain , then the inverse is the negative of the square root of .)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a multivalued function:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = \\pm\\sqrt{y} . \n\nSometimes this multivalued inverse is called the full inverse of , and the portions (such as  and âˆ’) are called branches.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the principal branch, and its value at  is called the principal value of .\n\nFor a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of local extrema.  For example, the inverse of a cubic function with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).\n\nThese considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of trigonometric functions.  For example, the sine function is not one-to-one, since\n\n\\sin(x + 2\\pi) = \\sin(x)\n\nfor every real  (and more generally  for every integer ).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval\n, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the arcsine.  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between âˆ’ and .  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:\n\nLeft and right inverses\n\nIf , a left inverse for  (or retraction of  ) is a function  such that\n\ng \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X . \n\nThat is, the function  satisfies the rule\n\n\\text{If } f(x) y, \\text{ then } g(y) \n x .\n\nThus,  must equal the inverse of  on the image of , but may take any values for elements of  not in the image. A function  with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function  with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in constructive mathematics. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion  of the two-element set in the reals violates indecomposability by giving a retraction of the real line to the set .\n\nA right inverse for  (or section of  ) is a function  such that\n\nf \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_Y . \n\nThat is, the function  satisfies the rule\n\nIf \\displaystyle h(y) x, then \\displaystyle f(x) \n y .\n\nThus,  may be any of the elements of  that map to  under .  A function  has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the axiom of choice).\n\nAn inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if  is a left inverse for , then  may or may not be a right inverse for ; and if  is a right inverse for , then  is not necessarily a left inverse for . For example, let  denote the squaring map, such that  for all  in , and let   denote the square root map, such that  for all . Then  for all  in ; that is,  is a right inverse to . However,  is not a left inverse to , since, e.g., .\n\nPreimages\n\nIf  is any function (not necessarily invertible), the preimage (or inverse image) of an element  is the set of all elements of  that map to :\n\nf^{-1}(\\{y\\}) \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \n y \\right\\} . \n\nThe preimage of  can be thought of as the image of  under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function .\n\nSimilarly, if  is any subset of , the preimage of  is the set of all elements of  that map to :\n\nf^{-1}(S) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in S \\right\\} . \n\nFor example, take a function , where . This function is not invertible for reasons discussed above. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:\n\nf^{-1}(\\left\\{1,4,9,16\\right\\}) = \\left\\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\\right\\}\n\nThe preimage of a single element  â€“ a singleton set  â€“ is sometimes called the fiber of .  When  is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to  as a level set. Inverse function. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=14907."
