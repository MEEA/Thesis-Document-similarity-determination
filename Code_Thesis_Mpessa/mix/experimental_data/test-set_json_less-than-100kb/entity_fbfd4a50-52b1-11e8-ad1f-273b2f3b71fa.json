They are east of the Philippine Islands, and north of the island of New Guinea. The federal capital is Palikir, on Pohnpei island.\n\nThe 607 islands are grouped into four states, and from west to east are: \n*Yap State\n*Chuuk State  — before 1990 named Truk.\n*Pohnpei State  — before 1985 named Ponape.\n*Kosrae State\n\nSeparated from the main islands in southern Pohnpei State are the two islands of Nukuoro and Kapingamarangi. They are geographically part of the Micronesia region, but are linguistically and culturally part of the Polynesia region.
