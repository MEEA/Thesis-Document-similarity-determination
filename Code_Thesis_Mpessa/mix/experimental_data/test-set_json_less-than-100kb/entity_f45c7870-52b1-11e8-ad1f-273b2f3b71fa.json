It was this extensive samurai class which defined the character of Edo, particularly in contrast to the two major cities of Kyoto and Osaka neither of which were ruled by a daimyō or had a significant samurai population.

The area known as Shitamachi (下町, \"lower town\" or \"downtown\"), northeast of the castle, was a center of urban culture.

Fishermen, craftsmen and other producers and retailers operated here.
