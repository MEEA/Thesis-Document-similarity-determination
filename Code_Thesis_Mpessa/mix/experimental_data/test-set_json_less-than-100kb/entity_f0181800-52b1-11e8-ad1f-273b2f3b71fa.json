  "textBody" : "Edward Estlin \"E. E.\" Cummings (October 14, 1894 – September 3, 1962), often styled as e e cummings, as he sometimes signed his name, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.\n\nLife\n\nEarly years\n\nEdward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known Unitarian couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church in Boston, Massachusetts.Collins, Leo W. This is Our Church. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104. His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts. Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison, New Hampshire, where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby Joy Farm where Cummings had his primary summer residence.\n\nHe expressed transcendental leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an \"I, Thou\" relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to \"le bon Dieu,\" as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as \"Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen.\"). Cummings \"also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; & may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness').\"\n\nCummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and received an advanced degree from the university in 1916. In his studies at Harvard, he developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax, while aiming for a dynamic use of language. Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.\n\nWar years\n\nIn 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps, along with his college friend John Dos Passos. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings was not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time he stayed in Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.\n\nDuring their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.Friedman, Norman \"Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]\", in Steven Serafin, The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature, 2003, Continuum, p. 244. On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and a friend, William Slater Brown, were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for 3½ months in a military detention camp at the Dépôt de Triage, in La Ferté-Macé, Orne, Normandy.\n\nThey were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President Wilson. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, The Enormous Room (1922), about which F. Scott Fitzgerald said, \"Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—The Enormous Room by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality.\"Bloom, p. 1814. \n\nCummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the 12th Division at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, until November 1918.Kennedy, p. 186.\n\nPost-war years\n\nCummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection Tulips and Chimneys was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. XLI Poems was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist Pablo Picasso. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the Soviet Union, recounting his experiences in Eimi, published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and Mexico. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for Vanity Fair magazine (1924–1927).\n\nIn 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car accident; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the accident in the following passage from his i: six nonlectures series given at Harvard (as part of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures) in 1952 and 1953:\n\nA locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.\n\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\".\n\nIn the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.\n\nFinal years\n\nIn 1952, his alma mater, Harvard University, awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as i: six nonlectures.\n\nCummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, Joy Farm, in Silver Lake, New Hampshire. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in North Conway, New Hampshire at the Memorial Hospital.\n\nCummings' papers are held at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarriages\n\nCummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.\n\nCummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to Scofield Thayer, one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.Selected Poems, Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994. After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.\n\nCummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a Mexican divorce; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a common-law marriage until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies, The New York Times, May 19, 1969. while living at 4 Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.\n\nPolitical views\n\nAccording to his testimony in EIMI, Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 \"The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism.\"] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/ after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues. Despite his radical and bohemian public image, he was a Republican, and later, an ardent supporter of Joseph McCarthy.Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id\no2DB77ccf9sC&pg=PA449 Google Books]\n\nWork\n\nPoetry\n\nDespite Cummings' familiarity with avant-garde styles (undoubtedly affected by the Calligrammes of French poet Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observationTaupin, Rene, The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927 (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  ), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are sonnets, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the blues form and acrostics. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of syntax, or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable modernists, including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, Cummings in his early work drew upon the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism, which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\"Friedman, Norman. E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89. Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is free verse (with no concern for rhyme or meter), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\nFATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,\nLOVE, YOU DEAR,\nESTLIN.Selected letters of E. E. Cummings, (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 \n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, The Enormous Room, Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled Tulips and Chimneys (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\" which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled Chansons Innocentes;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 Chansons Innocentes] it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to Pan, the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic R.P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is “frequently unintelligible because he [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations.”Friedman, Norman. E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.\n\nMany of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 \"why must itself up every of a park\"] but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 \"anyone lived in a pretty how town\"]\n\nCummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip Krazy Kat.\n\nControversy\n\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems.\n\nHe also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems, Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.\n\none day a nigger\ncaught in his hand\na little star no bigger\nthan not to understand\n\n\"i'll never let you go\nuntil you've made me white\"\nso she did and now\nstars shine at night.Cummings, Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.\n\nand\n\na kike is the most dangerous\nmachine as yet invented\nby even  yankee ingenu\nity(out of a jew a few\ndead dollars and some twisted laws)\nit comes both prigged and canted\n\nCummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:\n\nFriends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams spoke out in his defense.E. Cummings (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 \n\nPlays\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. HIM, a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the Provincetown Players in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, and \"Me\", his girlfriend.\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\nRelax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.\"Kennedy, p. 295.\n\nAnthropos, or the Future of Art is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word anthropos is the Greek word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\nTom, A Ballet is a ballet based on Uncle Tom's Cabin. The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] .\n\nSanta Claus: A Morality was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, Wake. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\nName and capitalization\n\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods (full stops), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today. Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\" According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect. She wrote to Friedman: \"You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer Jean Erdman presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by John Cage and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito. It was performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village.\n \nNumerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:\n* In 1961, Pierre Boulez composed \"Cummings ist der dichter\" from poems by E.E. Cummings.\n* Aribert Reimann set Cummings to music in \"Impression IV\" (1961) for soprano and piano.\n* The Icelandic singer Björk used lines from Cummings's poem \"I Will Wade Out\" for the lyrics of \"Sun In My Mouth\" on her 2001 album Vespertine. On her next album, Medúlla (2004), Björk used his poem \"It May Not Always Be So\" as the lyrics for the song \"Sonnets/Unrealities XI.\"\n* The American composer Eric Whitacre wrote a cycle of works for choir titled The City and the Sea, which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.\n* Others who have composed settings for his poems include Dominic Argento, William Bergsma, Leonard Bernstein, Marc Blitzstein, John Cage, Romeo Cascarino, Aaron Copland, Serge de Gastyne, David Diamond, John Duke, Margaret Garwood, Daron Hagen, Michael Hedges, Richard Hundley, Barbara Kolb, Leonard Lehrman, Robert Manno, Salvatore Martirano, William Mayer, John Musto, Paul Nordoff, Tobias Picker, Vincent Persichetti, Ned Rorem, Peter Schickele, Elie Siegmeister, Aki Takase, Hugo Weisgall, Dan Welcher, and James Yannatos, among many others.[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ \"E.E.

However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.\n\nCummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a Mexican divorce; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a common-law marriage until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies, The New York Times, May 19, 1969. while living at 4 Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.\n\nPolitical views\n\nAccording to his testimony in EIMI, Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 \"The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism.\"] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/ after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues. Despite his radical and bohemian public image, he was a Republican, and later, an ardent supporter of Joseph McCarthy.Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id\no2DB77ccf9sC&pg=PA449 Google Books]\n\nWork\n\nPoetry\n\nDespite Cummings' familiarity with avant-garde styles (undoubtedly affected by the Calligrammes of French poet Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observationTaupin, Rene, The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927 (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  ), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are sonnets, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the blues form and acrostics. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of syntax, or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable modernists, including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, Cummings in his early work drew upon the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism, which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\"Friedman, Norman. E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89. Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is free verse (with no concern for rhyme or meter), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\nFATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,\nLOVE, YOU DEAR,\nESTLIN.Selected letters of E. E. Cummings, (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 \n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, The Enormous Room, Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled Tulips and Chimneys (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\" which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled Chansons Innocentes;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 Chansons Innocentes] it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to Pan, the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic R.P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is “frequently unintelligible because he [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations.”Friedman, Norman. E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.\n\nMany of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 \"why must itself up every of a park\"] but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 \"anyone lived in a pretty how town\"]\n\nCummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip Krazy Kat.\n\nControversy\n\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems.\n\nHe also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems, Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.\n\none day a nigger\ncaught in his hand\na little star no bigger\nthan not to understand\n\n\"i'll never let you go\nuntil you've made me white\"\nso she did and now\nstars shine at night.Cummings, Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.\n\nand\n\na kike is the most dangerous\nmachine as yet invented\nby even  yankee ingenu\nity(out of a jew a few\ndead dollars and some twisted laws)\nit comes both prigged and canted\n\nCummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:\n\nFriends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams spoke out in his defense.E. Cummings (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 \n\nPlays\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. HIM, a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the Provincetown Players in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, and \"Me\", his girlfriend.\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\nRelax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.\"Kennedy, p. 295.\n\nAnthropos, or the Future of Art is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word anthropos is the Greek word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\nTom, A Ballet is a ballet based on Uncle Tom's Cabin. The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] .\n\nSanta Claus: A Morality was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, Wake. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\nName and capitalization\n\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods (full stops), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today. Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\" According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect. She wrote to Friedman: \"You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer Jean Erdman presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by John Cage and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito. It was performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village.\n \nNumerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:\n* In 1961, Pierre Boulez composed \"Cummings ist der dichter\" from poems by E.E. Cummings.\n* Aribert Reimann set Cummings to music in \"Impression IV\" (1961) for soprano and piano.\n* The Icelandic singer Björk used lines from Cummings's poem \"I Will Wade Out\" for the lyrics of \"Sun In My Mouth\" on her 2001 album Vespertine. On her next album, Medúlla (2004), Björk used his poem \"It May Not Always Be So\" as the lyrics for the song \"Sonnets/Unrealities XI.\"\n* The American composer Eric Whitacre wrote a cycle of works for choir titled The City and the Sea, which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.\n* Others who have composed settings for his poems include Dominic Argento, William Bergsma, Leonard Bernstein, Marc Blitzstein, John Cage, Romeo Cascarino, Aaron Copland, Serge de Gastyne, David Diamond, John Duke, Margaret Garwood, Daron Hagen, Michael Hedges, Richard Hundley, Barbara Kolb, Leonard Lehrman, Robert Manno, Salvatore Martirano, William Mayer, John Musto, Paul Nordoff, Tobias Picker, Vincent Persichetti, Ned Rorem, Peter Schickele, Elie Siegmeister, Aki Takase, Hugo Weisgall, Dan Welcher, and James Yannatos, among many others.[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ \"E.E. Cummings settings\"], RecMusic\n\nAwards\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings received numerous awards in recognition of his work, including:\n* Dial Award (1925)\n* Guggenheim Fellowship (1933)\n* Shelley Memorial Award for Poetry (1944)\n* Harriet Monroe Prize from Poetry magazine (1950)\n* Fellowship of American Academy of Poets (1950)\n* Guggenheim Fellowship (1951)\n* Charles Eliot Norton Professorship at Harvard (1952–1953)\n* Special citation from the National Book Award Committee for his Poems, 1923–1954 (1957)\n* Bollingen Prize in Poetry (1958)\n* Boston Arts Festival Award (1957)\n* Two-year Ford Foundation grant of $15,000 (1959)\n\nBooks\n\n* The Enormous Room (1922)\n* Tulips and Chimneys (1923)\n* & (1925) (self-published)\n* XLI Poems (1925)\n* is 5 (1926)\n* HIM (1927) (a play)\n* ViVa (1931)\n* CIOPW (1931) (art works)\n* EIMI (1933) (Soviet travelogue)\n* No Thanks (1935)\n* Collected Poems (1938)\n* 50 Poems (1940)\n* 1 × 1 (1944)\n* Santa Claus: A Morality (1946)\n* XAIPE: Seventy-One Poems (1950)\n*i—six nonlectures (1953) Harvard University Press\n* Poems, 1923–1954 (1954)\n* 95 Poems (1958)\n* 73 Poems (1963) (posthumous)\n* Fairy Tales (1965)\n* Etcetera: The Unpublished Poems (1983)\n* Complete Poems, 1904–1962, edited by George James Firmage, Liveright 2008.
