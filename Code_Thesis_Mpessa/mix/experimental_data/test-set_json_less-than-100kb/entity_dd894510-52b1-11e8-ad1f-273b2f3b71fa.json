We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the wild type phenotype (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation (homozygous mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, y, is responsible for the same recessive trait. The positions x and y are said to be within the same cistron when an organism that has the mutation at x on one chromosome and has the mutation at position y on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. It's important to know that cistron localization has been studied for several years, and, depending of the organism, this gene can be found in different places. For example, the gene can be found in RNA phage and is related to the cistron coat in some particular organisms. Some examples of the organisms that have been study are Tobacco, grapevine.\n\nFor example, an operon is a stretch of DNA that is transcribed to create a contiguous segment of RNA, but contains more than one cistron / gene.
