  "textBody" : "This article describes the geography of the Republic of Kiribati. Kiribati consists of 32 atolls and one island scattered over all four hemispheres in an expanse of ocean equivalent in size to the continental United States. The islands lie roughly halfway between Hawaii and Australia in the Micronesian and Polynesian regions of the South Pacific. The three main island groupings are the Gilbert Islands, Phoenix Islands, and Line Islands. On 1 January 1995 Kiribati moved the International Date Line to include its easternmost islands and make it the same day throughout the country.\n\nGeography \n\nKiribati includes Kiritimati (Christmas Atoll; in the Line Islands), the largest coral atoll (in terms of land area, not dimensions) in the world, and Banaba (Ocean Island), one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific.\n\nOceania, group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, straddling the equator, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia; note – on 1 January 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the International Date Line from the middle of the country to include its easternmost islands and make it the same day throughout the country.\n\nProtected Area \n\nThe Phoenix Islands Protected Area constitutes 11.34% of Kiribati’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and with a size of  it is the second largest marine protected area (MPA) in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nArea \n\nThe total land area mass total  811 km2. It includes three island groups - Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Phoenix Islands. Most of the land on these islands is less than two metres above sea level. Including the amount of water, the total water and land area is 2485 square miles. A 1989 United Nations report identified Kiribati as one of the countries that could completely disappear in the 21st century if steps are not taken to address global climate change.\n\nThe coastline of the islands total 1,143 km (710 mi) in length. Kiribati can claim a sea territory of 12 nautical miles (22 km, 14 mi)  with an Exclusive Economic Zone of 22 nm (370 km, 230 mi). The islands are relatively flat. The highest point is 265 metres above sea level.\n\nClimate \n\nDue to its location, Kiribati exhibits a maritime climate. Temperatures  range between 26-32 °C year-round, with the water temperature sitting on a comfortable year-round 28-29 °C. The dry season is from December to March while the wet season last from February to May and from September to November. In the driest years, the islands have received 150mm of rainfall while its wettest years saw upwards of 4000mm.\n\nLand Use \n\nThe amount of arable land is at 2.5%. Crop usage stands at about 40% of the available land. A few trees exist and occupy 10% of the land.  About 50% of the land is used for housing and commercial use.\n\nNatural Environment \n\nNatural Resources\n\nMuch of the natural resources have been exhausted before its 1979 independence. On the island of Banaba, the British mined phosphorus, which really was guano, until exhaustion of supply, an event that was before independence.\n\nNatural Hazards \n\nCyclones can occur any time, but usually November to March; occasional tornadoes; low level of some of the islands make them very sensitive to changes in sea level.The Climate Change in the Pacific Report (2011) describes Kiribati as having a low risk of cyclones; however in March 2015 Kiribati experienced flooding and destruction of seawalls and coastal infrastructure as the result of Cyclone Pam, a Category 5 cyclone that devastated Vanuatu.\n\nPollution \n\nThe island of Banaba has suffered greatly from the aftereffects of the massive phosphorus mining. Most of the population were forced to evacuate to the island country of Fiji due to its effects. In addition, the atoll near the island of Tarawa is vulnerable to the effects of solid waste disposal. A report by the United Nations say the wildlife from the region are endangered. The islands are very sensitive to the damaging effects.\n\nInternational Conventions \n\nThe country signed the Convention on Diversity on 6 August 1994.\n\nIt also signed conventions on the Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection.\n; Geography – note:\n21 of the 33 islands are inhabited; Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean - the others are Makatea in French Polynesia, and Nauru.  Kiribati is the only country in the world to fall into all four hemispheres (northern, southern, eastern, and western).\n\nExtreme points \n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Kiribati, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point – Teraina (Washington Island), Line Islands\n* Easternmost point – Caroline Island, Line Islands\n* Southernmost point – Flint Island, Line Islands\n* Westernmost point -  Banaba Island",
