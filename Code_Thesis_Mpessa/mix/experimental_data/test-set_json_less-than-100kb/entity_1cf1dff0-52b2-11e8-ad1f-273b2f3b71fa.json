The Irgun were the armed expression of the nascent ideology of Revisionist Zionism founded by Ze'ev Jabotinsky. He expressed this ideology as \"every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arab and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\".Howard Sachar: ''A History of the State of Israel, pps 265–266\n\nDuring the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs fought for the end of the Mandate and the creation of an Arab state based on the whole of Palestine. They attacked both British and Jews as well as some Palestinian Arabs who supported a Pan-Arabism. Mainstream Zionists, represented by the Vaad Leumi and the Haganah, practiced the policy of Havlagah (restraint), while Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves \"Havlagah breakers.\" The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938. While the Palestinian Arabs were \"carefully disarmed\" by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not.\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II, the Haganah and Irgun suspended their activity against the British in support of their war against Nazi Germany. The smaller Lehi continued anti-British attacks and direct action throughout the war. At that time, the British also supported the creation and the training of Palmach, as a unit that could withstand a German offensive in the area, with the consent of Yishuv which saw an opportunity to get trained units and soldiers for the planned Jewish state and during 1944–1945, the most mainstream Jewish paramilitary organization, Haganah, cooperated with the British authorities against the Lehi and Etzel.Gal-or, Noemi.

Routledge, 2004. p.74\n\nAfter World War II, between 1945 and the 29 November 1947 Partition vote, British soldiers and policemen were targeted by Irgun and Lehi. Haganah and Palmah first collaborated with the British against them, particularly during the Hunting Season, before actively joining them in the Jewish Resistance Movement, then finally choosing an official neutral position after 1946 while the Irgun and the Lehi went on their attacks against the British.Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.\n\nThe Haganah carried out violent attacks in Palestine, such as the liberation of interned immigrants from the Atlit camp, the bombing of the country's railroad network, sabotage raids on radar installations and bases of the British Palestine police. It also continued to organize illegal immigration.\n\nIn February 1947, the British announced that they would end the mandate and withdraw from Palestine and they asked the arbitration of the United Nations. After the vote of the Partition Plan for Palestine on 30 November 1947, civil war broke out in Palestine. Jewish and Arab communities fought each other violently in campaigns of attacks, retaliations and counter-retaliations which provoked around 800 deaths after two months. Arab volunteers entered Palestine to fight alongside the Palestinian Arabs. In April, 6 weeks before the termination of the Mandate, the Jewish militias launched wide operations to control the territory dedicated to them by the Partition Plan. Many atrocities occurred during this time. The Arab population in the mixed cities of Tiberias, Safed, Haifa, Jaffa, Beisan and Acre and in the neighbouring villages fled or were expelled during this period. During the Battle for Jerusalem (1948) where the Jewish community of 100,000 people was besieged, most Arab villages of the Tel Aviv – Jerusalem corridor were captured by Jewish militias and leveled.\n\nAt the beginning of the civil war, the Jewish militias organized several bombing attacks against civilians and military Arab targets. On 12 December, Irgun placed a car bomb opposite the Damascus Gate, killing 20 people.Karsh (2002), p.32 On 4 January 1948, the Lehi detonated a lorry bomb against the headquarters of the paramilitary Najjada located in Jaffa's Town Hall, killing 15 Arabs and injuring 80.Yoav Gelber, 'Palestine 1948', p.20; The Scotsman newspaper, 6th January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed, in addition to the military targets.

The Jewish society in the British Mandate Palestine generally disapproved and denounced violent attacks both on grounds moral rejection and political disagreement, stressing that terrorism is counter-productive in the Zionist quest for Jewish self-determination. Generally speaking, this precept requires that \"weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people\".Avi Shlaim, [http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf The Debate About 1948], International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27:3, 1995, pp. 287–304 But if it \"remained a central value in education\" it was \"rather vague and intentionally blurred\" at the practical level.Anita Shapira (1992), p. 252\n\nIn 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, David Ben-Gurion predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the \"principle of purity of arms\", he stressed that: \"The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds\"Anita Shapira (1992), p. 295 and during the 1948 War, the Mapam, the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked \"a strict observance of the Jewish Purity of arms to secure the moral character of [the] war\".Yoav Gelber (2006), p. 291 When he was later criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the Arab refugee problem, Ben-Gurion reminded them of the Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible for the \"outrage that had encouraged the Arabs' flight made the party uncomfortable.\"\n\nAccording to Avi Shlaim, this condemnation of the use of violence is one of the key features of 'the conventional Zionist account or old history' whose 'popular-heroic-moralistic version' is 'taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad'. Benny Morris adds that '[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by \"purity of arms\" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.' According to him, 'after the 1948 war, the Israelis tended to hail the \"purity of arms\" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.' According to him, 'this reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them \"sell\" the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy'.Morris 2008, pp. 404-406.\n\nSome Israelis justify acts of political violence. Sixty years after participating in the assassination of Count Bernadotte, Geula Cohen had no regrets. As a broadcaster on Lehi's radio, she recalled the threats against Bernadotte in advance of the assassination. \"I told him if you are not going to leave Jerusalem and go to your Stockholm, you won't be any more.\" Asked if it was right to assassinate Bernadotte, she replied, \"There is no question about it. We would not have Jerusalem any more.\"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-forgotten-hero-the-assassination-of-count-bernadotte--and-the-death-of-peace-934094.html Israel's forgotten hero: The assassination of Count Bernadotte - and the death of peace] The Independent, 18 Jan 2008 In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the King David Hotel bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun.Tom Segev, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-spirit-of-the-king-david-hotel-1.193571 \"The spirit of the King David Hotel\"], Haaretz, July 23, 2006 The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested that a plaque commemorating the bombing stated \"For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated.\" Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians, since Irgun sent warnings to evacuate the building. He said \"Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference.\" The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying \"We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated\", and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an \"act of terror\" could not be honored. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement on it accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and \"did not absolve those who planted the bomb.\"Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2277717,00.html \"British anger at terror celebration\"], The Times, July 20, 2006 To prevent a diplomatic incident, changes were made in the plaque's text. The final English version says \"Warning phone calls have been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun's regret, 92 persons were killed.\"\n\nSelected Irgun, Haganah and Lehi attacks\n\n*June 30, 1924.

Oxford University Press [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O48-SternGang.html]. by the British authorities and United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche.[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/45fc0c6e511ec0c5802564d400560ca0!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,terrorists,bernadotte Ralph Bunche report on assassination of UN mediator] 27th Sept 1948, \"notorious terrorists long known as the Stern group\"\n\nJewish public opinion\n\nDuring the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of \"Purity of arms\" was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to principle. The Jewish society in the British Mandate Palestine generally disapproved and denounced violent attacks both on grounds moral rejection and political disagreement, stressing that terrorism is counter-productive in the Zionist quest for Jewish self-determination. Generally speaking, this precept requires that \"weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people\".Avi Shlaim, [http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf The Debate About 1948], International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27:3, 1995, pp. 287–304 But if it \"remained a central value in education\" it was \"rather vague and intentionally blurred\" at the practical level.Anita Shapira (1992), p. 252\n\nIn 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, David Ben-Gurion predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the \"principle of purity of arms\", he stressed that: \"The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds\"Anita Shapira (1992), p. 295 and during the 1948 War, the Mapam, the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked \"a strict observance of the Jewish Purity of arms to secure the moral character of [the] war\".Yoav Gelber (2006), p. 291 When he was later criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the Arab refugee problem, Ben-Gurion reminded them of the Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible for the \"outrage that had encouraged the Arabs' flight made the party uncomfortable.\"\n\nAccording to Avi Shlaim, this condemnation of the use of violence is one of the key features of 'the conventional Zionist account or old history' whose 'popular-heroic-moralistic version' is 'taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad'. Benny Morris adds that '[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by \"purity of arms\" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.' According to him, 'after the 1948 war, the Israelis tended to hail the \"purity of arms\" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.' According to him, 'this reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them \"sell\" the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy'.Morris 2008, pp. 404-406.\n\nSome Israelis justify acts of political violence. Sixty years after participating in the assassination of Count Bernadotte, Geula Cohen had no regrets. As a broadcaster on Lehi's radio, she recalled the threats against Bernadotte in advance of the assassination. \"I told him if you are not going to leave Jerusalem and go to your Stockholm, you won't be any more.\" Asked if it was right to assassinate Bernadotte, she replied, \"There is no question about it. We would not have Jerusalem any more.\"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-forgotten-hero-the-assassination-of-count-bernadotte--and-the-death-of-peace-934094.html Israel's forgotten hero: The assassination of Count Bernadotte - and the death of peace] The Independent, 18 Jan 2008 In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the King David Hotel bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun.Tom Segev, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-spirit-of-the-king-david-hotel-1.193571 \"The spirit of the King David Hotel\"], Haaretz, July 23, 2006 The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested that a plaque commemorating the bombing stated \"For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated.\" Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians, since Irgun sent warnings to evacuate the building. He said \"Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference.\" The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying \"We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated\", and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an \"act of terror\" could not be honored. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement on it accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and \"did not absolve those who planted the bomb.\"Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2277717,00.html \"British anger at terror celebration\"], The Times, July 20, 2006 To prevent a diplomatic incident, changes were made in the plaque's text. The final English version says \"Warning phone calls have been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun's regret, 92 persons were killed.\"\n\nSelected Irgun, Haganah and Lehi attacks\n\n*June 30, 1924.
