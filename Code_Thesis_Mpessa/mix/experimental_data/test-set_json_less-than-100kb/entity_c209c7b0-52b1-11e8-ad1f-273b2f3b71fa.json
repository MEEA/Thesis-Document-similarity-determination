  "textBody" : "Abigail (, Avigayil) was the wife of Nabal; she became a wife of the future King David after Nabal's death (1 Samuel ). Abigail was David's third wife, after Saul's daughter, Michal, whom Saul later married to Palti, son of Laish when David went into hiding, and Ahinoam.\n\nShe became the mother of one of David's sons, who is listed in the Book of Chronicles under the name Daniel, in the Masoretic Text of the Books of Samuel as Chileab, and in the Septuagint text of 2 Samuel 3:3 as Δαλουια, Dalouia.[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/sep/sa2003.htm 2 Samuel 3], LXX Her name is spelled Abigal in  in the American Standard Version and Ab'igal in the Revised Standard Version,\n\nName \n\nDerived from the word ab, \"father\", and the root g-y-l, \"to rejoice,\" the name Abigail has a variety of possible meanings including \"my father's joy\" and the like.\"my father's joy\", \"my father rejoices\", \"my father is joy\" (or similar); from either the verbal root g-y-l \"to rejoice\" directly, or from the root noun gil \"rejoicing, joy\".

She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to \"have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed\" (verse 31, NIV) and reminding him that God will make him a \"lasting dynasty\" (verse 28).

David led the pursuit, and they were subsequently rescued.
