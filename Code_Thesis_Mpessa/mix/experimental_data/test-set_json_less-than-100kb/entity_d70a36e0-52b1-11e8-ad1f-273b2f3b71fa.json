He donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an \"industrial school\". Chalmers was run as a private institution until 1937, when the institute became a state-owned university. In 1994, the school was incorporated as an\naktiebolag under the control of the Swedish Government, the faculty and the Student Union. Chalmers is one of only three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being Karolinska Institutet and Linnaeus University.\n\nDepartments\n\nBeginning 1 May 2017, Chalmers have 13 departments.\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ace/ Architecture and Civil Engineering]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/bio/ Biology and Biological Engineering]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/chem/ Chemistry and Chemical Engineering]\n* Communication and Learning in Science\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/sv/institutioner/cse/ Computer Science and Engineering]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/ Electrical Engineering]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/ Industrial and Materials Science] \n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/ Mathematical Sciences]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/m2/ Mechanics and Maritime Sciences]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/sv/institutioner/mc2/ Microtechnology and Nanoscience]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/physics/ Physics]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/see/ Space, Earth and Environment]\n* [http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/tme/ Technology Management and Economics]\nIn addition to these, Chalmers is home to eight Areas of Advance and six national competence centres in key fields like Mathematical Modelling, Environmental Science and Vehicle Safety ([http://www.chalmers.se/safer/EN/ SAFER]).\n\nResearch infrastructure \n\nChalmers University of Technology's research infrastructure includes everything from advanced real or virtual labs to large databases, computer capacity for large-scale calculations and magnificent research facilities. \n* Chalmers Centre for Computational Science and Engineering, C3SE\n* Chalmers Mass Spectrometry Infrastructure, CMSI\n* Chalmers Power Central\n* Chalmers Materials Analysis Laboratory\n* Chalmers Simulator Centre\n* Chemical Imaging Infrastructure\n* Facility for Computational Systems Biology\n* HSB Living Lab\n* Nanofabrication Laboratory\n* Onsala Space Observatory\n* Revere – Chalmers Resource for Vehicle Research\n* The National laboratory in terahertz characterisation\n\nStudents\n\nApproximately 40% of Sweden's graduate engineers and architects are educated at Chalmers. Each year, around 250 post graduate degrees are awarded as well as 850 graduate degrees. About 1,000 post-graduate students attend programmes at the university and many students are taking Master of Science engineering programmes and the Master of Architecture programme. From 2007, all Master's programmes are taught in English for both national and international students. This was a result of the adaptation to the Bologna process that started in 2004 at Chalmers (as the first technical university in Sweden).\nCurrently, about 10% of all students at Chalmers come from countries outside Sweden to enroll in a Master's or PhD program.\n\nAround 2,700 students also attend Bachelor of Science engineering programmes, merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at Campus Lindholmen. Chalmers also shares some students with Gothenburg University in the joint IT University project. The IT University focuses exclusively on information technology and offers Bachelor and Master programmes with degrees issued from either Chalmers or Gothenburg University, depending on the programme.\n\nChalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society.\n\nOrganization \n\nChalmers is an aktiebolag with 100 shares à 1,000 SEK,[http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/chalmers-university-of-technology-foundation/Pages/statutes.aspx Statutes of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 3] (this is a translation of the [http://www.chalmers.se/sections/om_chalmers/stiftelsen_chalmers/stadgar swedish text] .)
