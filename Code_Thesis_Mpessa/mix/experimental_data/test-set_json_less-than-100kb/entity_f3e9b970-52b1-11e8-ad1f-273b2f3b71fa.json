  "textBody" : "Egalitarianism () – or equalitarianism – is a school of thought that prioritizes equality for all people.[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/egalitarian Egalitarian | Define Egalitarian at Dictionary.com] According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status.Arneson Richard,  \"Egalitarianism\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2002.) Web: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term has two distinct definitions in modern English:[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism Egalitarianism – Definition – Merriam-Webster Dictionary] either as a political doctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same political, economic, social and civil rights; or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic inequalities among people, economic egalitarianism, or the decentralization of power. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.Erdal, D. & Whiten, A. (1996) \"Egalitarianism and Machiavellian Intelligence in Human Evolution\" in Mellars, P. & Gibson, K. (eds) Modeling the Early Human Mind. Cambridge MacDonald Monograph Series.\n\nForms \n\nSome specifically focused egalitarian concerns include communism, legal egalitarianism, luck egalitarianism, political egalitarianism, gender egalitarianism, racial equality, equality of outcome and Christian egalitarianism. Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.\n\nLegal egalitarianism \n\nOne argument is that liberalism provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.Rosales, José María. \"Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy.\" 20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy. Web: 12 March 2010. [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy]\n\nEquality of person \n\nThe English Bill of Rights of 1689 and the United States Constitution use only the term \"person\" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for (a) a reference to \"men\" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and (b) a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nAs the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution uses the term \"person\" stating, for example, that \"[...] nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\".\n\nEquality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \n\nAn example of this form is the Tunisian Constitution of 2014 which provides that \"men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties\".\n\nGender equality \n\nThe motto \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\" was used during the French Revolution and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 Rights of Man and of the Citizen French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of men, but not of women. This was satirized by Olympe de Gouges during this time with her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the United States is an example of an assertion of equality of men, but not of women under natural rights, with its language \"all men are created equal\". This assertion may be understood by the use of \"man\" or \"men\" as a proper noun in the sense of \"mankind\". John Locke is sometimes considered the founder of this form.\n\nSome of the framers of the United States Constitution, most notably John Dickinson, refused to sign the Declaration of Independence in part because of this use of \"rights of man\" rather than \"rights of person\".\n\nMany state constitutions in the United States also use \"rights of man\" language rather than \"rights of person\" (see the Kentucky State Constitution).\n\nIt is generally accepted by egalitarians that some feminists have given up equal thinking and only focused on women's rights and the exclusion of other gender rights. By the original definition, feminism falls under egalitarianism and some feminists identify as egalitarian.\n\nSocial egalitarianism \n\nAt a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are socialism, communism, social anarchism, libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, and progressivism, some of which propound economic egalitarianism. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among intellectuals and in the general populations of many countries. However, whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. A position of opposition to egalitarianism is antiegalitarianism.Sidanius, Jim, et al. \"Social dominance orientation, anti‐egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: an extension and cross‐cultural replication.\" European Journal of Social Psychology 30.1 (2000): 41-67.\n\nEconomic \n\nAn early example of equality of outcome economic egalitarianism is Xu Xing, a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of agriculturalism, who supported the fixing of prices and in which all similar goods and services, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price.\n\nIn socialism, social ownership of means of production is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership, the surplus product generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist Karl Marx is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. However, Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific economic systems.\n\nThe American economist John Roemer has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of distributive justice, shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, by Roemer, John. 2008. Eastern Economic Journal, vol. 34, issue 1, pp. 14–26.\n\nEgalitarianism and non-human animals \n\nMany philosophers, including Ingmar Persson,Persson, I. (1993) “A basis for (interspecies) equality”, in Cavalieri, P. & Singer, P. (eds.) The Great Ape Project, New York: St. Martin’s Press, pp. 183-193. Peter Vallentyne, Vallentyne, P. (2005) “Of mice and men: Equality and animals”, Journal of Ethics, 9, pp. 403-433. Nils Holtug, Holtug, N. (2007) “Equality for animals,” in Ryberg, J.; Petersen, T. S. & Wolf, C. (eds.) New waves in applied ethics, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 1-24. and Lewis Gompertz Gompertz, L. (1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate. have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"Egalitarianism implies rejecting speciesism, and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals as well as assisting them [ in nature ].\"Horta, Oscar (2014) \"Egalitarianism and Animals,\" Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.\nAvailable at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5 Furthermore, Horta argues that \"because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests nonhuman animals.\"Horta, Oscar (2014) \"Egalitarianism and Animals,\" Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.\nAvailable at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5\n\nReligious and spiritual egalitarianism \n\nSikhism \n\nThe Sikh faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race, but also between the genders. This equality led to denunciation of sati, the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the funeral pyres of deceased husbands, albeit being very rare at the time, but occurred  due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation than becoming the bounty of war for the marauding jihadists that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars. The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God. Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism, many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism, with greater rigidity than the Hindu archetype from which the practice was inherited.Darshan, S. T. \"7 Sikhism and development: a perfect match?.\" Handbook of Research on Development and Religion (2013): 97.  Despite the rhetoric of equality, scholars have \"found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes\". Furthermore, despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism, denouncing sexism, female infanticide, dowry, sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolation—the reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent, like Hindus, Buddhists and Jains.Singh, I. J. \"What sikhism says about gender and sex.\" International Sikh Conferences. 2004.\n\nChristianity \n\nThe Christian egalitarian view holds that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of Jesus Christ, God and the overarching principles of scripture.Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. \n\nWithin the wide range of Christianity there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are complementarians and patriarchalists. There are also those who may say that whilst the Bible encourages equality, it also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children and the view that wife should submit to her husband and husband's should in return love their wives. These ideas are considered by some to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism. At its foundation,  holds: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" – defining all as equal in the sight of God. Similarly,  says: \"Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all\", defining all as equal in the sight of God in relationship to faith in Jesus Christ. Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities. In Acts, chapter 2, members of the early Christian community sell their possessions, give the proceeds to a common fund overseen by the disciples, then take \"according to their need\". One of the most notable of present-day communities are the Hutterite groups of Europe and North America, living in agricultural and collective communities.\n\nJudaism \n\nJudaism is not a universalist religion and teaches that Jews (defined as either the biological descendants of Jacob \"Israel\", the son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with God as a chosen people (Deutoronomy 7:6 \"chosen as God's treasured people\") to serve as an example of God's light to the rest of the world. The oral Torah and Rabbinic literature codified in the Talmud makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the gentiles (literally, \"the nations\"). However, Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the Seven Laws of Noah. In this aspect, Judaism is universalist in its divine message, but not in its religious obligations. In reform and conservative Judaism, egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. Synagogues that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e. no mechitza) and allow women to lead services with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the Torah.\n\nIslam \n\nThe Islamic stance on equality is not similar to that of Christianity it doesn't stress that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender, class and race. The Quran states: \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted\".The Quran 49:13 – English translation by Saheeh International Louise Marlow's Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.\n\nMilitary egalitarianism \n\nMilitary egalitarianism has been noted since ancient times, such as with Shakespeare's St Crispin's Day Speech. This occurs in spite of the distinctions military forces attempt to make between officers and enlisted men. For example, former Major General Charles J. Dunlap, Jr. said that United States Air Force culture included an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft.\n\nModern egalitarianism theory \n\nModern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory (or  \"new egalitarianism\") outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost, then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents—these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.\n\nReception  \n\nThe cultural theory of risk holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles; and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with fatalism termed as its opposite. The theory distinguishes between hierarchists, who are positive towards both rules and groups; and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups, but negative towards rules.Thompson et al., Cultural Theory (1990) This is by definition a form of \"anarchist equality\" as referred to by Berkman. The fabric of an \"egalitarianist society\" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit peer pressure rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, individualist, fatalist or autonomist, will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles. Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.\n\nAlexander Berkman suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse\".Alexander Berkman What is Anarchism? pp. 164–165.\n\nMarxism \n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels believed that a revolution would bring about a socialist society which would then eventually give way to a communist stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".\n\nHowever, Marxism rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of \"equality\"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires—thus Marx's notion of communist society is radically individualistic.Karl Marx on Equality, by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: \"Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes ... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed.\"\n\nMarx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: \"To each according to his contribution\" and \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.Rejecting Egalitarianism, by Nielsen, Kai. 1987. Political Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 411–423.",

However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, individualist, fatalist or autonomist, will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles. Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.\n\nAlexander Berkman suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse\".Alexander Berkman What is Anarchism? pp. 164–165.\n\nMarxism \n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels believed that a revolution would bring about a socialist society which would then eventually give way to a communist stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".\n\nHowever, Marxism rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of \"equality\"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires—thus Marx's notion of communist society is radically individualistic.Karl Marx on Equality, by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: \"Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes ... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed.\"\n\nMarx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: \"To each according to his contribution\" and \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.Rejecting Egalitarianism, by Nielsen, Kai. 1987.
