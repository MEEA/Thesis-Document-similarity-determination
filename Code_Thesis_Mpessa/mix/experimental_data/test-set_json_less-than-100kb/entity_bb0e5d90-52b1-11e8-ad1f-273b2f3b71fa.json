  "textBody" : "“Hymn to Proserpine” is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in Poems and Ballads in 1866.  The poem is addressed to the goddess Proserpina, the Roman equivalent of Persephone, but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.\n\nThe epigraph at the beginning of the poem is the phrase Vicisti, Galilaee, Latin for \"You have conquered, O Galilean\", the apocryphal dying words of the Emperor Julian.  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of Christianity by the Roman Empire.  The poem is cast in the form of a lament by a person professing the paganism of classical antiquity and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of Christianity.  Lines 35 and 36 express this best:\n\nThou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;\nWe have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.\n\nThe line \"Time and the Gods are at strife\" inspired the title of Lord Dunsany's Time and the Gods.\n\nThe poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in Thomas Hardy's 1895 novel, Jude the Obscure and also by Edward Ashburnham in Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier.",
