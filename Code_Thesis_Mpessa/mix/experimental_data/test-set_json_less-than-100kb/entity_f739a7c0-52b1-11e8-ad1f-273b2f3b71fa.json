  "textBody" : "The economy of the Faroe Islands was the 166th largest in the world in 2014, having a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.613 billion per annum.\n\nHigh dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants.  Petroleum found close to the Faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity.  Also important are the annual subsidy from Denmark, which amounts to about 3% of the GDP.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fo.html Information about the economy of the Faroe Islands]\n\nThe Faroes have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this is not necessarily a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries once they are finished with high school.  This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to take IT positions in business and industry.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the severe economic troubles of the early 1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch and poor management of the economy, the Faroe Islands have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in mid-1998, and holding below 3% since 2006, one of the lowest rates in Europe.\n\nSince 2000, new information technology and business projects have been fostered in the Faroe Islands to attract new investment.  The result from these projects is not yet known but is hoped to bring a better market economy to the Faroe Islands.\n\nTrade\n\nIn 2014 the Faroe Islands had a trade surplus of 401 million DKK, a figure that rose to 1.43 billion DKK in 2016.  As of 2016, the Faroe Islands mainly imported goods from Denmark (2,467 million DKK), Germany (877 million DKK), and Norway (610 DKK). The country's top export destinations were Russia (1,907 million DKK), the United States (898 million DKK), the United Kingdom (851 million DKK),  and Denmark (697 million DKK). European Union countries constituted 72.9% of total Faroese imports, while the exports of the Faroes Islands were more equally distributed between European Union (44.4%) and non-European Union coutries (55.6%). The vast majority of Faroese exports, almost 95%, consists of fishery products. Russian countersanctions on food imports from Norway and the European Union, saw the Faroe Islands increase its fresh salmon exports to Russia.    \n\nEnergy \n\nIn 2014 217,547 tonnes of oil products were consumed in the Faroe Islands. Of this 31.58% was consumed by fishing vessels, 14.73% was used by SEV for electricity production, 23.23% was consumed in air, sea or land transport, 9.6 was used in the industry, and the rest was used in public or private buildings.\n\nThe islands have 6 hydroelectric plants,[http://www.sev.fo/Default.aspx?ID149 Hydro electric power] 4 diesel plants[http://www.sev.fo/Default.aspx?ID\n148 Thermal Power] and several wind power plants with a capacity factor above 40%.Terji Nielsen.
