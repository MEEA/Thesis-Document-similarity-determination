  "textBody" : "Euler's formula, named after Leonhard Euler, is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. Euler's formula states that for any real number \n\ne^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x,\n\nwhere  is the base of the natural logarithm,  is the imaginary unit, and  and  are the trigonometric functions cosine and sine respectively, with the argument  given in radians. This complex exponential function is sometimes denoted  (\"cosine plus i sine\"). The formula is still valid if  is a complex number, and so some authors refer to the more general complex version as Euler's formula.\n\nEuler's formula is ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, and engineering. The physicist Richard Feynman called the equation \"our jewel\" and \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\".\n\nWhen x \\pi, Euler's formula evaluates to e^{i \\pi} + 1 \n 0, which is known as Euler's identity.\n\nHistory\n\nJohann Bernoulli noted that\n\n\\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \\frac12 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - ix} + \\frac{1}{1 + ix}\\right).\n\nAnd since\n\n\\int \\frac{dx}{1 + ax} = \\frac{1}{a} \\ln(1 + ax) + C,\n\nthe above equation tells us something about complex logarithms by relating natural logarithms to imaginary (complex) numbers. Bernoulli, however, did not evaluate the integral.\n\nBernoulli's correspondence with Euler (who also knew the above equation) shows that Bernoulli did not fully understand complex logarithms. Euler also suggested that the complex logarithms can have infinitely many values.\n\nMeanwhile, Roger Cotes in 1714 discovered that\n\nix = \\ln(\\cos x + i\\sin x).\n\nCotes missed the fact that a complex logarithm can have infinitely many values, differing by multiples of , due to the periodicity of the trigonometric functions.\n\nAround 1740 Euler turned his attention to the exponential function instead of logarithms and obtained the formula used today that is named after him. It was published in 1748, obtained by comparing the series expansions of the exponential and trigonometric expressions.Leonard Euler (1748) [http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/introductiontoanalysisvolone/ch8vol1.pdf Chapter 8: On transcending quantities arising from the circle] of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite, page 214, section 138 (translation by Ian Bruce, pdf link from 17 century maths).\n\nThe view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane was described about 50 years later by Caspar Wessel.\n\nApplications in complex number theory\n\n;Interpretation of the formula\n\nThis formula can be interpreted as saying that the function  is a unit complex number, i.e., it traces out the unit circle in the complex plane as  ranges through the real numbers. Here  is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counterclockwise and in radians.\n\nThe original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function  (where  is a complex number) and of  and  for real numbers  (see below). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers .\n\nA point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written in cartesian coordinates. Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates. The polar form simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers. Any complex number , and its complex conjugate, , can be written as\n\n\\begin{align}\nz &x + iy \n |z| (\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi) = r e^{i \\varphi}, \\\\\n\\bar{z} &x - iy \n |z| (\\cos \\varphi - i\\sin \\varphi) = r e^{-i \\varphi},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere\nis the real part,\nis the imaginary part,\nis the magnitude of \n.\n\n is the argument of , i.e., the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise in radians, which is defined up to addition of . Many texts write  instead of , but the first equation needs adjustment when . This is because for any real  and  not both zero the angles of the vectors  and  differ by  radians, but have the identical value of .\n\n;Use of the formula to define the logarithm of complex numbers\n\nNow, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number. To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm (as the inverse operator of exponentiation):\n\na = e^{\\ln a}, \n\nand that\n\ne^a e^b = e^{a + b}, \n\nboth valid for any complex numbers  and .\n\nTherefore, one can write:\n\nz |z| e^{i \\varphi} \n e^{\\ln|z|} e^{i \\varphi} = e^{\\ln|z| + i \\varphi}\n\nfor any . Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that\n\n\\ln z = \\ln|z| + i \\varphi,\n\nand in fact this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm. The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because  is multi-valued.\n\nFinally, the other exponential law\n\n\\left(e^a\\right)^k = e^{a k},\n\nwhich can be seen to hold for all integers , together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities, as well as de Moivre's formula.\n\nRelationship to trigonometry\n\nEuler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos x &\\operatorname{Re} \\left(e^{ix}\\right) \n\\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}, \\\\\n\\sin x &\\operatorname{Im} \\left(e^{ix}\\right) \n\\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas:\n\n\\begin{align}\ne^{ix}  &= \\cos x + i \\sin x, \\\\\ne^{-ix} &\\cos(- x) + i \\sin(- x) \n \\cos x - i \\sin x\n\\end{align}\n\nand solving for either cosine or sine.\n\nThese formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments . For example, letting , we have:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos(iy) &\\frac{e^{-y} + e^y}{2} \n \\cosh(y), \\\\\n\\sin(iy) &\\frac{e^{-y} - e^y}{2i} \n i \\frac{e^y - e^{-y}}{2} = i\\sinh(y).\n\\end{align}\n\nComplex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components. One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials. After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued. For example:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos x\\cdot \\cos y &= \\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iy}+e^{-iy}}{2} \\\\\n &= \\frac12\\cdot \\frac{e^{i(x+y)}+e^{i(x-y)}+e^{i(-x+y)}+e^{i(-x-y)}}{2} \\\\\n &= \\frac12 \\bigg( \\underbrace{ \\frac{e^{i(x+y)} + e^{-i(x+y)}}{2} }_{\\cos(x+y)} + \\underbrace{ \\frac{e^{i(x-y)} + e^{-i(x-y)}}{2} }_{\\cos(x-y)} \\bigg).\n\\end{align}\n\nAnother technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a complex expression and perform the manipulations on the complex expression. For example:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos(nx) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left(e^{inx}\\right) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot e^{ix} \\right) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\Big( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot \\big(\\underbrace{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}_{2\\cos x } - e^{-ix}\\big) \\Big) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot 2\\cos x - e^{i(n-2)x} \\right) \\\\\n &= \\cos[(n-1)x] \\cdot [2 \\cos(x)] - \\cos[(n-2)x].\n\\end{align}\n\nThis formula is used for recursive generation of  for integer values of  and arbitrary  (in radians).\n\nSee also Phasor arithmetic.\n\nTopological interpretation\n\nIn the language of topology, Euler's formula states that the imaginary exponential function  is a (surjective) morphism of topological groups from the real line  to the unit circle . In fact, this exhibits  as a covering space of . Similarly, Euler's identity says that the kernel of this map is , where . These observations may be combined and summarized in the commutative diagram below:\n\nOther applications\n\nIn differential equations, the function  is often used to simplify solutions, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine. The reason for this is that the exponential function is the eigenfunction of the operation of differentiation.\n\nIn electrical engineering, signal processing, and similar fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sinusoidal functions (see Fourier analysis), and these are more conveniently expressed as the sum of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula. Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.\n\nIn the four-dimensional space of quaternions, there is a sphere of imaginary units. For any point r on this sphere, and x a real number, Euler's formula applies:\n\\exp(xr) = \\cos x + r \\sin x,\nand the element is called a versor in quaternions. The set of all versors forms a 3-sphere in the 4-space.\n\nDefinitions of complex exponentiation\n\nThe exponential function  for real values of  may be defined in a few different equivalent ways (see Characterizations of the exponential function). Several of these methods may be directly extended to give definitions of  for complex values of  simply by substituting  in place of  and using the complex algebraic operations. In particular we may use either of the two following definitions, which are equivalent. From a more advanced perspective, each of these definitions may be interpreted as giving the unique analytic continuation of  to the complex plane.\n\nPower series definition\n\nFor complex \n\ne^z 1 + \\frac{z}{1!} + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\frac{z^3}{3!} + \\cdots \n \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}.\n\nUsing the ratio test, it is possible to show that this power series has an infinite radius of convergence and so defines  for all complex .\n\nLimit definition\n\nFor complex \n\ne^z = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{z}{n}\\right)^n.\n\nProofs\n\nVarious proofs of the formula are possible.\n\nUsing power series\n\nHere is a proof of Euler's formula using power-series expansions, as well as basic facts about the powers of :\n\n\\begin{align}\ni^0 &1, & i^1 &\n i, & i^2 &-1, & i^3 &\n -i, \\\\\ni^4 &1, & i^5 &\n i, & i^6 &-1, & i^7 &\n -i \\\\\n&\\vdots   & &\\vdots   & &\\vdots    & &\\vdots\n\\end{align}\n\nUsing now the power-series definition from above, we see that for real values of \n\n\\begin{align}\n e^{ix} &= 1 + ix + \\frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \\frac{(ix)^5}{5!} + \\frac{(ix)^6}{6!} + \\frac{(ix)^7}{7!} + \\frac{(ix)^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n &= 1 + ix - \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{ix^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{ix^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} - \\frac{ix^7}{7!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n &= \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} - \\cdots \\right) + i\\left( x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots \\right) \\\\[8pt]\n &= \\cos x + i\\sin x .\n\\end{align}\n\nIn the last step we have simply recognized the Maclaurin series for  and .
