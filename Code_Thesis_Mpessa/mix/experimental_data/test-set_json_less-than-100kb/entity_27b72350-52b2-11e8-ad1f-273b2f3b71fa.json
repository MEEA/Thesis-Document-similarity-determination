  "textBody" : "Keith Matthew Thornton (born October 7, 1963), better known by his stage name Kool Keith, is an American rapper from The Bronx, New York known for his surreal, abstract and often profane or incomprehensible lyrics. Kool Keith has recorded prolifically both as a solo artist and in group collaborations. Kool Keith is generally considered to be one of hip-hop's most eccentric and unusual personalities.\n\nKool Keith was a cofounding member of Ultramagnetic MCs, whose debut Critical Beatdown was released in 1988. After two more albums with the group, Funk Your Head Up and The Four Horsemen, Kool Keith released his critically acclaimed solo debut album, Dr. Octagonecologyst under the name Dr. Octagon in 1996. He subsequently released a series of further independently released hip hop albums, including Sex Style and First Come, First Served (as Dr. Dooom).\n\nAfter releasing only one album on a major label, Black Elvis/Lost in Space, Kool Keith subsequently returned to independently releasing music, producing further efforts as a solo artist and in collaboration with groups such as Analog Brothers, Masters of Illusion, Thee Undatakerz and Project Polaroid. Kool Keith has also made guest appearances in collaboration with Peeping Tom and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. He was also featured on the short track DDT on Jurassic 5's album Power in Numbers. The Prodigy's hit \"Smack My Bitch Up\" was based on a sample of Kool Keith's voice saying \"Change my pitch up. Smack my bitch up.\"\n\nHistory\n\nUltramagnetic MCs (1984-1993)\n\nKool Keith began his career with the group Ultramagnetic MCs. After the release of their influential 1988 album Critical Beatdown, Thornton was reportedly institutionalized in Bellevue Hospital Center. However, he later said that the idea that he was institutionalized came from a flippant remark made during an interview, and he never expected the story to become so well known.\n\nAfter continuing with Ultramagnetic for two more albums (1992's Funk Your Head Up and 1993's The Four Horsemen), Thornton would embark on a solo career.\n\nDr. Octagon debuts (1995-1996)\n\nThornton released his first notable solo single, \"Earth People,\" in 1995, under the name Dr. Octagon. This was followed by the release of Dr. Octagonecologyst the following year. The album's production by Dan the Automator and Kutmasta Kurt, with scratching by DJ Qbert was acclaimed by critics, and the album was released nationally by DreamWorks Records in 1997, after an initial release on the smaller Bulk Recordings label (as, simply, Dr. Octagon) a year prior. DreamWorks also issued an instrumental version of the album, titled Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats).\n\nFurther releases (1997-1999)\n\nThornton followed the Dr. Octagonecologyst album with Sex Style in 1997, under the name Kool Keith.\n\nIn 1996, Thornton collaborated with Tim Dog for the single \"The Industry is Wack,\" performing under the name Ultra—the album Big Time soon followed. In 1999, he released the album First Come, First Served under the name \"Dr. Dooom\", in which the album's main character killed off Dr. Octagon on the album's opening track. The same year, on August 10, 1999, Thornton released Black Elvis/Lost in Space. It peaked at #10 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #74 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #180 on the Billboard 200, and stands as Thornton's most commercially successful project to date.\n\nCollaborations (2000-2001)\n\nOn July 25, 2000, Thornton released the album Matthew. It peaked at #47 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The same year, Thornton collaborated with Ice-T, Marc Live, Black Silver and Pimp Rex for the album Pimp to Eat, under the group name Analog Brothers, with Keith performing as Keith Korg and Ice-T as Ice Oscillator.\n\nOn June 5, 2001, Thornton released the album Spankmaster on Gothom Records. It peaked at #16 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #11 on the Top Independent Albums\tchart and #48 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.\n\nSecond Dr. Octagon album (2002-2004)\n\nIn 2002, Thornton began recording The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon with producer Fanatik J, signing a contract with CMH Records to release the album, which was eventually completed without much input from Thornton, due to a falling out over contractual terms.\n\nOn October 12, 2004, Real Talk Entertainment issued the album Dr. Octagon Part 2. The album was discontinued by court order. On June 27, The Return of Dr. Octagon was released by OCD International, an imprint of CMH, advertised as the official follow-up to Dr. Octagonecologyst. Some critics felt that it was not as good as its predecessor. Thornton stated that he liked the album, but felt that it hurt his reputation as a musician. In August, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not acknowledge the release of the OCD album.\n\nFurther collaborations and solo albums (2002 onward)\n\nThornton, Marc Live and H-Bomb formed the group KHM, releasing the album Game on November 19, 2002, changing their name to \"The Clayborne Family\" by the release of their second album.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Thornton released the album Nogatco Rd. under the name Mr. Nogatco.\n\nIn 2007, Ultramagnetic MCs released the reunion album  The Best Kept Secret. In 2009, Kool Keith released the concept album Tashan Dorrsett; a follow-up, The Legend of Tashan Dorrsett, followed two years later. In 2012, Kool Keith performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos. He has stated that he is considering retiring from music. In 2013, Keith appeared as Dr. Octagon on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs song \"Buried Alive\", from their album Mosquito. In 2015, Keith released \"Time? Astonishing!\" with producer L'Orange and began the start of his relationship with Mello Music Group. Since then, Keith also re-issued his group album with the Analog Brothers (Ice-T, Pimp Rex, Marc Live, Silver Synth) \"Pimp To Eat\" with Mello Music. Kool Keith's newest solo album \"Feature Magnetic\" is slated for release September 16, 2016  featuring MF DOOM, Slug from Atmosphere, Dirt Nasty and many others. Artwork for the \"Feature Magnetic\" album was produced by Marc Santo.\n\nThornton's [http://www.koolkeith.co.uk fan site] refers to his discography of roughly fifty album releases, most of which have been commercially released. Singles such as \"Spectrum\" continue to appear online under the artist's name, on sites such as SoundCloud and Spotify.\n\nLyrical and performance style\n\nThornton's lyrics are often abstract, surreal, and filled with non-sequiturs and juvenile humor. Thornton is also known for an explicit style focusing on sexual themes, which Thornton has referred to as \"pornocore\". In a 2007 interview, Thornton claims to have \"invented horrorcore\".\n\nThornton's lyrics are particularly dense, and he is a master of internal rhyme. His extensive use of internal rhyme pre-dates Eminem and other artists who have embraced this style.\n\nIn reference to his relationship between himself and his various stage personalities, Keith has said, \"I don't even feel like I'm a human being anymore.\"\n\nInfluence\n\nChino Moreno, singer of the rock band Deftones, has cited Kool Keith as an influence on his vocal and lyrical style.\n\nDiscography \n\nSolo albums \n\n*Dr. Octagonecologyst (1996)\n*Sex Style (1997)\n*First Come, First Served (1999)\n*Black Elvis/Lost in Space (1999)\n*Matthew (2000)\n*Spankmaster (2001)\n*Nogatco Rd.
