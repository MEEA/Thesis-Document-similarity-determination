  "textBody" : "In Greek mythology, Cerberus (;  Kerberos), often called the \"hound of Hades\", is the monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and usually is described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes protruding from parts of his body. Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by Heracles, one of Heracles' twelve labours.\n\nDescriptions \n\nDescriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads. Cerberus was usually three-headed, though not always. Cerberus had a multi-headed heritage.

An exception is the Latin poet Horace's Cerberus which has a single dog head, and one hundred snake heads.West, David, [https://books.google.com/books?idXCaYMyW1YQQC&pg\nPA108 p. 108]; Ogden 2013a, p. 107; Horace, Odes 3.11.17–20 (West, David, [https://books.google.com/books?idXCaYMyW1YQQC&pg\nPA101 pp. 101–103]) (\"a hundred snakes … triple-tongued\"), Odes [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D2%3Apoem%3D13 2.13.33–36] (\"hundred-headed\"), Odes [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus:text:1999.02.0025:book2:poem\n19 2.19.29–32] (\"triple tongue\"). Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions, Apollodorus's Cerberus has three dog heads and the heads of \"all sorts of snakes\" along his back, while the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes (who probably based his account on Apollodorus) gives Cerberus fifty heads, three of which were dog heads, the rest being the \"heads of other beasts of all sorts\".Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.389–392 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]); Frazer's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 note 1] to Apollodorus, 2.5.12.\n\nIn art Cerberus is most commonly depicted with two dog heads (visible), never more than three, but occasionally with only one.Smallwood, p. 87; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106. According to Gantz, \"Presumably the frequent variant of two heads arose from logistical problems in draftmanship,\" and Ogden wonders if \"such images salute or establish a tradition of a two-headed Cerberus, or are we to imagine a third head concealed behind the two that can be seen?\" For one-headed Cerberus, see LIMC Herakles 2553, 2570, 2576, 2591, 2621. On one of the two earliest depictions (c. 590–580 BC), a Corinthian cup from Argos (see below), now lost, Cerberus is shown as a normal single-headed dog.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 184. A relief pithos fragment (c.  590–570 BC) LIMC Herakles 2621 (Smallwood, p. 92), seems to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with snake (open-mouthed) over his back. The first appearance of a three-headed Cerberus occurs on a mid sixth century BC Laconian cup (see below).LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 185.\n\nHorace's many snake-headed Cerberus followed a long tradition of Cerberus being part snake. This is perhaps already implied as early as in Hesiod's Theogony, where Cerberus' mother is the half-snake Echidna, and his father the snake-headed Typhon. In art Cerberus is often shown as being part snake,Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA63 p. 63]. for example the lost Corinthian cup shows snakes protruding from Cerberus' body, while the mid sixth-century BC Laconian cup gives Cerberus a snake for a tail. In the literary record, the first certain indication of Cerberus' serpentine nature comes from the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500–494 BC), who makes Cerberus a large poisonous snake.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf.

According to Euripides, Cerberus not only had three heads but three bodies,Euripides Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docEur.+Her.+22 22–25]. and according to Virgil he had multiple backs.Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nVerg.+A.+6.417 6.422]. Cerberus ate raw flesh (according to Hesiod),Hesiod, Theogony [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D304 311]. had eyes which flashed fire (according to Euphorion), a three-tongued mouth (according to Horace), and acute hearing (according to Seneca).Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 788–791 (pp. 112–113)].\n\nThe Twelfth Labour of Heracles \n\nCerberus' only mythology concerns his capture by Heracles.For discussions of Heracles' capture of Cerberus, see Gantz, pp. 413–416; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?idr1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg\n268 pp. 268–269]; Ogden 2013a, pp. 104–115. As early as Homer we learn that Heracles was sent by Eurystheus, the king of Tiryns, to bring back Cerberus from Hades the king of the underworld.Homer, Iliad [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHom.+Il.+8.367 8.367–368]; compare with Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid\n942966DAA722FA1A71797BE2B6F2624E?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D601 11.620–626].

Euripides, Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nEur.+Her.+22 22–25], calls this labor the last. However according to Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.2] this labor was the eleventh and next to last, the twelfth being stealig the Apples of the Hesperides. In a fragment from a lost play Pirithous, (attributed to either Euripides or Critias) Heracles says that, although Eurystheus commanded him to bring back Cerberus, it was not from any desire to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought that the task was impossible.Pirthous TrGF 43 F1 lines 10–14 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA70 p. 70]; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.647.xml pp. 646–647]); Ogden 2013a, p. 113.\n\nHeracles was aided in his mission by his being an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Euripides has his initiation being \"lucky\" for Heracles in capturing Cerberus.Euripides Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docEur.+Her.+612 612–613]; Papadopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nO3A-MUBefHYC&pgPA163 p. 163]. And both Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus say that Heracles was initiated into the Mysteries, in preparation for his descent into the underworld. According to Diodorus, Heracles went to Athens, where Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, was in charge of the initiation rites,Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1–2]. while according to Apollodorus, he went to Eumolpus at Eleusis.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid\n9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?docApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; so also, Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.394 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ndG0GAAAAQAAJ&pgPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/48/mode/1up p. 48]).  Apollodorus adds that, since it was unlawful for foreigners to be initiated, Heracles was adopted by Pylius, and that before Heracles could be initiated, he first had to be \"cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs\"; see also Frazer's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid\n9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 note 2] to Apollodorus, 2.5.12.\n\nHeracles also had the help of Hermes, the usual guide of the underworld, as well as Athena. In the Odyssey, Homer has Hermes and Athena as his guides.Homer, Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid942966DAA722FA1A71797BE2B6F2624E?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D601 11.620–626]; compare with Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+8.18.3 8.18.3].

And Hermes and Athena are often shown with Heracles on vase paintings depicting Cerberus' capture. By most accounts, Heracles made his descent into the underworld through an entrance at Tainaron, the most famous of the various Greek entrances to the underworld.Ogden 2013a, p. 110; Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nscd8AQAAQBAJ&pgPA305 p. 305] with n. 159.

The place is first mentioned in connection with the Cerberus story in the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500–494 BC), and Euripides, Seneca, and Apolodorus, all have Heracles descend into the underworld there.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf.

However Xenophon reports that Heracles was said to have descended at the Acherusian Chersonese near Heraclea Pontica, on the Black Sea, a place more usually associated with Heracles' exit from the underworld (see below).Xenophon of Athens, Anabasis [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Anab.+6.2.2 6.2.2]. Heraclea, founded c. 560 BC, perhaps took its name from the association of its site with Heracles' Cerberian exploit.Ogden 2013a, p. 108.\n\nTheseus and Pirithous \n\nWhile in the underworld, Heracles met the heroes Theseus and Pirithous, where the two companions were being held prisoner by Hades for attempting to carry off Hades' wife Persephone. Along with bringing back Cerberus, Heracles also managed (usually) to rescue Theseus, and in some versions Pirithous as well.Gantz, pp. 291–295. According to Apollodorus, Heracles found Theseus and Pirithous near the gates of Hades, bound to the \"Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents\", and when they saw Heracles, \"they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might\", and Heracles was able to free Theseus, but when he tried to raise up Pirithous, \"the earth quaked and he let go.\"Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+Epit.+E.1.24 E.1.24]; compare with Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.396–410, 4.31.911–916 (Greek: Kiessling, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 55–56], [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA153 153]; English translation: Berkowitz, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up 48], [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n138/mode/1up 138]).\n\nThe earliest evidence for the involvement of Theseus and Pirithous in the Cerberus story, is found on a shield-band relief (c. 560 BC) from Olympia, where Theseus and Pirithous (named) are seated together on a chair, arms held out in supplication, while Heracles approaches, about to draw his sword.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+3519%22 Herakles 3519]; Gantz, p. 292; Schelfold 1966, pp. 68–69 fig. 24.

In one place Diodorus says Heracles brought back both Theseus and Pirithous, by the favor of Persephone,Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1]. while in another he says that Pirithous remained in Hades, or according to \"some writers of myth\" that neither Theseus, nor Pirithous returned.Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4D*.html#63 4.63.4]; Gantz, pp. 294–295. Both are rescued in Hyginus.Hyginus, Fabulae [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#79 79].\n\nCapture\n\nThere are various versions of how Heracles accomplished Cerberus' capture.Ogden 2013a, pp. 110–112. According to Apollodorus, Heracles asked Hades for Cerberus, and Hades told Heracles he would allow him to take Cerberus only if he \"mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried\", and so, using his lion-skin as a shield, Heracles squeezed Cerberus around the head until he submitted.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.1]; compare with Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.400–401 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]) which says that Heracles mastered Cerberus \"Covered only by his lion skin and breast piece / Apart from the rest of his weapons, just as Pluton [i.e. Hades] said\".\n\nIn some early sources Cerberus' capture seems to involve Heracles fighting Hades. Homer (Iliad 5.395–397) has Hades injured by an arrow shot by Heracles.Homer, Iliad [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHom.+Il.+5.395 5.395–397]; Kirk, p. 102; Ogden 2013a, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA110 110]–[https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA111 111]; Gantz, pp. 70, 414, 416.

A scholium to the Iliad passage, explains that Hades had commanded that Heracles \"master Cerberus without shield or Iron\".Schol. Homer Iliad 5.395–397 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA66 p. 66]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA112 p. 112]; Gantz, p. 416. Heracles did this, by (as in Apollodorus) using his lion-skin instead of his shield, and making stone points for his arrows, but when Hades still opposed him, Heracles shot Hades in anger. Consistent with the no iron requirement, on an early sixth-century BC lost Corinthian cup, Heracles is shown attacking Hades with a stone,Smallwood, pp. 96–97; Ogden 2013a, p. 111. while the iconographic tradition, from c. 560 BC, often shows Heracles using his wooden club against Cerberus.Ogden 2013a, p. 111.\n\nEuripides, has Amphitryon ask Heracles: \"Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess [i.e. Persephone]? To which, Heracles answers: \"In fight\",Euripides Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docEur.+Her.+610 610–613]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA69 pp. 69–70].

However, according to Diodorus, Persephone welcomed Heracles \"like a brother\" and gave Cerberus \"in chains\" to Heracles.Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1].

Cerberus is often shown being chained, and Ovid tells that Heracles dragged the three headed Cerberus with chains of adamant.Ovid, Metamorphoses [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.409–413].\n\nExit from the underworld \n\nThere were several locations which were said to be the place where Heracles brought up Cerberus from the underworld.Ogden 2013a, pp. 107–108, 112–113. The geographer Strabo (63/64 BC – c. AD 24) reports that \"according to the myth writers\" Cerberus was brought up at Tainaron,Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docStrab.+8.5.1 8.5.1]. the same place where Euripides has Heracles enter the underworld. Seneca has Heracles enter and exit at Tainaron.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.103.xml 663 (pp. 102–105)] (entrance), [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml 813 (pp. 112–113)] (exit). Seneca's account may reflect a much older tradition rationalized by Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf. FGrH 1 F27), see Ogden 2013a, p. 112. Apollodorus, although he has Heracles enter at Tainaron, has him exit at Troezen.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12].

The geographer Pausanias tells us that there was a temple at Troezen with \"altars to the gods said to rule under the earth\", where it was said that, in addition to Cerberus being \"dragged\" up by Heracles, Semele was supposed to have been brought up out of the underworld by Dionysus.Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.31.2 2.31.2].\n\nAnother tradition had Cerberus brought up at Heraclea Pontica (the same place which Xenophon had earlier associated with Heracles' descent) and the cause of the poisonous plant aconite which grew there in abundance.Ogden 2013a, pp. 107–108, 112; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idIr5FhAQbcfAC&pg\nPA68 pp. 68–69]; Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?idscd8AQAAQBAJ&pg\nPA305 pp. 305 ff.]; Herodorus fragment 31 Fowler (Euphorion fragment 41a Lightfoot); Euphorion, fragment 41 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272–275]); Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/14B*.html#31 14.31.3]; Ovid, Metamorphoses [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.406–419]; Pomponius Mela, 1.92; Pliny, Natural History [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus:text:1999.02.0137:book\n27:chapter2 27.4]; Schol.

Ovid, also makes Cerberus the cause of the poisonous aconite, saying that on the \"shores of Scythia\", upon leaving the underworld, as Cerberus was being dragged by Heracles from a cave, dazzled by the unaccustomed daylight, Cerberus spewed out a \"poison-foam\", which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.Ovid, Metamorphoses [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.413–419], which has Ceberus brought up from the underworld through a cave on \"the shores of Scythia, where, 'tis fabled, the [aconite] plant grew on soil infected by Cerberian teeth.\" Seneca's Cerberus too, like Ovid's, reacts violently to his first sight of daylight. Enraged, the previously submissive Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles and Theseus must together drag Cerberus into the light.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml?result\n16&rskey=CRLRlQ 797–821 (pp. 112–115)]; see also Agamemnon, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-agamemnon/2004/pb_LCL078.199.xml 859–862 (pp. 198–199)], which has Cerberus \"fearing the colour of the unknown light.\"\n\nPausanias reports that according to local legend Cerberus was brought up through a chasm in the earth dedicated to Clymenus (Hades) next to the sanctuary of Chthonia at Hermione, and in Euripides' Heracles, thought Euripides does not say that Cerberus was brought out there, he has Cerberus kept for a while in the \"grove of Chthonia\" at Hermione.Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+2.35.10 2.35.10]; Euripides, Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nEur.+Her.+610 615] (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA69 pp. 69–70]).

The lost play Pirthous (attributed to either Euripides or his late contemporary Critias) has Heracles say that he came to the underworld at the command of Eurystheus, who had ordered him to bring back Cerberus alive, not because he wanted to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought Heracles would not be able to accomplish the task, and that Heracles \"overcame the beast\" and \"received favour from the gods\".Pirithous TrGF 43 F1 Hypothesis (Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.641.xml pp. 640–641]).

From Euphorion, also comes the first mention of a story which told that at Heraclea Pontica, where Cerberus was brought out of the underworld, by Heracles, Cerberus \"vomited bile\" from which the poisonous aconite plant grew up.Schol. Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica 2.353 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nIr5FhAQbcfAC&pg=PA68 p. 68]); compare with Euphorion, fragment 41a Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272–275]).\n\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), the capture of Cerberus was the eleventh of Heracles' labors, the twelfth and last being stealing the Apples of the Hesperides.Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1, 26.1–2]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA66 p. 66]. Diodorus says that Heracles thought it best to first go to Athens to take part in the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, being at that time in charge of the initiatory rites\", after which, he entered into the underworld \"welcomed like a brother by Persephone\", and \"receiving the dog Cerberus in chains he carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men.\"\n\nIn Virgil's Aeneid (1st century BC), Aeneas and the Sibyl encounter Cerberus in a cave, where he \"lay at vast length\", filling the cave \"from end to end\", blocking the entrance to the underworld. Cerberus is described as \"triple-throated\", with \"three fierce mouths\", multiple \"large backs\", and serpents writhing around his neck. The Sybyl throws Cerberus a loaf laced with honey and herbs to induce sleep, enabling Aeneas to enter the underworld, and so apparently for Virgil—contradicting Hesiod—Cerberus guarded the underworld against entrance.Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docVerg.+A.+6.417 6.417–425]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA71 p. 71]; Ogden 2013a, p, 109; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA69 p. 69].

Later Virgil describes Cerberus, in his bloody cave, crouching over half-gnawed bones.Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nVerg.+A.+8.296 8.296–297].

According to Ovid, Heracles dragged Cerberus from the underworld, emerging from a cave \"where 'tis fabled, the plant grew / on soil infected by Cerberian teeth\", and dazzled by the daylight, Cerberus spewed out a \"poison-foam\", which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.\n\nSeneca, in his tragedy Hercules Furens gives a detailed description of Cerberus and his capture.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml?result16&rskey\nCRLRlQ 782–821 (pp. 110–115)]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA66 pp. 66–68].\nSeneca's Cerberus has three heads, a mane of snakes, and a snake tail, with his three heads being covered in gore, and licked by the many snakes which surround them, and with hearing so acute that he can hear \"even ghosts\".Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml?result16&rskey\nCRLRlQ 782–791 (pp. 110–113)]. Seneca has Heracles use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to beat Cerberus into submission, after which Hades and Persephone, quailing on their thrones, let Heracles lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away. But upon leaving the underworld, at his first sight of daylight, a frightened Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles, with the help of Theseus (who had been held captive by Hades, but released, at Heracles' request) drag Cerberus into the light.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml?result16&rskey\nCRLRlQ 797–821 (pp. 112–115)]; see also Agamemnon, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-agamemnon/2004/pb_LCL078.199.xml 859–862 (pp. 198–199)], which has Cerberus \"fearing the colour of the unknown light.\" Seneca, like Diodorus, has Heracles parade the captured Cerberus through Greece.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml?result16&rskey\nCRLRlQ 46–62 (pp. 52–53)].\n\nApollodorus' Cerberus has three dog-heads, a serpent for a tail, and the heads of many snakes on his back.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA64 pp. 64–65]. According to Apollodorus, Heracles' twelfth and final labor was to bring back Cerberus from Hades. Heracles first went to Eumolpus to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere \"empty phantoms\". Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of Acheron, and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.\n\nIn an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD Pseudo-Nonnus, Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.Pseudo-Nonnus, 4.51 (Nimmo Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?idwzZnMCP4JRIC&pg\nPA37 p. 37]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA114 p. 114].\n\nIconography \n\nThe capture of Cerberus was a popular theme in ancient Greek and Roman art.Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (LIMC), Herakles 1697–1761 (Boardman, pp. 5–16), 2553–2675 (Smallwood, pp. 85–100); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 pp. 129–132]. The earliest depictions date from the beginning of the sixth century BC. One of the two earliest depictions, a Corinthian cup (c. 590–580 BC) from Argos (now lost),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Schefold 1966, p. 68 fig. 23; Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Ogden 2013a, pp. 106, 111; Gantz, pp. 22, 413–414. shows a naked Heracles, with quiver on his back and bow in his right hand, striding left, accompanied by Hermes. Heracles threatens Hades with a stone, who flees left, while a goddess, perhaps Persephone or possibly Athena, standing in front of Hades' throne, prevents the attack. Cerberus, with a single canine head, and snakes rising from his head and body, flees right. On the far right a column indicates the entrance to Hades' palace. Many of the elements of this scene: Hermes, Athena, Hades, Persephone, and a column or portico, are common occurrences in later works. The other earliest depiction, a relief pithos fragment from Crete (c. 590–570 BC) is thought to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with a snake (open-mouthed) over his back, being led to the right.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2621%22 Herakles 2621] (Smallwood, pp. 92, 97); Ogden 2013a, p. 108. Cerberus is perhaps being led by Heracles, but only the left arm is preserved. According to Smallwood, the identification as Heracles and Cerberus is \"suggested by Dunbabin, taken as certain by Schäfer\" (p. 92), and \"too little of the fragment is preserved for a secure identification\".\n\nA mid sixth century BC Laconian cup, by the Hunt Painter, adds several new features to the scene which also become common in later works: three heads, a snake tail, Cerberus' chain and Heracles' club. Here Cerberus has three canine heads, is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes, and has a tail which ends in a snake head. He is being held on a chain leash by Heracles who holds his club raised over head.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 pp. 129–130]; Pipili, p. 5, fig. 8; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, 111 with n. 185, p. 111 with n. 230.\n\nIn Greek art, the vast majority of depictions of Heracles and Cerberus occur on Attic vases.Schefold 1992, p. 98. Although the lost Corinthian cup shows Cerberus with a single dog head, and the relief pithos fragment (c. 590–570 BC) apparently shows a single lion-headed Cerberus, in Attic vase painting, Cerberus usually has two dog heads.Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Smallwood, p. 87. Exceptions include: LIMC Heracles 2570, 2576 (one head). In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed.Smallwood, pp. 87, 93. Exceptions include: LIMC Herakles 2553, 2591, 2621 (one head), 2579 (two heads). Occasionally, in Roman art, Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head, and two smaller dog heads on either side.LIMC Herakles 2640, 2642, 2656, 2666, Smallwood, p. 93.\n\nAs in the Corinthian and Laconian cups (and possibly the relief pithos fragment), Cerberus is often depicted as part snake.Smallwood, p. 87; Ogden 2013b [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA63 p. 63]. Examples include: LIMC Herakles 2553–4, 2560, 2571, 2579, 2581, 2586, 2588, 2595, 2600, 2603–6, 2610–11, 2616, 2621, 2628). In Attic vase painting, Cerberus is usually shown with a snake for a tail, or tail which ends in the head of a snake.Smallwood, p. 87. Snakes are also often shown rising from various parts of his body, including snout, head, neck, back, ankles, and paws.\n\nTwo Attic amphoras from Vulci, one (c. 530–515 BC), by the Bucci Painter (Munich 1493),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2604%22 Herakles 2604] (Smallwood, p. 91); Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/5058D8A6-1245-4283-B7F5-51A4D3734BD5 301639]. the other (c. 525–510 BC), by the Andokides painter (Louvre F204),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2554%22 Herakles 2554] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 98); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA130 pp. 130–131], [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA131 fig. 152]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/2A5DF5DB-2CFF-4DD3-947A-0F9A51382F1A 200011]; Perseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?nameLouvre+F+204&object\nvase Louvre F 204 (Vase)]. in addition to the usual two heads and snake tail, show Cerberus with a mane down his necks and back, another typical Cerberian feature of Attic vase painting.Smallwood, pp. 8, 91. Andokides' amphora also has a small snake curling up from each of Cerberus' two heads.\n\nBesides this lion-like mane, and the occasional lion-head, mentioned above, Cerberus was sometimes shown with other leonine features. A pitcher (c. 530–500) shows Cerberus with mane and claws,LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2610%22 Herakles 2610] (Smallwood, p. 91); Buitron, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus:text:1999.04.0044:entry\n23 Worcester MA 1935.59]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/A9338627-1A1F-4AE8-B950-E4044C0DFD4E 351415]. while a first century BC sardonyx cameo, shows Cerberus with leonine body and paws.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2628%22 Herakles 2628] (Smallwood, p. 93). In addition, a limestone relief fragment from Taranto (c. 320–300 BC) shows Cerberus with three lion-like heads.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2618%22 Herakles 2618] (Smallwood, p. 92).\n\nDuring the second quarter of the 5th century BC, the capture of Cerberus disappears from Attic vase painting.Smallwood, p. 98. And after the early third century BC, the subject become rare everywhere, until the Roman period. In Roman art, the capture of Cerberus is usually shown together with other labors. Heracles and Cerberus are usually alone, with Heracles leading Cerberus.Smallwood, p. 99.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe etymology of Cerberus' name is uncertain. OgdenOgden 2013a, p. 105. refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as \"not yet successful\".  It has been claimed to be related to the Sanskrit word सर्वरा sarvarā, used as an epithet of one of the dogs of Yama, from a Proto-Indo-European word *k̑érberos, meaning \"spotted\". Lincoln (1991),Lincoln, [https://books.google.com/books?idJY77EuSuLk8C&pg\nPA96 pp. 96–97]. among others, critiques this etymology. Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the Norse mythological dog Garmr, relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root *ger- \"to growl\" (perhaps with the suffixes -*m/*b and -*r). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires Kerberos and Garmr to be derived from two different Indo-European roots (*ker- and *gher- respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\n\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by Servius (the late fourth century commentator on Virgil)—but rejected by Ogden—derives Cerberus from the Greek word creoboros meaning \"flesh-devouring\".Servius on Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA190 p. 190]; compare with Fulgentius, Mythologies 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n73mJIuYfmzEC&pgPA51 pp. 51–52]); First Vatican Mythographer, 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA73 pp. 73–74; Pepin, p. 36]); Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, 106), 173 (Pepin, p. 171); Third Vatican Mythographer, 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nsE7WnkLLt2gC&pgPA324 p. 324]). According to Ogden, 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA74 p. 74], \"creoboros is a genuine Greek word and does indeed mean 'flesh-devouring', but it has no part to play in the genuine etymology of Cerberus's name, which remains obscure\". Another suggested etymology derives Cerberus from \"Ker berethrou\", meaning \"evil of the pit\".Room, p. 88.\n\nCerberus rationalized\n\nAt least as early as the 6th century BC, some ancient writers attempted to explain away various fantastical features of Greek mythology;Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?idt4EfiGQwgh4C&pg\nPA7 p. 7]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA183 p. 183]. included in these are various rationalized accounts of the Cerberus story.Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA184 pp. 184–185]. The earliest such account (late 6th century BC) is that of Hecataeus of Miletus.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf.

In his account Cerberus was not a dog at all, but rather simply a large poisonous snake, which lived on Tainaron. The serpent was called the \"hound of Hades\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \"Hound of Hades\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPaus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].\n\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog. According to Palaephatus (4th century BC)Palaephatus, On Unbelievable Tales 39 (Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?idt4EfiGQwgh4C&pg\nPA71 pp. 71–72]). Cerberus was one of the two dogs who guarded the cattle of Geryon, the other being Orthrus. Geryon lived in a city named Tricranium (in Greek Tricarenia, \"Three-Heads\"),Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA187 p. 187]. from which name both Cerberus and Geryon came to be called \"three-headed\". Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\"\n\nIn the rationalized account of Philochorus, in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.Philochorus, FGrH 328 F18a (Plutarch, Theseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?idKH4T9CBXwEEC&pg\nPA68 pp. 68–70]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idIr5FhAQbcfAC&pg\nPA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637].

In this version of the story, Aidoneus (i.e., \"Hades\") is the mortal king of the Molossians, with a wife named Persephone, a daughter named Kore (another name for the goddess Persephone) and a large mortal dog named Cerberus, with whom all suiters of his daughter were required to fight. After having stolen Helen, to be Theseus' wife, Theseus and Perithous, attempt to abduct Kore, for Perithous, but Aidoneus catches the two heroes, imprisons Theseus, and feeds Perithous to Cerberus. Later, while a guest of Aidoneus, Heracles asks Aidoneus to release Theseus, as a favor, which Aidoneus grants.\n\nA 2nd century AD Greek known as Heraclitus the paradoxographer (not to be confused with the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Heraclitus) – claimed that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, which made Cerberus appear to be three-headed.Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA73 p. 73].\n\nCerberus allegorized\n\nServius, a medieval commentator on Virgil's Aeneid, derived Cerberus' name from the Greek word creoboros meaning \"flesh-devouring\" (see above), and held that Cerberus symbolized the corpse-consuming earth, with Heracles' triumph over Cerberus representing his victory over earthly desires.Servius on Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA190 p. 190]. For others who followed Servius in interpreting Cerberus as symbolizing the corruption of flesh, in both the literal and moral senses, see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n6KygKVV5l7YC&pgPA68 pp. 68–69]. Later the mythographer Fulgentius, allegorizes Cerberus' three heads as representing the three origins of human strife: \"nature, cause, and accident\", and (drawing on the same flesh-devouring etymology as Servius) as symbolizing \"the three ages—infancy, youth, old age, at which death enters the world.\"Fulgentius, Mythologies 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n73mJIuYfmzEC&pgPA51 pp. 51–52]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA190 p. 190].\n\nThe later Vatican Mythographers repeat and expand upon the traditions of Servius and Fulgentius. All three Vatican Mythographers repeat Servius' derivation of Cerberus' name from creoboros.First Vatican Mythographer, 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA73 pp. 73–74]; Pepin, p. 36); Second Vatican Mythographer, 173 (Pepin, p. 171); Third Vatican Mythographer, 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?idsE7WnkLLt2gC&pg\nPA324 p. 324]). The Second Vatican Mythographer repeats (nearly word for word) what Fulgentius had to say about Cerberus,Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, p. 106). while the Third Vatican Mythographer, in another very similar passage to Fugentius', says (more specifically than Fugentius), that for \"the philosophers\" Cerberus represented hatred, his three heads symbolizing the three kinds of human hatred: natural, causal, and casual (i.e. accidental).Third Vatican Mythographer 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171).\n\nThe Second and Third Vatican Mythographers, note that the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades each have tripartite insignia, associating Hades' three headed Cerberus, with Zeus' three-forked thunderbolt, and Poseidon's three-pronged trident, while the Third Vatican Mythographer adds that \"some philosophers think of Cerberus as the tripartite earth: Asia, Africa, and Europe. This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.\"Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, p. 106); Third Vatican Mythographer 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171). For others who associated Cerberus' three heads with the three continents see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id6KygKVV5l7YC&pg\nPA69 p. 69].\n\nVirgil described Cerberus as \"ravenous\" (fame rabida),Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docVerg.+A.+6.421 6.421]. and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial. Thus Cerberus came to symbolize avarice,Wilson-Okamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n5PaUAwAAQBAJ&pgPA169 p. 169]; Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n6KygKVV5l7YC&pgPA69 p. 69]. and so, for example, in Dante's Inferno, Cerberus is placed in the Third Circle of Hell, guarding over the gluttons, where he \"rends the spirits, flays and quarters them,\"Dante, Inferno [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.13–18] and Dante (perhaps echoing Servius' association of Cerbeus with earth) has his guide Virgil take up handfuls of earth and throw them into Cerberus' \"rapacious gullets.\"Dante, Inferno [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.25–27]; Lansing, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCY-sAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154 p. 154].\n\nConstellation \n\nIn the constellation Cerberus introduced by Johannes Hevelius in 1687, Cerberus is drawn as a three-headed snake, held in Hercules' hand (previously these stars had been depicted as a branch of the tree on which grew the Apples of the Hesperides).\n\nSnake genus\n\nIn 1829 French naturalist Georges Cuvier gave the name Cerberus to a genus of Asian snakes, which are commonly called \"dog-faced water snakes\" in English.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

    "aggregatedText" : "In Greek mythology, Cerberus (;  Kerberos), often called the \"hound of Hades\", is the monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and usually is described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes protruding from parts of his body. Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by Heracles, one of Heracles' twelve labours.\n\nDescriptions \n\nDescriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads.

Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions, Apollodorus's Cerberus has three dog heads and the heads of \"all sorts of snakes\" along his back, while the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes (who probably based his account on Apollodorus) gives Cerberus fifty heads, three of which were dog heads, the rest being the \"heads of other beasts of all sorts\".Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.389–392 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]); Frazer's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 note 1] to Apollodorus, 2.5.12.\n\nIn art Cerberus is most commonly depicted with two dog heads (visible), never more than three, but occasionally with only one.Smallwood, p. 87; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106. According to Gantz, \"Presumably the frequent variant of two heads arose from logistical problems in draftmanship,\" and Ogden wonders if \"such images salute or establish a tradition of a two-headed Cerberus, or are we to imagine a third head concealed behind the two that can be seen?\" For one-headed Cerberus, see LIMC Herakles 2553, 2570, 2576, 2591, 2621. On one of the two earliest depictions (c. 590–580 BC), a Corinthian cup from Argos (see below), now lost, Cerberus is shown as a normal single-headed dog.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 184. A relief pithos fragment (c.  590–570 BC) LIMC Herakles 2621 (Smallwood, p. 92), seems to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with snake (open-mouthed) over his back. The first appearance of a three-headed Cerberus occurs on a mid sixth century BC Laconian cup (see below).LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 185.\n\nHorace's many snake-headed Cerberus followed a long tradition of Cerberus being part snake. This is perhaps already implied as early as in Hesiod's Theogony, where Cerberus' mother is the half-snake Echidna, and his father the snake-headed Typhon. In art Cerberus is often shown as being part snake,Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA63 p. 63]. for example the lost Corinthian cup shows snakes protruding from Cerberus' body, while the mid sixth-century BC Laconian cup gives Cerberus a snake for a tail. In the literary record, the first certain indication of Cerberus' serpentine nature comes from the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500–494 BC), who makes Cerberus a large poisonous snake.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf.

Euripides, Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nEur.+Her.+22 22–25], calls this labor the last. However according to Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.2] this labor was the eleventh and next to last, the twelfth being stealig the Apples of the Hesperides. In a fragment from a lost play Pirithous, (attributed to either Euripides or Critias) Heracles says that, although Eurystheus commanded him to bring back Cerberus, it was not from any desire to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought that the task was impossible.Pirthous TrGF 43 F1 lines 10–14 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA70 p. 70]; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.647.xml pp. 646–647]); Ogden 2013a, p. 113.\n\nHeracles was aided in his mission by his being an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Euripides has his initiation being \"lucky\" for Heracles in capturing Cerberus.Euripides Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docEur.+Her.+612 612–613]; Papadopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nO3A-MUBefHYC&pgPA163 p. 163]. And both Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus say that Heracles was initiated into the Mysteries, in preparation for his descent into the underworld. According to Diodorus, Heracles went to Athens, where Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, was in charge of the initiation rites,Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1–2]. while according to Apollodorus, he went to Eumolpus at Eleusis.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid\n9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?docApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; so also, Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.394 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ndG0GAAAAQAAJ&pgPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/48/mode/1up p. 48]).  Apollodorus adds that, since it was unlawful for foreigners to be initiated, Heracles was adopted by Pylius, and that before Heracles could be initiated, he first had to be \"cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs\"; see also Frazer's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid\n9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 note 2] to Apollodorus, 2.5.12.\n\nHeracles also had the help of Hermes, the usual guide of the underworld, as well as Athena. In the Odyssey, Homer has Hermes and Athena as his guides.Homer, Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid942966DAA722FA1A71797BE2B6F2624E?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D601 11.620–626]; compare with Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+8.18.3 8.18.3].

And Hermes and Athena are often shown with Heracles on vase paintings depicting Cerberus' capture. By most accounts, Heracles made his descent into the underworld through an entrance at Tainaron, the most famous of the various Greek entrances to the underworld.Ogden 2013a, p. 110; Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nscd8AQAAQBAJ&pgPA305 p. 305] with n. 159. An entrance at Tainaron is mentioned as early as Pindar, Pythian [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D4 4.44]. The place is first mentioned in connection with the Cerberus story in the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500–494 BC), and Euripides, Seneca, and Apolodorus, all have Heracles descend into the underworld there.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf.

However Xenophon reports that Heracles was said to have descended at the Acherusian Chersonese near Heraclea Pontica, on the Black Sea, a place more usually associated with Heracles' exit from the underworld (see below).Xenophon of Athens, Anabasis [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Anab.+6.2.2 6.2.2]. Heraclea, founded c. 560 BC, perhaps took its name from the association of its site with Heracles' Cerberian exploit.Ogden 2013a, p. 108.\n\nTheseus and Pirithous \n\nWhile in the underworld, Heracles met the heroes Theseus and Pirithous, where the two companions were being held prisoner by Hades for attempting to carry off Hades' wife Persephone. Along with bringing back Cerberus, Heracles also managed (usually) to rescue Theseus, and in some versions Pirithous as well.Gantz, pp. 291–295. According to Apollodorus, Heracles found Theseus and Pirithous near the gates of Hades, bound to the \"Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents\", and when they saw Heracles, \"they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might\", and Heracles was able to free Theseus, but when he tried to raise up Pirithous, \"the earth quaked and he let go.\"Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+Epit.+E.1.24 E.1.24]; compare with Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.396–410, 4.31.911–916 (Greek: Kiessling, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 55–56], [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA153 153]; English translation: Berkowitz, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up 48], [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n138/mode/1up 138]).\n\nThe earliest evidence for the involvement of Theseus and Pirithous in the Cerberus story, is found on a shield-band relief (c. 560 BC) from Olympia, where Theseus and Pirithous (named) are seated together on a chair, arms held out in supplication, while Heracles approaches, about to draw his sword.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+3519%22 Herakles 3519]; Gantz, p. 292; Schelfold 1966, pp. 68–69 fig. 24.

In one place Diodorus says Heracles brought back both Theseus and Pirithous, by the favor of Persephone,Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1]. while in another he says that Pirithous remained in Hades, or according to \"some writers of myth\" that neither Theseus, nor Pirithous returned.Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4D*.html#63 4.63.4]; Gantz, pp. 294–295. Both are rescued in Hyginus.Hyginus, Fabulae [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#79 79].\n\nCapture\n\nThere are various versions of how Heracles accomplished Cerberus' capture.Ogden 2013a, pp. 110–112. According to Apollodorus, Heracles asked Hades for Cerberus, and Hades told Heracles he would allow him to take Cerberus only if he \"mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried\", and so, using his lion-skin as a shield, Heracles squeezed Cerberus around the head until he submitted.Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc\nApollod.+2.5.12 2.5.1]; compare with Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.400–401 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?iddG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg\nPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]) which says that Heracles mastered Cerberus \"Covered only by his lion skin and breast piece / Apart from the rest of his weapons, just as Pluton [i.e. Hades] said\".\n\nIn some early sources Cerberus' capture seems to involve Heracles fighting Hades. Homer (Iliad 5.395–397) has Hades injured by an arrow shot by Heracles.Homer, Iliad [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docHom.+Il.+5.395 5.395–397]; Kirk, p. 102; Ogden 2013a, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA110 110]–[https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA111 111]; Gantz, pp. 70, 414, 416.

Compare with Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml 48–51 (pp. 52–53)], where Heracles brings back \"spoils of triumph over that conquered king … subdued Dis\". A scholium to the Iliad passage, explains that Hades had commanded that Heracles \"master Cerberus without shield or Iron\".Schol. Homer Iliad 5.395–397 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA66 p. 66]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA112 p. 112]; Gantz, p. 416. Heracles did this, by (as in Apollodorus) using his lion-skin instead of his shield, and making stone points for his arrows, but when Hades still opposed him, Heracles shot Hades in anger. Consistent with the no iron requirement, on an early sixth-century BC lost Corinthian cup, Heracles is shown attacking Hades with a stone,Smallwood, pp. 96–97; Ogden 2013a, p. 111. while the iconographic tradition, from c. 560 BC, often shows Heracles using his wooden club against Cerberus.Ogden 2013a, p. 111.\n\nEuripides, has Amphitryon ask Heracles: \"Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess [i.e. Persephone]? To which, Heracles answers: \"In fight\",Euripides Heracles [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docEur.+Her.+610 610–613]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA69 pp. 69–70].

However, according to Diodorus, Persephone welcomed Heracles \"like a brother\" and gave Cerberus \"in chains\" to Heracles.Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1].

Cerberus is often shown being chained, and Ovid tells that Heracles dragged the three headed Cerberus with chains of adamant.Ovid, Metamorphoses [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.409–413].\n\nExit from the underworld \n\nThere were several locations which were said to be the place where Heracles brought up Cerberus from the underworld.Ogden 2013a, pp. 107–108, 112–113. The geographer Strabo (63/64 BC – c. AD 24) reports that \"according to the myth writers\" Cerberus was brought up at Tainaron,Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docStrab.+8.5.1 8.5.1]. the same place where Euripides has Heracles enter the underworld. Seneca has Heracles enter and exit at Tainaron.Seneca, Hercules Furens [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.103.xml 663 (pp. 102–105)] (entrance), [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml 813 (pp. 112–113)] (exit).

According to Apollodorus, Heracles' twelfth and final labor was to bring back Cerberus from Hades. Heracles first went to Eumolpus to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere \"empty phantoms\". Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of Acheron, and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.\n\nIn an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD Pseudo-Nonnus, Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.Pseudo-Nonnus, 4.51 (Nimmo Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?idwzZnMCP4JRIC&pg\nPA37 p. 37]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA114 p. 114].\n\nIconography \n\nThe capture of Cerberus was a popular theme in ancient Greek and Roman art.Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (LIMC), Herakles 1697–1761 (Boardman, pp. 5–16), 2553–2675 (Smallwood, pp. 85–100); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 pp. 129–132].

One of the two earliest depictions, a Corinthian cup (c. 590–580 BC) from Argos (now lost),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Schefold 1966, p. 68 fig. 23; Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Ogden 2013a, pp. 106, 111; Gantz, pp. 22, 413–414. shows a naked Heracles, with quiver on his back and bow in his right hand, striding left, accompanied by Hermes. Heracles threatens Hades with a stone, who flees left, while a goddess, perhaps Persephone or possibly Athena, standing in front of Hades' throne, prevents the attack. Cerberus, with a single canine head, and snakes rising from his head and body, flees right. On the far right a column indicates the entrance to Hades' palace. Many of the elements of this scene: Hermes, Athena, Hades, Persephone, and a column or portico, are common occurrences in later works. The other earliest depiction, a relief pithos fragment from Crete (c. 590–570 BC) is thought to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with a snake (open-mouthed) over his back, being led to the right.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2621%22 Herakles 2621] (Smallwood, pp. 92, 97); Ogden 2013a, p. 108. Cerberus is perhaps being led by Heracles, but only the left arm is preserved. According to Smallwood, the identification as Heracles and Cerberus is \"suggested by Dunbabin, taken as certain by Schäfer\" (p. 92), and \"too little of the fragment is preserved for a secure identification\".\n\nA mid sixth century BC Laconian cup, by the Hunt Painter, adds several new features to the scene which also become common in later works: three heads, a snake tail, Cerberus' chain and Heracles' club. Here Cerberus has three canine heads, is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes, and has a tail which ends in a snake head. He is being held on a chain leash by Heracles who holds his club raised over head.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 pp. 129–130]; Pipili, p. 5, fig. 8; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, 111 with n. 185, p. 111 with n. 230.\n\nIn Greek art, the vast majority of depictions of Heracles and Cerberus occur on Attic vases.Schefold 1992, p. 98. Although the lost Corinthian cup shows Cerberus with a single dog head, and the relief pithos fragment (c. 590–570 BC) apparently shows a single lion-headed Cerberus, in Attic vase painting, Cerberus usually has two dog heads.Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA129 p. 129]; Smallwood, p. 87. Exceptions include: LIMC Heracles 2570, 2576 (one head). In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed.Smallwood, pp. 87, 93. Exceptions include: LIMC Herakles 2553, 2591, 2621 (one head), 2579 (two heads). Occasionally, in Roman art, Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head, and two smaller dog heads on either side.LIMC Herakles 2640, 2642, 2656, 2666, Smallwood, p. 93.\n\nAs in the Corinthian and Laconian cups (and possibly the relief pithos fragment), Cerberus is often depicted as part snake.Smallwood, p. 87; Ogden 2013b [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA63 p. 63]. Examples include: LIMC Herakles 2553–4, 2560, 2571, 2579, 2581, 2586, 2588, 2595, 2600, 2603–6, 2610–11, 2616, 2621, 2628). In Attic vase painting, Cerberus is usually shown with a snake for a tail, or tail which ends in the head of a snake.Smallwood, p. 87. Snakes are also often shown rising from various parts of his body, including snout, head, neck, back, ankles, and paws.\n\nTwo Attic amphoras from Vulci, one (c. 530–515 BC), by the Bucci Painter (Munich 1493),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2604%22 Herakles 2604] (Smallwood, p. 91); Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/5058D8A6-1245-4283-B7F5-51A4D3734BD5 301639]. the other (c. 525–510 BC), by the Andokides painter (Louvre F204),LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2554%22 Herakles 2554] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 98); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA130 pp. 130–131], [https://books.google.com/books?idp2DA_Aze7F0C&pg\nPA131 fig. 152]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/2A5DF5DB-2CFF-4DD3-947A-0F9A51382F1A 200011]; Perseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?nameLouvre+F+204&object\nvase Louvre F 204 (Vase)]. in addition to the usual two heads and snake tail, show Cerberus with a mane down his necks and back, another typical Cerberian feature of Attic vase painting.Smallwood, pp. 8, 91. Andokides' amphora also has a small snake curling up from each of Cerberus' two heads.\n\nBesides this lion-like mane, and the occasional lion-head, mentioned above, Cerberus was sometimes shown with other leonine features. A pitcher (c. 530–500) shows Cerberus with mane and claws,LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2610%22 Herakles 2610] (Smallwood, p. 91); Buitron, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus:text:1999.04.0044:entry\n23 Worcester MA 1935.59]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/A9338627-1A1F-4AE8-B950-E4044C0DFD4E 351415]. while a first century BC sardonyx cameo, shows Cerberus with leonine body and paws.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2628%22 Herakles 2628] (Smallwood, p. 93). In addition, a limestone relief fragment from Taranto (c. 320–300 BC) shows Cerberus with three lion-like heads.LIMC [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source100&term\n%22Herakles+2618%22 Herakles 2618] (Smallwood, p. 92).\n\nDuring the second quarter of the 5th century BC, the capture of Cerberus disappears from Attic vase painting.Smallwood, p. 98. And after the early third century BC, the subject become rare everywhere, until the Roman period. In Roman art, the capture of Cerberus is usually shown together with other labors. Heracles and Cerberus are usually alone, with Heracles leading Cerberus.Smallwood, p. 99.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe etymology of Cerberus' name is uncertain. OgdenOgden 2013a, p. 105. refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as \"not yet successful\".  It has been claimed to be related to the Sanskrit word सर्वरा sarvarā, used as an epithet of one of the dogs of Yama, from a Proto-Indo-European word *k̑érberos, meaning \"spotted\". Lincoln (1991),Lincoln, [https://books.google.com/books?idJY77EuSuLk8C&pg\nPA96 pp. 96–97]. among others, critiques this etymology. Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the Norse mythological dog Garmr, relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root *ger- \"to growl\" (perhaps with the suffixes -*m/*b and -*r). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires Kerberos and Garmr to be derived from two different Indo-European roots (*ker- and *gher- respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\n\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by Servius (the late fourth century commentator on Virgil)—but rejected by Ogden—derives Cerberus from the Greek word creoboros meaning \"flesh-devouring\".Servius on Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA190 p. 190]; compare with Fulgentius, Mythologies 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n73mJIuYfmzEC&pgPA51 pp. 51–52]); First Vatican Mythographer, 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA73 pp. 73–74; Pepin, p. 36]); Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, 106), 173 (Pepin, p. 171); Third Vatican Mythographer, 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nsE7WnkLLt2gC&pgPA324 p. 324]). According to Ogden, 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA74 p. 74], \"creoboros is a genuine Greek word and does indeed mean 'flesh-devouring', but it has no part to play in the genuine etymology of Cerberus's name, which remains obscure\". Another suggested etymology derives Cerberus from \"Ker berethrou\", meaning \"evil of the pit\".Room, p. 88.\n\nCerberus rationalized\n\nAt least as early as the 6th century BC, some ancient writers attempted to explain away various fantastical features of Greek mythology;Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?idt4EfiGQwgh4C&pg\nPA7 p. 7]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA183 p. 183]. included in these are various rationalized accounts of the Cerberus story.Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA184 pp. 184–185]. The earliest such account (late 6th century BC) is that of Hecataeus of Miletus.Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (apud Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPaus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf. FGrH 1 F27); Hawes, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ntyuTAwAAQBAJ&pgPA8 p. 8]; Hopman, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nhb4hAwAAQBAJ&pgPA182 p. 182]; Ogden 2013a, p. 107; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pgPA72 pp. 72–73]. In his account Cerberus was not a dog at all, but rather simply a large poisonous snake, which lived on Tainaron. The serpent was called the \"hound of Hades\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \"Hound of Hades\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPaus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].\n\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog. According to Palaephatus (4th century BC)Palaephatus, On Unbelievable Tales 39 (Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?idt4EfiGQwgh4C&pg\nPA71 pp. 71–72]). Cerberus was one of the two dogs who guarded the cattle of Geryon, the other being Orthrus. Geryon lived in a city named Tricranium (in Greek Tricarenia, \"Three-Heads\"),Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?idFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg\nPA187 p. 187]. from which name both Cerberus and Geryon came to be called \"three-headed\". Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\"\n\nIn the rationalized account of Philochorus, in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.Philochorus, FGrH 328 F18a (Plutarch, Theseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc\nPerseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?idKH4T9CBXwEEC&pg\nPA68 pp. 68–70]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idIr5FhAQbcfAC&pg\nPA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637]. Compare with Plutarch,  Theseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D31%3Asection%3D1 31.1–4]; Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.36.388–411 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ndG0GAAAAQAAJ&pgPA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]), 4.31.911–916 (Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ndG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA153 p. 153]; Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n138/mode/1up p. 138]). In this version of the story, Aidoneus (i.e., \"Hades\") is the mortal king of the Molossians, with a wife named Persephone, a daughter named Kore (another name for the goddess Persephone) and a large mortal dog named Cerberus, with whom all suiters of his daughter were required to fight. After having stolen Helen, to be Theseus' wife, Theseus and Perithous, attempt to abduct Kore, for Perithous, but Aidoneus catches the two heroes, imprisons Theseus, and feeds Perithous to Cerberus. Later, while a guest of Aidoneus, Heracles asks Aidoneus to release Theseus, as a favor, which Aidoneus grants.\n\nA 2nd century AD Greek known as Heraclitus the paradoxographer (not to be confused with the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Heraclitus) – claimed that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, which made Cerberus appear to be three-headed.Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA73 p. 73].\n\nCerberus allegorized\n\nServius, a medieval commentator on Virgil's Aeneid, derived Cerberus' name from the Greek word creoboros meaning \"flesh-devouring\" (see above), and held that Cerberus symbolized the corpse-consuming earth, with Heracles' triumph over Cerberus representing his victory over earthly desires.Servius on Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pgPA190 p. 190]. For others who followed Servius in interpreting Cerberus as symbolizing the corruption of flesh, in both the literal and moral senses, see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n6KygKVV5l7YC&pgPA68 pp. 68–69]. Later the mythographer Fulgentius, allegorizes Cerberus' three heads as representing the three origins of human strife: \"nature, cause, and accident\", and (drawing on the same flesh-devouring etymology as Servius) as symbolizing \"the three ages—infancy, youth, old age, at which death enters the world.\"Fulgentius, Mythologies 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n73mJIuYfmzEC&pgPA51 pp. 51–52]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA190 p. 190].\n\nThe later Vatican Mythographers repeat and expand upon the traditions of Servius and Fulgentius. All three Vatican Mythographers repeat Servius' derivation of Cerberus' name from creoboros.First Vatican Mythographer, 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?idVv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg\nPA73 pp. 73–74]; Pepin, p. 36); Second Vatican Mythographer, 173 (Pepin, p. 171); Third Vatican Mythographer, 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?idsE7WnkLLt2gC&pg\nPA324 p. 324]). The Second Vatican Mythographer repeats (nearly word for word) what Fulgentius had to say about Cerberus,Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, p. 106). while the Third Vatican Mythographer, in another very similar passage to Fugentius', says (more specifically than Fugentius), that for \"the philosophers\" Cerberus represented hatred, his three heads symbolizing the three kinds of human hatred: natural, causal, and casual (i.e. accidental).Third Vatican Mythographer 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171).\n\nThe Second and Third Vatican Mythographers, note that the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades each have tripartite insignia, associating Hades' three headed Cerberus, with Zeus' three-forked thunderbolt, and Poseidon's three-pronged trident, while the Third Vatican Mythographer adds that \"some philosophers think of Cerberus as the tripartite earth: Asia, Africa, and Europe. This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.\"Second Vatican Mythographer, 13 (Pepin, p. 106); Third Vatican Mythographer 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171). For others who associated Cerberus' three heads with the three continents see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id6KygKVV5l7YC&pg\nPA69 p. 69].\n\nVirgil described Cerberus as \"ravenous\" (fame rabida),Virgil, Aeneid [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docVerg.+A.+6.421 6.421]. and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial. Thus Cerberus came to symbolize avarice,Wilson-Okamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n5PaUAwAAQBAJ&pgPA169 p. 169]; Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n6KygKVV5l7YC&pgPA69 p. 69]. and so, for example, in Dante's Inferno, Cerberus is placed in the Third Circle of Hell, guarding over the gluttons, where he \"rends the spirits, flays and quarters them,\"Dante, Inferno [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.13–18] and Dante (perhaps echoing Servius' association of Cerbeus with earth) has his guide Virgil take up handfuls of earth and throw them into Cerberus' \"rapacious gullets.\"Dante, Inferno [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.25–27]; Lansing, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCY-sAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154 p. 154].\n\nConstellation \n\nIn the constellation Cerberus introduced by Johannes Hevelius in 1687, Cerberus is drawn as a three-headed snake, held in Hercules' hand (previously these stars had been depicted as a branch of the tree on which grew the Apples of the Hesperides).\n\nSnake genus\n\nIn 1829 French naturalist Georges Cuvier gave the name Cerberus to a genus of Asian snakes, which are commonly called \"dog-faced water snakes\" in English.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\"Cerberus\", p. 50). Cerberus. http://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=6697."
