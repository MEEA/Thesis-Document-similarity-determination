  "textBody" : "The House of Habsburg (;, traditionally spelled Hapsburg in English), also called House of Austria[http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/house-austria-habsburgs-and-empire?language=de \"The House of Austria – the Habsburgs and the Empire\"] was one of the most influential and outstanding royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Kingdom of Illyria, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Kingdom of Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the 16th century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nThe House takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland, in the canton of Aargau, by Count Radbot of Klettgau, who chose to name his fortress Habsburg. His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding \"Count of Habsburg\" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.\n\nBy 1276, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg had moved the family's power base from Habsburg Castle to the Duchy of Austria. Rudolph had become King of Germany in 1273, and the dynasty of the House of Habsburg was truly entrenched in 1276 when Rudolph became ruler of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.\n\nA series of dynastic marriagesPaula Sutter Fichtner, \"Dynastic Marriage in Sixteenth-Century Habsburg Diplomacy and Statecraft: An Interdisciplinary Approach,\" American Historical Review Vol. 81, No. 2 (April 1976), pp. 243-265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1851170 in JSTOR] enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy, Spain and its colonial empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and other territories. In the 16th century, the family separated into the senior Habsburg Spain and the junior Habsburg Monarchy branches, who settled their mutual claims in the Oñate treaty.\n\nThe House of Habsburg became extinct in the 18th century. The senior Spanish branch ended upon the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and was replaced by the House of Bourbon. The remaining Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and completely in 1780 with the death of his eldest daughter Maria Theresa of Austria. It was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine. The new successor house styled itself formally as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Habsburg-Lothringen), and because it was often confusingly still referred to as the House of Habsburg, historians use the unofficial appellation of the Habsburg Monarchy for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the junior Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918.\n\nPrincipal roles\n\nTheir principal roles (including the roles of their cadet branches) were as follows:\n* Holy Roman Emperors (intermittently from 1273 until 1806), kings of Germany,The Kingdom of Germany was within the\nHoly Roman Empire from 962 until 1806. and kings of the RomansKing of the Romans\"\n was, from the time of Emperor Henry II (1014–1024), the title used by the German king following his election by the princes. The title King of the Romans became functionally obsolete after 1508.)\n* Rulers of Austria (as dukes from 1278 until 1453; as archdukes from 1453 until 1806/1918; as emperors from 1804 until 1918)\n* Kings of Bohemia (1306–1307, 1437–1439, 1453–1457, 1526–1918)\n* Kings of Hungary and Croatia (1526–1918)\n* Kings of Spain (1516–1700)\n* Kings of Portugal (1581–1640)\n* Kings of Galicia and Lodomeria (1772–1918)\n* Grand princes of Transylvania (1690–1867)\n\nNumerous other titles were attached to the crowns listed above.\n\nHistory\n\nCounts of Habsburg\n\nThe progenitor of the House of Habsburg may have been Guntram the Rich, a count in the Breisgau who lived in the 10th century, and forewith farther back as the early medieval Adalrich, Duke of Alsace, father of the Etichonids from which Habsburg derives. His grandson Radbot, Count of Habsburg founded the Habsburg Castle, after which the Habsburgs are named. The origins of the castle's name, located in what is now the Swiss canton of Aargau, are uncertain. There is disagreement on whether the name is derived from the High German Habichtsburg (hawk castle), or from the Middle High German word hab/hap meaning ford, as there is a river with a ford nearby. The first documented use of the name by the dynasty itself has been traced to the year 1108.\"Habsburger-Gedenkjahr im Aargau\", Neue Zürcher Zeitung, (page 17) 23 May 2008.[http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html art-tv.ch]\nThe Habsburg Castle was the family seat in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Habsburgs expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges, especially countship rights in Zürichgau, Aargau and Thurgau. In the 13th century, the house aimed its marriage policy at families in Upper Alsace and Swabia. They were also able to gain high positions in the church hierarchy for their members. Territorially, they often profited from the extinction of other noble families such as the House of Kyburg.\n\nKings of the Romans\n\nBy the second half of the 13th century, count Rudolph IV (1218–1291) had become one of the most influential territorial lords in the area between the Vosges Mountains and Lake Constance. Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October, 1273, Rudolph was chosen as the King of the Romans and received the name Rudolph I of Germany.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. .\n\nIn 1282, the Habsburgs gained the rulership of the Duchy of Austria, which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. Through the forged privilegium maius document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the house and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1339–1365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's descendants ignored the rule, leading to the separation of the Albertian and Leopoldian family lines in 1379.\n\nBy marrying Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1437, Duke Albert V (1397–1439) became the ruler of Bohemia and Hungary, expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the King of the Romans as Albert II. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son Ladislaus Postumus in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades.\n\nHoly Roman emperors\n\nIn 1440, Frederick III was chosen by the electoral college to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March, 1452, when Pope Nicholas V crowned Frederick III as the Holy Roman Emperor in a grand ceremony held in Rome. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the conciliar movement.\n\nWhile in Rome, Frederick III married Eleanor of Portugal, enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.\n\nAs emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the privilegium maius. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the Albertinian line was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the Tyrolean branch of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the Rhine to the Mur and Leitha.\n\nOn the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), in which he forced Charles the Bold of Burgundy to give his daughter Mary of Burgundy as wife to Frederick's son Maximilian. The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the Low Countries. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children Philip the Handsome. Charles VIII of France contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favour of Philip in the Treaty of Senlis in 1493.Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918. Eine Dynastie im Reich und in Europa. W. Kohlhammer, 2000. \n\nAfter the death of his father in 1493, Maximilian was proclaimed the new King of the Romans, receiving the name Maximilian I. Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.\n\nMaximilian's rule (1493–1519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son Philip the Handsome (also known as Phillip the Fair) married Joanna of Castile, also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of Castile, Aragon, and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became Charles V and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the New World), Southern Italy, Austria, and the Low Countries.Great Events from History, The Renaissance & Early Modern Era, Vol I, p. 112–114, author-Clare Callaghan, .\n\nThe foundations for the later empire of Austria-Hungary were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515, and has been described by some historians as the First Congress of Vienna due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, became the King of Bohemia.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true world power by the time of Charles V, for the first and only time in their history—the \"World Emperor\" ruling an \"empire on which the sun never sets\".\n\nThe Habsburgs' policies against Protestantism led to an eradication of the former in throughout vast areas under their control.\n\nDivision of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs\n\nAfter the assignment, on 21 April 1521, of the Austrian lands to Ferdinand I by his brother Emperor Charles V (also King Charles I of Spain) (1516–1556), the dynasty split into the junior branch of the Austrian Habsburgs and the senior branch of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Austrian Habsburgs held the title of Holy Roman Emperor after Charles' death in 1558, as well as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands and the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nThe senior Spanish branch ruled over Spain, its Italian possessions and its colonial empire, the Netherlands, and, for a time (1580–1640), Portugal. Hungary was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526. For 150 years most of the country was occupied by the Ottoman Turks but these territories were re-conquered in 1683–1699.\n\nIn the secret Oñate treaty, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the War of the Spanish Succession), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the War of the Austrian Succession), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.\n\nExtinction of the Spanish Habsburgs\n\nThe Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of consanguineous marriages. This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their gene pool. Marriages between first cousins, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the University of Santiago de Compostela suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.  The gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line Charles II, who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by genetic disorders, possessed a genome comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father, probably because of \"remote inbreeding\".\n\nExtinction of the Austrian Habsburgs\n\nThe Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Charles VI and in the female line in 1780 with the death of his daughter Maria Theresa; it was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine in the person of her son Joseph II. The new successor house styled itself formally as House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Habsburg-Lothringen), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg. The heiress of the last Austrian Habsburgs Maria Theresa had married Francis Stephan, Duke of LorraineMaria Theresa was originally engaged to Léopold Clément of Lorraine, older brother of Francis Stephan. (both of them were great-grandchildren of Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, but from different empresses). Their descendants carried on the Habsburg tradition from Vienna under the dynastic name Habsburg-Lorraine, although technically a new ruling house came into existence in the Austrian territories, the House of Lorraine (see Dukes of Lorraine family tree). It is thought that extensive intra-family marriages within both lines contributed to their extinctions.\n\nHabsburg-Lorraine\n\nOn 6 August 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved under the French Emperor Napoleon I's reorganization of Germany. However, in anticipation of the loss of his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II declared himself hereditary Emperor of Austria (as Francis I) on 11 August 1804, three months after Napoleon had declared himself Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804.\n\nEmperor Francis I of Austria used the official full list of titles: \"We, Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; King of Jerusalem, Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia and Lodomeria; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Würzburg, Franconia, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; Grand Duke of Cracow; Grand Prince of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Sandomir, Masovia, Lublin, Upper and Lower Silesia, Auschwitz and Zator, Teschen, and Friule; Prince of Berchtesgaden and Mergentheim; Princely Count of Habsburg, Gorizia, and Gradisca and of the Tyrol; and Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and Istria\".\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 created a real union, whereby the Kingdom of Hungary was granted co-equality with the Empire of Austria, that henceforth didn't include the Kingdom of Hungary as a crownland anymore. The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal statusMicrosoft Encarta: The height of the dual monarchy Under this arrangement, the Hungarians referred to their ruler as king and never emperor (see k. u. k.).  This prevailed until the Habsburgs' deposition from both Austria and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.\n\nOn 11 November 1918, with his empire collapsing around him, the last Habsburg ruler, Charles I (who also reigned as Charles IV of Hungary) issued a proclamation recognizing Austria's right to determine the future of the state and renouncing any role in state affairs.  Two days later, he issued a separate proclamation for Hungary.  Even though he did not officially abdicate, this is considered the end of the Habsburg dynasty.  In 1919, the new republican Austrian government subsequently passed a law banishing the Habsburgs from Austrian territory until they renounced all intentions of regaining the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.  Charles made several attempts to regain the throne of Hungary, and in 1921 the Hungarian government passed a law which revoked Charles' rights and dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Habsburgs did not formally abandon all hope of returning to power until Otto von Habsburg, the eldest son of Charles I, renounced all claims to the throne.\n\nThe dynasty's motto was \"Leave the waging of wars to others!  But you, happy Austria, marry; for the realms which Mars awards to others, Venus transfers to you.\"Spielvogel, Jackson J. Western Civilization: Comprehensive Volume. 5th ed. Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2003. 330. Print.\n\nFamily tree\n\nSimilarly, this family tree only includes male scions of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine who survived to adulthood:\n\nMonarchs of the House of Habsburg\n\nThe Habsburg Empire was never composed of a single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.  A complete listing of the arms can be found at the Habsburg Armory.\n\nAncestors\n\n* Guntram the Rich (ca. 930–985 / 990) Father of:\n* Lanzelin of Altenburg (died 991). Besides Radbot, he had sons named Rudolph I, Wernher, and Landolf.\n\nCounts of Habsburg\n\nBefore Rudolph rose to German king, the Habsburgs were Counts in what is today southwestern Germany and Switzerland.\n\n* Radbot of Klettgau, built the Habsburg Castle (ca. 985–1035). Besides Werner I, he had two other sons: Otto I, who would become Count of Sundgau in the Alsace, and Albrecht I.\n* Werner I, Count of Habsburg (1025 / 1030–1096). Besides Otto II, there was another son, Albert II, who was reeve of Muri from 1111–1141 after the death of Otto II.\n* Otto II of Habsburg; first to name himself as \"of Habsburg\" (died 1111) Father of:\n* Werner II of Habsburg (around 1135; died 1167) Father of:\n* Albrecht III of Habsburg (the Rich), died 1199. Under him, the Habsburg territories expanded to cover most of what is today the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Father of:\n* Rudolph II of Habsburg (b. c. 1160, died 1232) Father of:\n* Albrecht IV of Habsburg, (died 1239 / 1240); father of Rudolph IV of Habsburg, who would later become king Rudolph I of Germany. Between Albrecht IV and his brother Rudolph III, the Habsburg properties were split, with Albrecht keeping the Aargau and the western parts, the eastern parts going to Rudolph III. Albrecht IV was also a mutual ancestor of Sophia Chotek and of her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria\n\nDukes/Archdukes of Austria\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, when the Habsburgs expanded their territories in the east, they usually ruled as dukes of the Duchy of Austria which covered only what is today Lower Austria (Niederösterreich) and the eastern part of Upper Austria (Oberösterreich). The Habsburg possessions also included the rest of what was then called Inner Austria (Innerösterreich), i.e. the Duchy of Styria, and then expanded west to include the Duchy of Carinthia and Carniola in 1335 and the Count of Tirol in 1363. Their original scattered possessions in the southern Alsace, south-western Germany and Vorarlberg were collectively known as Further Austria.\n\nThe senior Habsburg dynast generally ruled Lower Austria from Vienna as archduke (\"paramount duke\") of the Duchy of Austria. The Styrian lands had already been ruled in personal union by the Babenberg dukes of Austria since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany upon his victory in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke Albert II of Austria also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent March of Carniola at the hands of Emperor Louis the Bavarian as Imperial fiefs.\n\nThe Habsburg dukes gradually lost their homelands south of the Rhine and Lake Constance to the expanding Old Swiss Confederacy. Unless mentioned explicitly, the dukes of Austria also ruled over Further Austria until 1379, after that year, Further Austria was ruled by the Princely Count of Tyrol. Names in italics designate dukes who never actually ruled.\n\nWhen Albert's son Duke Rudolf IV of Austria died in 1365, his younger brothers Albert III and Leopold III quarrelled about his heritage and in the Treaty of Neuberg of 1379 finally split the Habsburg territories: The Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as \"Lower Austria\" (Niederösterreich), but comprising modern Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria), while the Leopoldian line ruled in the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan territories, subsumed under the denotation of \"Inner Austria\". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called Further Austria; sometimes both were collectively referred to as \"Upper Austria\" (Oberösterreich) in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.\n\nAfter the death of Leopold's eldest son William in 1406, the Leopoldinian line was further split among his brothers into the Inner Austrian territory under Ernest the Iron and a Tyrolean/Further Austrian line under Frederick IV. In 1457 Ernest's son Duke Frederick V of Inner Austria also gained the Austrian archduchy after his Albertine cousin Ladislaus the Posthumous had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines, when Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favour of Frederick's son Maximilian I. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial Austrian Circle.\n\nArchduke of Austria, was invented in the Privilegium Maius, a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Originally, it was meant to denote the \"ruler\" (thus \"Arch-\") of the duchy of Austria, usually from Vienna, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on a par with the Prince-electors, as Austria had been passed as hereditary prince-electors of the empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that title to the highest ranking Imperial princes. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognise the title.\n\nThe archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III. Emperor Frederick III himself used just \"Duke of Austria\", never Archduke, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458.\n\nIn 1477, Frederick III also granted the title archduke to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria.\nFrederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (died 1482), as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled \"Duke of Austria\"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and Philip (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\nArchduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory, i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these \"junior\" archdukes did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, archduke and its female form, archduchess, came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria.\n\n* Rudolph II, son of Rudolph I, duke of Austria and Styria together with his brother 1282–1283, was dispossessed by his brother, who eventually would be murdered by one of Rudolph's sons.\n* Albert I (Albrecht I), son of Rudolph I and brother of the above, duke from 1282–1308; was Holy Roman Emperor from 1298–1308.

Under Maximilian, the possessions of the Habsburgs would be united again under one ruler, after he had re-conquered the Duchy of Austria after the death of Matthias Corvinus, who resided in Vienna and styled himself duke of Austria from 1485–1490.\n\nKing of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperors prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n*Rudolph I, emperor 1273–1291 (never crowned) \n*Albert I, emperor 1298–1308 (never crowned) \n*Albert II, emperor 1438–1439 (never crowned) -ancestor of Empress Catherine II of Russia \n*Frederick III, emperor 1440–1493 \n\nKings of Hungary and Bohemia prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary and Bohemia (1437–1439) \n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, king of Hungary (1444–1457) and Bohemia (1453–1457) \n\nHoly Roman Emperors, Archdukes of Austria\n\nThe title Archduke of Austria, the one most famously associated with the Habsburgs, was invented in the Privilegium Maius, a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Originally, it was meant to denote the ruler of the (thus 'Arch')duchy of Austria, in an effort to put that ruler on par with the Prince-electors, as Austria had been passed over in the Golden Bull of 1356, when the electorships had been assigned. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognize the title. Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, was never in his lifetime authorized to use it, and accordingly, not he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title.\n\nDuke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title \"archduke\".  This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by his son, Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had (permanently) gained control of the office of the Holy Roman Emperor. Emperor Frederick III himself used just Duke of Austria, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nFrederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (died 1482) as the title never appears in documents of joint Maximilian and Mary rule in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled Duke of Austria). The title appears first in documents of joint Maximilian and Philip (his under-age son) rule in the Low Countries. It only gained currency with Charles V and the descendants of his brother, the Emperor Ferdinand.\n\n*Maximilian I, emperor 1508–1519    \n*Charles V, emperor 1519–1556, his arms are explained in an article about them  \n\nTitular Dukes of Burgundy, Lords of the Netherlands \n\nThe reigning duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was the chief political opponent of Maximilian's father Frederick III. Charles controlled not only Burgundy (both dukedom and county), but the wealthy and powerful Southern Netherlands, current Flanders, the real center of his power.  Frederick was concerned about Burgundy's expansive tendencies on the western border of his Holy Roman Empire, and to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles's only daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to his son Maximilian. After the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), he was successful. The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on the evening of 16 August 1477, after the death of Charles.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. . pp. 38–45.  Mary and the Habsburgs lost the Duchy of Burgundy to France, but managed to defend and hold onto the rest what became the 17 provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands.  After Mary's death in 1482, Maximilian acted as regent for his son:\n\n*Philip the Handsome (1482–1506)  \n*Charles V (1506–1555)  \n*Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy, regent (1507–1515) and (1519–1530)   \n*Mary of Hungary, dowager queen of Hungary, sister of Charles V, governor of the Netherlands, 1531–1555  \n*Margaret of Parma, illegitimate daughter of Charles V, Duchess of Parma, and mother of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, governor 1559–1567 \n*Don John of Austria, illegitimate son of Charles V, victor of Lepanto, governor of the Netherlands, 1576–1578 \n*Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, son of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Netherlands, 1578–1592 \n\nThe Netherlands were frequently governed directly by a regent or governor-general, who was a collateral member of the Habsburgs.  By the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 Charles V combined the Netherlands into one administrative unit, to be inherited by his son Philip II.  Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity.  The Habsburgs controlled the 17 Provinces of the Netherlands until the Dutch Revolt in the second half of the 16th century, when they lost the seven northern Protestant provinces.  They held onto the southern Catholic part (roughly modern Belgium and Luxembourg) as the Spanish and Austrian Netherlands until they were conquered by French Revolutionary armies in 1795.  The one exception to this was the period of (1601–1621), when shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he renounced his rights to the Netherlands in favor of his daughter Isabella and her fiancé, Archduke Albert of Austria, a younger son of Emperor Maximilian II.  The territories reverted to Spain on the death of Albert in 1621, as the couple had no surviving offspring, and Isabella acted as regent-governor until her death in 1633:\n\n*the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, 1601-1621  \n\nKing of England\n\n*Philip II of Spain (Jure uxoris King, with Mary I of England 1554–1558)\n\nSpanish Habsburgs: Kings of Spain, Kings of Portugal (1581–1640) \n\nThe Habsburg Kingdom(s) of Spain were more a personal union of possessions of the Habsburg king and dynast, who was King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Valencia, sometime of Portugal, Naples and Sicily, Duke of Milan, and Lord of the Americas, as well as Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders and Holland, Duke of Luxemburg (i.e. all the Habsburg Netherlands). A listing of a number of the titles can be seen here.  The dynast (head of the Spanish Habsburgs, i.e. the King, showed this wide range of claims in his arms.  There are many more variants of these arms in the Habsburg Armory, Spanish Section as well as coat of arms of the King of Spain, coat of arms of Spain, coat of arms of the Prince of Asturias, and coats of arms of Spanish Monarchs in Italy.  The Spanish Habsburgs also kept up the Burgundian court tradition of the dynast being known by a \"nickname\" (e.g. the Bold, the Prudent, the Bewitched).List of nicknames of European royalty and nobility: C  In Spain they were known as the \"\"Casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were known as \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).\n\n*Philip I of Castile the Handsome, second son of Maximilian I, founded the Spanish Habsburgs in 1496 by marrying Joanna the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella.

The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. The Inner Austrian line founded by Archduke Charles II prevailed again, when his son and successor as regent of Inner Austria (i.e. the Duchy of Styria, the Duchy of Carniola with March of Istria, the Duchy of Carinthia, the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, and the Imperial City of Trieste, ruled from Graz) Ferdinand II in 1619 became Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor as well as King of Bohemia and Hungary in 1620. The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand's brother Archduke Leopold V survived until the death of his son Sigismund Francis in 1665, whereafter their territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands.

As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627. By their acquisition of the Bohemian Crown in 1526 the Habsburgs secured the highest rank among the secular prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nMain line\n\n* Rudolph I, king of Bohemia 1306–1307\n\nAlbertine line: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Albert, king of Bohemia 1437–1439\n* Ladislaus Posthumus, king of Bohemia 1453–1457\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Ferdinand I, king of Bohemia 1526–1564\n* Maximilian I, king of Bohemia 1563–1576\n* Rudolph II, king of Bohemia 1572–1611\n* Matthias, king of Bohemia 1611–1618\n* Ferdinand II, king of Bohemia 1621–1637\n* Ferdinand III, king of Bohemia 1625–1657\n* Ferdinand IV, king of Bohemia 1647–1654\n* Leopold I, king of Bohemia 1655–1705\n* Joseph I, king of Bohemia 1687–1711\n* Charles VI, king of Bohemia 1711–1740\n* Maria Theresa, queen of Bohemia 1743–1780\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine, main line: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Joseph II, king of Bohemia 1780–1790\n* Leopold II, king of Bohemia 1790–1792\n* Francis, king of Bohemia 1792–1835\n* Ferdinand V, king of Bohemia 1835–1848\n* Francis Joseph I, king of Bohemia 1848–1916\n* Charles III, king of Bohemia 1916–1918\n\nFamily name Habsburg \n\nMost royal families did not have a family name until the 19th century. They were known as \"of\" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as \"of France\" (see Wikipedia on House of Bourbon).  The name \"Capet\" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  \"Bourbon\" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as \"of England\", or later \"Great Britain\" (see House of Windsor) or \"of\" the main title associated with their parent (see Prince William of Wales). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see John of Gaunt, Henry Bolingbroke, or Henry of Monmouth). Even when the royal family had a last name (see House of Tudor, House of Stuart or House of Windsor), it was not used in their titles.\n\nSimilarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in \"Princely Count of Habsburg\" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the \"house of Austria\".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke xyz \"of Austria\" and had no need of a surname. Charles V was known in his youth after his birthplace as \"Charles of Ghent\".  When he became king of the Spains he was known as \"Charles of Spain\", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V (\"Charles Quint\").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the \"casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were given the title of \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).\n\nWhen Maria Theresa married the duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen (see above), there was a desire to show that the ruling dynasty continued as did all its inherited rights, as the ruling dynasty's right to rule was based on inherited legitimate birthright in each of the constituent territories.  Using the concept of \"Habsburg\" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the \"Germaness\" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in \"Germany\".  As Emperor Francis Joseph wrote to Napoleon III „Nein, ich bin ein deutscher Fürst“ 1: Wolfgang Menzel: Die letzten 120 Jahre der Weltgeschichte, Band 6 (1740-1860), Adolph Krabbe, Stuttgart 1860, S. 211 2.: Wolfgang Menzel: Supplementband zu der Geschichte der letzten 40 Jahre (1816-1856).

Princes and members of the house use the Tripartite arms shown above, generally forgoing any imperial pretentions.\n\nArms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\nThe arms of dominion began to take on a life of their own in the 19th century as the idea of the state as independent from the Habsburg dynasty took root.  They are the national arms as borne by a sovereign in his capacity as head of state and represent the state as separate from the person of the monarch or his dynasty.  That very idea had been, heretofore, foreign to the concept of the Habsburg state.  The state had been the personal property of the Habsburg dynast.  Since the states, territories, and nationalities represented were in many cases only united to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord, these full (\"grand\") arms of dominion of Austria-Hungary reflect the complex political infrastructure that was necessarily to accommodate the many different nationalities and groupings within the empire after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\nAfter 1867 the eastern part of the empire, also called Transleithania, was mostly under the domination of the Kingdom of Hungary.  The shield integrated the arms of the kingdom of Hungary, with two angels and supporters and the crown of St. Stephen, along with the territories that were subject to it:\n\nThe Kingdom of Dalmatia, the Kingdom of Croatia, the Kingdom of Slavonia (conjoined with Croatia as the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia - formally known as the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, although the claim to Dalmatia was mostly de jure), the Great Principality of Transylvania, the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1915–1918), the City of Fiume and its district (modern Rijeka), and in the center, the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe western or Austrian part of the empire, Cisleithania, continued using the shield of the Empire in 1815 but with the seals of various member territories located around the central shield. Paradoxically, some of these coats of arms belonged to the territories that were part of the Hungarian part of the empire and shield. This shield, the most frequently used until 1915, was known as the middle shield. There was also the small shield, with just the personal arms of the Habsburgs, as used in 1815.\n\nVersion of 1915\n\nIn 1915, in the middle of World War I, Austria-Hungary adopted a heraldic composition uniting the shield that was used in the Hungarian part, also known as the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen, with a new version of the medium shield of the Austrian part as depicted above in the section on the main line of the Emperors of Austria.\n\nBefore 1915, the arms of the different territories of the Austrian part of the Empire (heraldry was added to some areas not shown in the previous version and to the left to the Hungarian part) appeared together in the shield positioned on the double-headed eagle coat of arms of the Austrian Empire as an inescutcheon. The eagle was inside a shield with a gold field. The latter shield was supported by two griffins and was topped by the Austrian Imperial Crown (previously these items were included only in the large shield). Then, shown in the center of both arms of dominion, as an inescutcheon to the inescutcheon, is the small shield, i.e. personal arms, of the Habsburgs. All this was surrounded by the collar Order of the Golden FleeceH. Ströhl: Die neuen österreichischen, ungarischen und gemeinsamen Wappen. Hrsg. auf Grund der mit d. allerhöchsten Handschreiben vom 10. u. 11. Okt. 1915, bezw. 2. u. 5. März 1916 erfolgten Einführung. Viena 1917.\n\nIn the heraldic composition of 1915, the shields of the two foci of the empire, Austria and Hungary, were brought together. The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, below which was the Military Order of Maria Theresa, below which was the collars of the Orders of St. Stephen's and Leopold. At the bottom was the motto that read \"AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER\" (\"indivisible and inseparable\"). There were other simplified versions which did not have the supports depicted, and the simple shields of Austria and Hungary.  These were the arms of the Empire of Austria with an inescutcheon of Austria, and the Arms of Hungary (with chequer of Croatia at the tip).\n\nGallery",

The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Kingdom of Illyria, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Kingdom of Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the 16th century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nThe House takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland, in the canton of Aargau, by Count Radbot of Klettgau, who chose to name his fortress Habsburg. His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding \"Count of Habsburg\" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.\n\nBy 1276, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg had moved the family's power base from Habsburg Castle to the Duchy of Austria. Rudolph had become King of Germany in 1273, and the dynasty of the House of Habsburg was truly entrenched in 1276 when Rudolph became ruler of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.\n\nA series of dynastic marriagesPaula Sutter Fichtner, \"Dynastic Marriage in Sixteenth-Century Habsburg Diplomacy and Statecraft: An Interdisciplinary Approach,\" American Historical Review Vol. 81, No. 2 (April 1976), pp. 243-265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1851170 in JSTOR] enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy, Spain and its colonial empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and other territories. In the 16th century, the family separated into the senior Habsburg Spain and the junior Habsburg Monarchy branches, who settled their mutual claims in the Oñate treaty.\n\nThe House of Habsburg became extinct in the 18th century. The senior Spanish branch ended upon the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and was replaced by the House of Bourbon. The remaining Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and completely in 1780 with the death of his eldest daughter Maria Theresa of Austria. It was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine. The new successor house styled itself formally as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Habsburg-Lothringen), and because it was often confusingly still referred to as the House of Habsburg, historians use the unofficial appellation of the Habsburg Monarchy for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the junior Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918.\n\nPrincipal roles\n\nTheir principal roles (including the roles of their cadet branches) were as follows:\n* Holy Roman Emperors (intermittently from 1273 until 1806), kings of Germany,The Kingdom of Germany was within the\nHoly Roman Empire from 962 until 1806. and kings of the RomansKing of the Romans\"\n was, from the time of Emperor Henry II (1014–1024), the title used by the German king following his election by the princes. The title King of the Romans became functionally obsolete after 1508.)\n* Rulers of Austria (as dukes from 1278 until 1453; as archdukes from 1453 until 1806/1918; as emperors from 1804 until 1918)\n* Kings of Bohemia (1306–1307, 1437–1439, 1453–1457, 1526–1918)\n* Kings of Hungary and Croatia (1526–1918)\n* Kings of Spain (1516–1700)\n* Kings of Portugal (1581–1640)\n* Kings of Galicia and Lodomeria (1772–1918)\n* Grand princes of Transylvania (1690–1867)\n\nNumerous other titles were attached to the crowns listed above.\n\nHistory\n\nCounts of Habsburg\n\nThe progenitor of the House of Habsburg may have been Guntram the Rich, a count in the Breisgau who lived in the 10th century, and forewith farther back as the early medieval Adalrich, Duke of Alsace, father of the Etichonids from which Habsburg derives. His grandson Radbot, Count of Habsburg founded the Habsburg Castle, after which the Habsburgs are named. The origins of the castle's name, located in what is now the Swiss canton of Aargau, are uncertain. There is disagreement on whether the name is derived from the High German Habichtsburg (hawk castle), or from the Middle High German word hab/hap meaning ford, as there is a river with a ford nearby. The first documented use of the name by the dynasty itself has been traced to the year 1108.\"Habsburger-Gedenkjahr im Aargau\", Neue Zürcher Zeitung, (page 17) 23 May 2008.[http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html art-tv.ch]\nThe Habsburg Castle was the family seat in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Habsburgs expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges, especially countship rights in Zürichgau, Aargau and Thurgau. In the 13th century, the house aimed its marriage policy at families in Upper Alsace and Swabia. They were also able to gain high positions in the church hierarchy for their members. Territorially, they often profited from the extinction of other noble families such as the House of Kyburg.\n\nKings of the Romans\n\nBy the second half of the 13th century, count Rudolph IV (1218–1291) had become one of the most influential territorial lords in the area between the Vosges Mountains and Lake Constance. Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October, 1273, Rudolph was chosen as the King of the Romans and received the name Rudolph I of Germany.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. .\n\nIn 1282, the Habsburgs gained the rulership of the Duchy of Austria, which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. Through the forged privilegium maius document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the house and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1339–1365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's descendants ignored the rule, leading to the separation of the Albertian and Leopoldian family lines in 1379.\n\nBy marrying Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1437, Duke Albert V (1397–1439) became the ruler of Bohemia and Hungary, expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the King of the Romans as Albert II. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son Ladislaus Postumus in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades.\n\nHoly Roman emperors\n\nIn 1440, Frederick III was chosen by the electoral college to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March, 1452, when Pope Nicholas V crowned Frederick III as the Holy Roman Emperor in a grand ceremony held in Rome. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the conciliar movement.\n\nWhile in Rome, Frederick III married Eleanor of Portugal, enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.\n\nAs emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the privilegium maius. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the Albertinian line was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the Tyrolean branch of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the Rhine to the Mur and Leitha.\n\nOn the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), in which he forced Charles the Bold of Burgundy to give his daughter Mary of Burgundy as wife to Frederick's son Maximilian. The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the Low Countries. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children Philip the Handsome. Charles VIII of France contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favour of Philip in the Treaty of Senlis in 1493.Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918. Eine Dynastie im Reich und in Europa. W. Kohlhammer, 2000. \n\nAfter the death of his father in 1493, Maximilian was proclaimed the new King of the Romans, receiving the name Maximilian I. Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.\n\nMaximilian's rule (1493–1519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son Philip the Handsome (also known as Phillip the Fair) married Joanna of Castile, also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of Castile, Aragon, and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became Charles V and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the New World), Southern Italy, Austria, and the Low Countries.Great Events from History, The Renaissance & Early Modern Era, Vol I, p. 112–114, author-Clare Callaghan, .\n\nThe foundations for the later empire of Austria-Hungary were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515, and has been described by some historians as the First Congress of Vienna due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, became the King of Bohemia.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true world power by the time of Charles V, for the first and only time in their history—the \"World Emperor\" ruling an \"empire on which the sun never sets\".\n\nThe Habsburgs' policies against Protestantism led to an eradication of the former in throughout vast areas under their control.\n\nDivision of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs\n\nAfter the assignment, on 21 April 1521, of the Austrian lands to Ferdinand I by his brother Emperor Charles V (also King Charles I of Spain) (1516–1556), the dynasty split into the junior branch of the Austrian Habsburgs and the senior branch of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Austrian Habsburgs held the title of Holy Roman Emperor after Charles' death in 1558, as well as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands and the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nThe senior Spanish branch ruled over Spain, its Italian possessions and its colonial empire, the Netherlands, and, for a time (1580–1640), Portugal. Hungary was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526. For 150 years most of the country was occupied by the Ottoman Turks but these territories were re-conquered in 1683–1699.\n\nIn the secret Oñate treaty, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the War of the Spanish Succession), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the War of the Austrian Succession), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.\n\nExtinction of the Spanish Habsburgs\n\nThe Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of consanguineous marriages. This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their gene pool. Marriages between first cousins, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the University of Santiago de Compostela suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.  The gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line Charles II, who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by genetic disorders, possessed a genome comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father, probably because of \"remote inbreeding\".\n\nExtinction of the Austrian Habsburgs\n\nThe Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Charles VI and in the female line in 1780 with the death of his daughter Maria Theresa; it was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine in the person of her son Joseph II. The new successor house styled itself formally as House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Habsburg-Lothringen), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg. The heiress of the last Austrian Habsburgs Maria Theresa had married Francis Stephan, Duke of LorraineMaria Theresa was originally engaged to Léopold Clément of Lorraine, older brother of Francis Stephan. (both of them were great-grandchildren of Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, but from different empresses). Their descendants carried on the Habsburg tradition from Vienna under the dynastic name Habsburg-Lorraine, although technically a new ruling house came into existence in the Austrian territories, the House of Lorraine (see Dukes of Lorraine family tree). It is thought that extensive intra-family marriages within both lines contributed to their extinctions.\n\nHabsburg-Lorraine\n\nOn 6 August 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved under the French Emperor Napoleon I's reorganization of Germany. However, in anticipation of the loss of his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II declared himself hereditary Emperor of Austria (as Francis I) on 11 August 1804, three months after Napoleon had declared himself Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804.\n\nEmperor Francis I of Austria used the official full list of titles: \"We, Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; King of Jerusalem, Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia and Lodomeria; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Würzburg, Franconia, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; Grand Duke of Cracow; Grand Prince of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Sandomir, Masovia, Lublin, Upper and Lower Silesia, Auschwitz and Zator, Teschen, and Friule; Prince of Berchtesgaden and Mergentheim; Princely Count of Habsburg, Gorizia, and Gradisca and of the Tyrol; and Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and Istria\".\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 created a real union, whereby the Kingdom of Hungary was granted co-equality with the Empire of Austria, that henceforth didn't include the Kingdom of Hungary as a crownland anymore. The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal statusMicrosoft Encarta: The height of the dual monarchy Under this arrangement, the Hungarians referred to their ruler as king and never emperor (see k. u. k.).  This prevailed until the Habsburgs' deposition from both Austria and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.\n\nOn 11 November 1918, with his empire collapsing around him, the last Habsburg ruler, Charles I (who also reigned as Charles IV of Hungary) issued a proclamation recognizing Austria's right to determine the future of the state and renouncing any role in state affairs.  Two days later, he issued a separate proclamation for Hungary.  Even though he did not officially abdicate, this is considered the end of the Habsburg dynasty.  In 1919, the new republican Austrian government subsequently passed a law banishing the Habsburgs from Austrian territory until they renounced all intentions of regaining the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.  Charles made several attempts to regain the throne of Hungary, and in 1921 the Hungarian government passed a law which revoked Charles' rights and dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Habsburgs did not formally abandon all hope of returning to power until Otto von Habsburg, the eldest son of Charles I, renounced all claims to the throne.\n\nThe dynasty's motto was \"Leave the waging of wars to others!  But you, happy Austria, marry; for the realms which Mars awards to others, Venus transfers to you.\"Spielvogel, Jackson J. Western Civilization: Comprehensive Volume. 5th ed. Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2003. 330. Print.\n\nFamily tree\n\nSimilarly, this family tree only includes male scions of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine who survived to adulthood:\n\nMonarchs of the House of Habsburg\n\nThe Habsburg Empire was never composed of a single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.  A complete listing of the arms can be found at the Habsburg Armory.\n\nAncestors\n\n* Guntram the Rich (ca. 930–985 / 990) Father of:\n* Lanzelin of Altenburg (died 991). Besides Radbot, he had sons named Rudolph I, Wernher, and Landolf.\n\nCounts of Habsburg\n\nBefore Rudolph rose to German king, the Habsburgs were Counts in what is today southwestern Germany and Switzerland.\n\n* Radbot of Klettgau, built the Habsburg Castle (ca. 985–1035). Besides Werner I, he had two other sons: Otto I, who would become Count of Sundgau in the Alsace, and Albrecht I.\n* Werner I, Count of Habsburg (1025 / 1030–1096). Besides Otto II, there was another son, Albert II, who was reeve of Muri from 1111–1141 after the death of Otto II.\n* Otto II of Habsburg; first to name himself as \"of Habsburg\" (died 1111) Father of:\n* Werner II of Habsburg (around 1135; died 1167) Father of:\n* Albrecht III of Habsburg (the Rich), died 1199. Under him, the Habsburg territories expanded to cover most of what is today the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Father of:\n* Rudolph II of Habsburg (b. c. 1160, died 1232) Father of:\n* Albrecht IV of Habsburg, (died 1239 / 1240); father of Rudolph IV of Habsburg, who would later become king Rudolph I of Germany. Between Albrecht IV and his brother Rudolph III, the Habsburg properties were split, with Albrecht keeping the Aargau and the western parts, the eastern parts going to Rudolph III. Albrecht IV was also a mutual ancestor of Sophia Chotek and of her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria\n\nDukes/Archdukes of Austria\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, when the Habsburgs expanded their territories in the east, they usually ruled as dukes of the Duchy of Austria which covered only what is today Lower Austria (Niederösterreich) and the eastern part of Upper Austria (Oberösterreich). The Habsburg possessions also included the rest of what was then called Inner Austria (Innerösterreich), i.e. the Duchy of Styria, and then expanded west to include the Duchy of Carinthia and Carniola in 1335 and the Count of Tirol in 1363. Their original scattered possessions in the southern Alsace, south-western Germany and Vorarlberg were collectively known as Further Austria.\n\nThe senior Habsburg dynast generally ruled Lower Austria from Vienna as archduke (\"paramount duke\") of the Duchy of Austria. The Styrian lands had already been ruled in personal union by the Babenberg dukes of Austria since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany upon his victory in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke Albert II of Austria also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent March of Carniola at the hands of Emperor Louis the Bavarian as Imperial fiefs.\n\nThe Habsburg dukes gradually lost their homelands south of the Rhine and Lake Constance to the expanding Old Swiss Confederacy. Unless mentioned explicitly, the dukes of Austria also ruled over Further Austria until 1379, after that year, Further Austria was ruled by the Princely Count of Tyrol. Names in italics designate dukes who never actually ruled.\n\nWhen Albert's son Duke Rudolf IV of Austria died in 1365, his younger brothers Albert III and Leopold III quarrelled about his heritage and in the Treaty of Neuberg of 1379 finally split the Habsburg territories: The Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as \"Lower Austria\" (Niederösterreich), but comprising modern Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria), while the Leopoldian line ruled in the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan territories, subsumed under the denotation of \"Inner Austria\". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called Further Austria; sometimes both were collectively referred to as \"Upper Austria\" (Oberösterreich) in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.\n\nAfter the death of Leopold's eldest son William in 1406, the Leopoldinian line was further split among his brothers into the Inner Austrian territory under Ernest the Iron and a Tyrolean/Further Austrian line under Frederick IV. In 1457 Ernest's son Duke Frederick V of Inner Austria also gained the Austrian archduchy after his Albertine cousin Ladislaus the Posthumous had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines, when Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favour of Frederick's son Maximilian I. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial Austrian Circle.\n\nArchduke of Austria, was invented in the Privilegium Maius, a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Originally, it was meant to denote the \"ruler\" (thus \"Arch-\") of the duchy of Austria, usually from Vienna, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on a par with the Prince-electors, as Austria had been passed as hereditary prince-electors of the empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that title to the highest ranking Imperial princes. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognise the title.\n\nThe archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III. Emperor Frederick III himself used just \"Duke of Austria\", never Archduke, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458.\n\nIn 1477, Frederick III also granted the title archduke to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria.\nFrederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (died 1482), as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled \"Duke of Austria\"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and Philip (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\nArchduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory, i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these \"junior\" archdukes did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, archduke and its female form, archduchess, came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria.\n\n* Rudolph II, son of Rudolph I, duke of Austria and Styria together with his brother 1282–1283, was dispossessed by his brother, who eventually would be murdered by one of Rudolph's sons.\n* Albert I (Albrecht I), son of Rudolph I and brother of the above, duke from 1282–1308; was Holy Roman Emperor from 1298–1308.

Under Maximilian, the possessions of the Habsburgs would be united again under one ruler, after he had re-conquered the Duchy of Austria after the death of Matthias Corvinus, who resided in Vienna and styled himself duke of Austria from 1485–1490.\n\nKing of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperors prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n*Rudolph I, emperor 1273–1291 (never crowned) \n*Albert I, emperor 1298–1308 (never crowned) \n*Albert II, emperor 1438–1439 (never crowned) -ancestor of Empress Catherine II of Russia \n*Frederick III, emperor 1440–1493 \n\nKings of Hungary and Bohemia prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary and Bohemia (1437–1439) \n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, king of Hungary (1444–1457) and Bohemia (1453–1457) \n\nHoly Roman Emperors, Archdukes of Austria\n\nThe title Archduke of Austria, the one most famously associated with the Habsburgs, was invented in the Privilegium Maius, a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Originally, it was meant to denote the ruler of the (thus 'Arch')duchy of Austria, in an effort to put that ruler on par with the Prince-electors, as Austria had been passed over in the Golden Bull of 1356, when the electorships had been assigned. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognize the title. Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, was never in his lifetime authorized to use it, and accordingly, not he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title.\n\nDuke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title \"archduke\".  This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by his son, Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had (permanently) gained control of the office of the Holy Roman Emperor. Emperor Frederick III himself used just Duke of Austria, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nFrederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (died 1482) as the title never appears in documents of joint Maximilian and Mary rule in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled Duke of Austria). The title appears first in documents of joint Maximilian and Philip (his under-age son) rule in the Low Countries. It only gained currency with Charles V and the descendants of his brother, the Emperor Ferdinand.\n\n*Maximilian I, emperor 1508–1519    \n*Charles V, emperor 1519–1556, his arms are explained in an article about them  \n\nTitular Dukes of Burgundy, Lords of the Netherlands \n\nThe reigning duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was the chief political opponent of Maximilian's father Frederick III. Charles controlled not only Burgundy (both dukedom and county), but the wealthy and powerful Southern Netherlands, current Flanders, the real center of his power.  Frederick was concerned about Burgundy's expansive tendencies on the western border of his Holy Roman Empire, and to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles's only daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to his son Maximilian. After the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), he was successful. The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on the evening of 16 August 1477, after the death of Charles.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. . pp. 38–45.

By the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 Charles V combined the Netherlands into one administrative unit, to be inherited by his son Philip II.  Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity.  The Habsburgs controlled the 17 Provinces of the Netherlands until the Dutch Revolt in the second half of the 16th century, when they lost the seven northern Protestant provinces.  They held onto the southern Catholic part (roughly modern Belgium and Luxembourg) as the Spanish and Austrian Netherlands until they were conquered by French Revolutionary armies in 1795.  The one exception to this was the period of (1601–1621), when shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he renounced his rights to the Netherlands in favor of his daughter Isabella and her fiancé, Archduke Albert of Austria, a younger son of Emperor Maximilian II.  The territories reverted to Spain on the death of Albert in 1621, as the couple had no surviving offspring, and Isabella acted as regent-governor until her death in 1633:\n\n*the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, 1601-1621  \n\nKing of England\n\n*Philip II of Spain (Jure uxoris King, with Mary I of England 1554–1558)\n\nSpanish Habsburgs: Kings of Spain, Kings of Portugal (1581–1640) \n\nThe Habsburg Kingdom(s) of Spain were more a personal union of possessions of the Habsburg king and dynast, who was King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Valencia, sometime of Portugal, Naples and Sicily, Duke of Milan, and Lord of the Americas, as well as Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders and Holland, Duke of Luxemburg (i.e. all the Habsburg Netherlands). A listing of a number of the titles can be seen here.  The dynast (head of the Spanish Habsburgs, i.e. the King, showed this wide range of claims in his arms.  There are many more variants of these arms in the Habsburg Armory, Spanish Section as well as coat of arms of the King of Spain, coat of arms of Spain, coat of arms of the Prince of Asturias, and coats of arms of Spanish Monarchs in Italy.  The Spanish Habsburgs also kept up the Burgundian court tradition of the dynast being known by a \"nickname\" (e.g. the Bold, the Prudent, the Bewitched).List of nicknames of European royalty and nobility: C  In Spain they were known as the \"\"Casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were known as \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).\n\n*Philip I of Castile the Handsome, second son of Maximilian I, founded the Spanish Habsburgs in 1496 by marrying Joanna the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Philip died in 1506, leaving the thrones of Castile and Aragon to be inherited and united into the throne of Spain by his son: \n*Charles I 1516–1556, aka Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; divided the House into Austrian and Spanish lines The meanings of his arms are analyzed here.  \n*Philip II the Prudent 1556–1598, also Philip I of Portugal 1581–1598 and Philip I of England with his wife Mary I of England 1554–1558.

The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. The Inner Austrian line founded by Archduke Charles II prevailed again, when his son and successor as regent of Inner Austria (i.e. the Duchy of Styria, the Duchy of Carniola with March of Istria, the Duchy of Carinthia, the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, and the Imperial City of Trieste, ruled from Graz) Ferdinand II in 1619 became Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor as well as King of Bohemia and Hungary in 1620. The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand's brother Archduke Leopold V survived until the death of his son Sigismund Francis in 1665, whereafter their territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands.

Therefore, the kings of Hungary are listed separately.\n\nAlbertine line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary 1437–1439\n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, King of Hungary 1444–1457\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Ferdinand I, king of Hungary 1526–1564\n* Maximilian I, king of Hungary 1563–1576\n* Rudolf I, king of Hungary 1572–1608\n* Matthias II, king of Hungary 1608–1619\n* Ferdinand II, king of Hungary 1618–1637\n* Ferdinand III, king of Hungary 1625–1657\n* Ferdinand IV, king of Hungary 1647–1654\n* Leopold I, king of Hungary 1655–1705\n* Joseph I, king of Hungary 1687–1711\n* Charles III, king of Hungary 1711–1740\n* Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary 1741–1780\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine, main line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Joseph II, king of Hungary 1780–1790\n* Leopold II, king of Hungary 1790–1792\n* Francis, king of Hungary 1792–1835\n* Ferdinand V, king of Hungary and Bohemia 1835–1848\n* Francis Joseph I, king of Hungary 1867–1916\n* Charles IV, king of Hungary 1916–1918\n\nKings of Bohemia \n\nThe kingship of Bohemia was from 1306 a position elected by its nobles. As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627. By their acquisition of the Bohemian Crown in 1526 the Habsburgs secured the highest rank among the secular prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nMain line\n\n* Rudolph I, king of Bohemia 1306–1307\n\nAlbertine line: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Albert, king of Bohemia 1437–1439\n* Ladislaus Posthumus, king of Bohemia 1453–1457\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Ferdinand I, king of Bohemia 1526–1564\n* Maximilian I, king of Bohemia 1563–1576\n* Rudolph II, king of Bohemia 1572–1611\n* Matthias, king of Bohemia 1611–1618\n* Ferdinand II, king of Bohemia 1621–1637\n* Ferdinand III, king of Bohemia 1625–1657\n* Ferdinand IV, king of Bohemia 1647–1654\n* Leopold I, king of Bohemia 1655–1705\n* Joseph I, king of Bohemia 1687–1711\n* Charles VI, king of Bohemia 1711–1740\n* Maria Theresa, queen of Bohemia 1743–1780\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine, main line: Kings of Bohemia\n\n* Joseph II, king of Bohemia 1780–1790\n* Leopold II, king of Bohemia 1790–1792\n* Francis, king of Bohemia 1792–1835\n* Ferdinand V, king of Bohemia 1835–1848\n* Francis Joseph I, king of Bohemia 1848–1916\n* Charles III, king of Bohemia 1916–1918\n\nFamily name Habsburg \n\nMost royal families did not have a family name until the 19th century. They were known as \"of\" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as \"of France\" (see Wikipedia on House of Bourbon).  The name \"Capet\" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  \"Bourbon\" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as \"of England\", or later \"Great Britain\" (see House of Windsor) or \"of\" the main title associated with their parent (see Prince William of Wales). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see John of Gaunt, Henry Bolingbroke, or Henry of Monmouth). Even when the royal family had a last name (see House of Tudor, House of Stuart or House of Windsor), it was not used in their titles.\n\nSimilarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in \"Princely Count of Habsburg\" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the \"house of Austria\".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke xyz \"of Austria\" and had no need of a surname. Charles V was known in his youth after his birthplace as \"Charles of Ghent\".  When he became king of the Spains he was known as \"Charles of Spain\", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V (\"Charles Quint\").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the \"casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were given the title of \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).\n\nWhen Maria Theresa married the duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen (see above), there was a desire to show that the ruling dynasty continued as did all its inherited rights, as the ruling dynasty's right to rule was based on inherited legitimate birthright in each of the constituent territories.  Using the concept of \"Habsburg\" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the \"Germaness\" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in \"Germany\".  As Emperor Francis Joseph wrote to Napoleon III „Nein, ich bin ein deutscher Fürst“ 1: Wolfgang Menzel: Die letzten 120 Jahre der Weltgeschichte, Band 6 (1740-1860), Adolph Krabbe, Stuttgart 1860, S. 211 2.: Wolfgang Menzel: Supplementband zu der Geschichte der letzten 40 Jahre (1816-1856).

Princes and members of the house use the Tripartite arms shown above, generally forgoing any imperial pretentions.\n\nArms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\nThe arms of dominion began to take on a life of their own in the 19th century as the idea of the state as independent from the Habsburg dynasty took root.  They are the national arms as borne by a sovereign in his capacity as head of state and represent the state as separate from the person of the monarch or his dynasty.  That very idea had been, heretofore, foreign to the concept of the Habsburg state.  The state had been the personal property of the Habsburg dynast.  Since the states, territories, and nationalities represented were in many cases only united to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord, these full (\"grand\") arms of dominion of Austria-Hungary reflect the complex political infrastructure that was necessarily to accommodate the many different nationalities and groupings within the empire after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\nAfter 1867 the eastern part of the empire, also called Transleithania, was mostly under the domination of the Kingdom of Hungary.  The shield integrated the arms of the kingdom of Hungary, with two angels and supporters and the crown of St. Stephen, along with the territories that were subject to it:\n\nThe Kingdom of Dalmatia, the Kingdom of Croatia, the Kingdom of Slavonia (conjoined with Croatia as the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia - formally known as the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, although the claim to Dalmatia was mostly de jure), the Great Principality of Transylvania, the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1915–1918), the City of Fiume and its district (modern Rijeka), and in the center, the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe western or Austrian part of the empire, Cisleithania, continued using the shield of the Empire in 1815 but with the seals of various member territories located around the central shield. Paradoxically, some of these coats of arms belonged to the territories that were part of the Hungarian part of the empire and shield. This shield, the most frequently used until 1915, was known as the middle shield. There was also the small shield, with just the personal arms of the Habsburgs, as used in 1815.\n\nVersion of 1915\n\nIn 1915, in the middle of World War I, Austria-Hungary adopted a heraldic composition uniting the shield that was used in the Hungarian part, also known as the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen, with a new version of the medium shield of the Austrian part as depicted above in the section on the main line of the Emperors of Austria.\n\nBefore 1915, the arms of the different territories of the Austrian part of the Empire (heraldry was added to some areas not shown in the previous version and to the left to the Hungarian part) appeared together in the shield positioned on the double-headed eagle coat of arms of the Austrian Empire as an inescutcheon. The eagle was inside a shield with a gold field. The latter shield was supported by two griffins and was topped by the Austrian Imperial Crown (previously these items were included only in the large shield). Then, shown in the center of both arms of dominion, as an inescutcheon to the inescutcheon, is the small shield, i.e. personal arms, of the Habsburgs. All this was surrounded by the collar Order of the Golden FleeceH. Ströhl: Die neuen österreichischen, ungarischen und gemeinsamen Wappen. Hrsg. auf Grund der mit d. allerhöchsten Handschreiben vom 10. u. 11. Okt. 1915, bezw. 2. u. 5. März 1916 erfolgten Einführung. Viena 1917.\n\nIn the heraldic composition of 1915, the shields of the two foci of the empire, Austria and Hungary, were brought together. The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, below which was the Military Order of Maria Theresa, below which was the collars of the Orders of St. Stephen's and Leopold. At the bottom was the motto that read \"AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER\" (\"indivisible and inseparable\"). There were other simplified versions which did not have the supports depicted, and the simple shields of Austria and Hungary.  These were the arms of the Empire of Austria with an inescutcheon of Austria, and the Arms of Hungary (with chequer of Croatia at the tip).\n\nGallery.
