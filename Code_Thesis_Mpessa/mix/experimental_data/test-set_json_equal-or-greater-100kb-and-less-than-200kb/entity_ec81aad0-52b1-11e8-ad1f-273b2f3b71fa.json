  "textBody" : "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito was a British twin-engine shoulder-winged multi-role combat aircraft. The crew of two, pilot and navigator, sat side by side. It served during and after the Second World War. It was one of few operational front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed The Wooden Wonder.Price 2009, p. 3. The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the \"Mossie\" to its crews.Hanson, Dave. [http://www.warbirdalley.com/mossie.htm \"deHavilland DH 98 Mosquito.\"] warbirdalley.com. Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to roles including low to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, neutral countries, through enemy-controlled airspace.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 338. A single passenger could ride in the aircraft's bomb bay when it was adapted for the purpose.\n\nWhen Mosquito production began in 1941 it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.Bowman 2005, p. 21. Entering service in late 1941, the first Mosquito variant was an unarmed high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Subsequent versions continued in this role throughout the war. The first Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064, entered service with No. 105 Squadron on 15 November 1941. From mid-1942 to mid-1943, Mosquito bombers flew high-speed, medium or low-altitude daylight missions against factories, railways and other pinpoint targets in Germany and German-occupied Europe. From June 1943, Mosquito bombers were formed into the Light Night Strike Force and used as pathfinders for RAF Bomber Command heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as \"nuisance\" bombers, often dropping Blockbuster bombs – 4,000 lb (1,812 kg) \"cookies\" – in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.\n\nAs a night fighter from mid-1942, the Mosquito intercepted Luftwaffe raids on Britain, notably those of Operation Steinbock in 1944. Starting in July 1942, Mosquito night-fighter units raided Luftwaffe airfields. As part of 100 Group, it was flown as a night fighter and as an intruder supporting Bomber Command heavy bombers that reduced losses during 1944 and 1945.Hastings 1979, p. 240.\n\nAs a fighter-bomber and strike aircraft in the Second Tactical Air Force () and Coastal Command, the Mosquito took often part in \"special raids\". One of the best-known was Operation Jericho – an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944.  Other 2TAF operations included precision attacks against military intelligence, security or police facilities (such as Gestapo headquarters). From 1943, Mosquitos with RAF Coastal Command attacked Kriegsmarine U-boats (particularly in 1943 in the Bay of Biscay, where significant numbers were sunk or damaged) and intercepted transport ship concentrations. 2TAF Mosquitos also supported the British Army during the 1944 Normandy Campaign. However, the defensive advantages of its speeds enabled by the Mosquito unique construction, also represented its \"Achilles heel\" on close air support or anti-shipping operations: the vulnerability to AA and cannon fire – relative to its contemporaries – of the Mosquito's wooden airframe, fuselage and surfaces. This contributed to the longevity and esteem in which the Bristol Beaufighter was held, as a maritime strike aircraft and in the ground attack role (in the Mediterranean, Asia and Pacific).  \n\nThe Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and other air forces in the European, Mediterranean and Italian theatres. The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the South East Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War. During the 1950s, the RAF replaced the Mosquito with the jet-powered English Electric Canberra.\n\nDevelopment\n\nBy the early-mid-1930s, de Havilland had a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer. The later DH.91 Albatross airliner pioneered the composite wood construction used for the Mosquito. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at 210 mph at , 100 mph faster than the Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing.Stroud 1990, p. 369. The wooden monocoque construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time.Bowman 2005, p. 9.\n\nAir Ministry bomber requirements and concepts\n\nOn 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.13/36, which called for a twin-engine medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of  for 3000 mi with a maximum speed of 275 mph at 15000 ft; a maximum bomb load of 8000 lb that could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.  Aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the Avro Manchester and Handley Page Halifax.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31.\n\nIn May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, George Volkert, the chief designer of Handley Page, put forward the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In 20 pages, Volkert planned an aerodynamically clean medium bomber to carry 3000 lb of bombs at a cruising speed of 300 mph. There was support in the RAF and Air Ministry; Captain R N Liptrot, Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert's design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the new Supermarine Spitfire. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily be faster than enemy fighters for long.Buttler 2004, pp. 76–77. The ministry was also considering using non-strategic materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, had led to specification B.9/38 and the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle medium bomber, largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. The idea of a small, fast bomber gained support at a much earlier stage than sometimes acknowledged though it was likely that the Air Ministry envisaged it using light alloy components.Buttler 2004, pp. 74, 77.\n\nInception of the de Havilland fast bomber\n\n Based on his experience with the Albatross, Geoffrey de Havilland believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification.Birtles 2017, ch. 2. Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (H-engine) as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of aluminium and steel but supplies of wood-based products were \"adequate.\"  Although inferior in tension, the strength to weight ratio of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible.\n\nA follow-up letter to Freeman on 27 July said that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin-powered aircraft and either the top speed or load capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of  carrying a 4000 lb bomb load, with a maximum of 260 mph at , and a cruising speed of 230 mph at . De Havilland believed that a compromise, including eliminating surplus equipment, would improve matters. On 4 October 1938, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and six or eight forward-firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of  it would have a top speed of 300 mph and cruising speed of 268 mph at .\n\nStill believing this could be improved, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.\n\nBy September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs.Buttler 2004, p. 78. One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single   Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of 47 ft and capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb load . On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, de Havilland wrote \"...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.\" By 4 October work had progressed to a twin-engine light bomber with a wingspan of 51 ft, and powered by Merlin or Griffon engines, the Merlin favoured due to availability. On 7 October 1939, a month into the war, the nucleus of a design team under Eric Bishop moved to the security and secrecy of Salisbury Hall to work on what was later known as the DH.98.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34. For more versatility, Bishop made provision for four 20 mm cannon in the forward half of the bomb bay, under the cockpit, firing via blast tubes and troughs under the fuselage.Bowman 2005, p. 11.\n\nThe DH.98 was too radical for the Ministry, which wanted a heavily armed, multi-role aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and general purpose roles, as well as capable of carrying torpedoes.  With outbreak of war, the Ministry became more receptive, but still sceptical about an unarmed bomber. It thought the Germans would produce fighters faster than expected.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 31–32. It suggested two forward and two rear-firing machine guns for defence.Bowman 2005, p. 10. The Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at least a third crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights. The Air Council added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of 275 mph at  on two-thirds engine power, and a range of  with a 4000 lb bomb load. To appease the Ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.\n\nOn 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, Blackburn, and Bristol, Air Marshal Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the Rolls-Royce Griffon and the Napier Sabre. Although estimates were presented for a slightly larger Griffon-powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, Freeman got the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of 400 mph at .Buttler 2004, p. 79.\n\nOn 12 December, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command met to finalize the design and decide how to fit it in the RAF's aims. The AOC-in-C would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted on its suitability for reconnaissance missions with F8 or F24 cameras.Bowman 2005, p. 12. After company representatives, the Ministry and the RAF's operational commands examined a full-scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project received backing.Buttler 2004, p. 80. This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Freeman chaired a meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly (Buchanan's chief of staff). de Havilland claimed the DH.98 was the \"fastest bomber in the world...it must be useful\". Freeman supported it for RAF service, ordering a single prototype for an unarmed bomber to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two  Rolls-Royce RM3SM (an early designation for the Merlin 21) with ducted radiators, capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb load. The aircraft was to have a speed of 397 mph at  and a cruising speed of 327 mph at  with a range of  at  on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be .\n\nOn 1 March 1940, Air Marshal Roderic Hill issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the factory serial E0234.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 35.Price 2009, p. 51. In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20 mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland were authorized to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after debate that this prototype, given the military serial number W4052, would carry Airborne Interception (AI) Mk.IV equipment as a day and night fighter. By June 1940, the DH.98 had been named \"Mosquito\". Having the fighter variant kept the Mosquito project alive as there was still criticism within the government and Air Ministry of the usefulness of an unarmed bomber, even after the prototype had shown its capabilities.\n\nProject Mosquito\n\nWith design of the DH.98 started, mock-ups were built, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, where E0234 was later constructed. Initially, the concept was for the crew to be enclosed in the fuselage behind a transparent nose (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a conventional canopy.Thirsk 2006, p. 18.\n\nThe construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the Battle of Dunkirk, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production, decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1942.\n\nBeaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project should stop, but he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 37. In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production should focus on five existing types, namely the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane fighter, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley, and Bristol Blenheim bombers. Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped. Apparently the project shut down when the design team were denied materials for the prototype.Jackson 2003, p. 7.\n\nThe Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland's General Manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitos by December 1941. This was only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland's primary work of producing Tiger Moth and Airspeed Oxford trainers, repairing Hurricanes and manufacturing Merlin engines under licence. In promising Beaverbrook such a number by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that they could be built in such a limited time. As it transpired, only 20 aircraft were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 35–36, 82. During the Battle of Britain, interruptions to production due to air raid warnings caused nearly a third of de Havilland's factory time to be lost.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 38. Nevertheless, work on the prototype went ahead quickly at Salisbury Hall since E0234 was completed by November 1940.Thirsk 2006, p. 19.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.Thirsk 2006, p. 178. This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid nose housing four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.\n\nPrototypes and test flights\n\nOn 3 November 1940, the aircraft, painted in \"prototype yellow\" and still coded E0234, was dis-assembled and transported by road to Hatfield, and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed, driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers. Successful engine runs were made on 19 November. On 24 November, successful taxiing trials were carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., who was the company's chief test pilot. Then on 25 November, the prototype made its first flight, piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., accompanied by John E. Walker, the Chief Engine Installation Designer. \n\nFor this maiden flight, E0234, weighing 14150 lb, took off from the grass airstrip at the Hatfield site. The takeoff was reported as \"straightforward and easy\" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was attained.Thirsk 2006, p. 25. The aircraft reached 220 mph, with the only problem being the undercarriage doors – which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs – that remained open by some 12 in at that speed. This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of E0234 also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment, i.e., a slight change in the angle of the wing, was carried out before further flights.Bowman 2005, p. 18.\n\nOn 5 December 1940, the prototype, now with its military serial number W4050, experienced tail buffeting at speeds between 240 mph and 255 mph. The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from rear section of the inner engine nacelles was disturbed, leading to a localised stall and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from forcefully striking the tailplane, non-retractable slots fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane were experimented with.Thirsk 2006, pp. 27–29. These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced but did not cure the tailplane buffeting.Thirsk 2006, pp. 28–29.\n\nIn February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some 10 in behind the wing's trailing edge: this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections.Bowman 2005, p. 19. With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew W4050 on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it might completely replace the Bristol Beaufighter (in the night fighter role).\n\nDuring its trials on 16 January 1941, W4050 outpaced a Spitfire at 6000 ft. The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the Spitfire Mk II, but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being 20 mph faster. Over the next few months, W4050 surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at RAF Boscombe Down in February 1941, reaching a top speed of 392 mph at 22000 ft altitude, compared to a top speed of 360 mph at 19500 ft for the Spitfire.\n\nOn 19 February, official trials began at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE)  based at Boscombe Down, although de Havilland's representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 44–45. On 24 February, as W4050 taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing. Repairs were made by early March, using part of the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype W4051. In spite of this setback, the Initial Handling Report 767 issued by the A&AEE stated \"The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... Aileron control light and effective ...\" The maximum speed reached was 388 mph at , with an estimated maximum ceiling of 33900 ft and a maximum rate of climb of  at 11400 ft.\n\nW4050 continued to be used for various test programs, essentially as the experimental \"workhorse\" for the Mosquito family.Thirsk 2006, pp. 15–16. In late October 1941, it returned to the factory to be fitted with Merlin 61s, the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 47. W4050 recorded a maximum speed of 428 mph at  (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snowguards, engines in F.S. gear) and 437 mph at 29200 ft without snowguards.Thirsk 2006, p. 34. In October 1942, in connection with development work on the NF Mk XV, W4050 was fitted with extended wingtips increasing the span to 59 ft, first flying in this configuration on 8 December.Thirsk 2006, p. 35. Finally, fitted with high-altitude rated two-stage, two-speed Merlin 77s, it reached 439 mph in December 1943.\n\nSoon after these flights, W4050 was grounded and scheduled to be scrapped, but instead served as an instructional airframe at Hatfield. In September 1958, W4050 was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar where it was built, restored to its original configuration, and became one of the primary exhibits of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.Thirsk 2006, 36–38.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?vgfXNXGGNRws&feature\nrelated Time-lapse footage of restoration work on W4050, 9 January 2011.] Retrieved: 3 January 2012.\n\nW4051, which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in W4050 meant that W4051's fuselage was used as a replacement; W4051 was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the 19 ft \"No. 1\"  tailplane used by W4050, but had production standard 54 ft wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally.Thirsk 2006, p. 269.\n\nConstruction of the fighter prototype, W4052 was also carried out at the secret Salisbury Hall facility. This differed from the bomber brethren in a number of ways: it was powered by 1460 hp Merlin 21s; had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen; a solid nose mounted four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns and their ammunition boxes, accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.;Thirsk 2006, p. 125. four 20 mm Hispano Mk II cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay; and the automatic bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors, which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes.Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.\n\nIn accordance with its role as a day/night fighter prototype W4052 was equipped with AI Mk.IV equipment, complete with an \"arrowhead\"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a \"Special Night\" finish.Thirsk 2006, pp. 124–127. It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles.Thirsk 2006, p. 126. W4052 was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, barrage balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems that enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab.\n\nThe prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.\n\n4055 flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941.\n\nDuring flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. W4050 was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. W4052 had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was mounted around the fuselage behind the wing and was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January – August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.\n\nProduction plans and American interest\n\nThe Air Ministry authorised mass production plans on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world's fastest operational aircraft. They ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, it was confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.   By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by de Havilland Canada.Bowman 2005, p. 24.\n\nOn 20 April 1941, W4050 was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote \"I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nd7pNBSRkEiQ&feature=related \"WWII US Film on Mosquito.\"] youtube.com. Retrieved: 3 January 2012.\n\nThe trials set up future production plans between Britain, Australia and Canada. Six days later Arnold returned to America with a full set of manufacturer's drawings. As a result of his report five companies (Beech; Curtiss-Wright; Fairchild; Fleetwings; and Hughes) were asked to evaluate the de Havilland data. The report by Beech Aircraft summed up the general view: \"It appears as though this airplane has sacrificed serviceability, structural strength, ease of construction and flying characteristics in an attempt to use construction material which is not suitable for the manufacture of efficient airplanes.\" The Americans did not pursue the proposal for licensed production, the consensus arguing that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning could fulfill the same duties. However, Arnold urged the United States Army Air Forces to evaluate the design even if they would not adopt it. On 12 December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF requested one airframe for this purpose.Bowman 2005, p. 20.\n\nDesign and Manufacture\n\nOverview\n\nWhile timber construction was considered outmoded by some, de Havilland claimed that their successes with techniques used for the DH 91 Albatross could lead to a fast light bomber using monocoque sandwich shell construction.Birtles 2017, chs. 2, 3. Arguments in favor of this included speed of prototyping, rapid development, minimisation of jig building time, and employment of a separate category of workforce. At the same time, they had to fight conservative Air Ministry views on defensive armament. Guns and gun turrets would spoil the streamlining, losing speed and maneuverability. The ply-balsa-ply monocoque fuselage and one-piece wings with doped fabric covering gave smooth aerodynamic performance and low weight, combined with strength and stiffness. Whilst submitting these arguments, Geoffrey de Havilland funded his private venture until the eleventh hour. It was a success beyond all expectations. The initial bomber and photo reconnaissance versions were extremely fast, whilst the armament of subsequent variants might be regarded as primarily offensive.\n\nThe most-produced variant, designated the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers. The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20 mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to 2000 lb of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 17.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe design was noted for light and effective control surfaces that provided good manoeuvrability but required that the rudder not be used aggressively at high speeds. Poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 28–29. (FB 6 notes) For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to 201 mph and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable 150 mph for low speed flying. For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was 200 mph at 17000 lb weight.\n\nThe Mosquito had a low stalling speed of 121 mph with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stalling speed decreased to 100 -. Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was 100 -. Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur 12 mph before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).\n\nEarly on in the Mosquito's operational life, the intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by 10 - per hour.\n\nFuselage\n\nThe oval-section fuselage was a frameless monocoque shell built in two vertically-separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with band clamps. The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply outers, with cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main areas of the sandwich skin were only  thick.Aviation, May and June, 1944, Vol. 43, Nos. 5 & 6, McGraw Hill, New York; Design Analysis No 6, DeHavilland Mosquito, Online PDF courtesy of J.L. McClellan, 2005, [http://legendsintheirowntime.com/LiTOT/Mosquito/Mosquito_draft.pdf accessed 23 August 2017] Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.Bowman 2005, p. 15.\n\nWork on the separate half-fuselages included installation of control mechanisms and cabling. Screwed inserts into the inner skins that would be under stress in service were reinforced using round shear plates made from a fabric-Bakelite composite.Aviation, 1944 p. 8.\n \nTransverse bulkheads were also compositely built-up with several species of timber, plywood and balsa. Seven vertically-halved bulkheads were installed within each moulded fuselage shell before the main \"boxing up\" operation. Bulkhead number seven was especially strongly built, since it carried the fitments and transmitted the aerodynamic loadings for the tailplane and rudder.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 378. The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, strongly reinforced, that allowed the fuselage to be lowered onto the wing centre-section at a later stage of assembly.Aviation, 1944 p. 6.\n\nFor early production aircraft, the structural assembly adhesive was Casein-based. At a later stage, this was replaced by \"Aerolite\", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde type, which was more durable.Thirsk 2006, p. 43. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves (\"boxing up\"), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut was a form of V-groove. Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap-strips on the outside of the shells. The half-bulkheads of each shell were bonded to their corresponding pair in a similar way.\nTwo laminated wooden clamps were used in the after portion of the fuselage to provide supports during this complex gluing work. The resulting large structural components had to be kept completely still and held in the correct environment until the glue cured.Jackson 2003, p. 8.\n\nFor finishing, a covering of doped Madapolam (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and several coats of red, followed by silver dope were added, followed by the final camouflage paint.Thirsk 2006, p. 42.\n\nWing\n\nThe all-wood wing pairs comprised a single structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint.Aviation, 1944 pp. 11-13. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There was a single continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar was one of the most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.\n\nSpruce and plywood ribs were connected with gusset joints. Some heavy-duty ribs contained pieces of ash and walnut as well as the special five ply that included veneers laid up at 45 degrees. The upper skin construction was in two layers of 0.25 in. five ply birch, separated by Douglas fir stringers running in the span-wise direction.Aviation, 1944 p. 12.\n\nThe wings were covered with Madapolam fabric and doped in a similar manner to the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points.Batchelor, John and Malcolm Low. de Havilland Mosquito Manual (Plane Essentials). Victoria, Australia: Publishing Solutions, 2008. .Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.Jackson 2003, p. 87.\n\nThe wing contained metal framed and skinned ailerons, but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts.Jackson 2003, p. 9. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction.Miracle and Donaldson 2001, p. 870. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought 22 in further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator, were aluminium framed and fabric covered. The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only 280 lb.[http://www.airforce.gov.au/RAAFMuseum/exhibitions/restoration/dh_98.htm \"History of the de Havilland Mosquito.\"] RAAF Museum Point Cook, 2007. Retrieved: 13 August 2009.\n\nIn November 1944, several crashes occurred in the Far East. At first, it was thought these were as a result of wing structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to \"lift\" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that \"the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season\".   However, a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford, which found faults in six Mosquito marks (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants). The defects were similar, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack.\n\nThe investigators concluded that there were construction defects at the two plants. They found that the \"...standard of glueing...left much to be desired.”Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.Bowman 2012, p. 306 Records at the time showed that accidents caused by \"loss of control\" were three times more frequent on Mosquitos than on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major de Havilland's initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused \"largely by climate\"Bowman 2012, p. 266 To solve the problem of seepage into the interior a strip of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint.\n\nSystems\n\nThe fuel systems gave the Mosquito good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained 58 impgal of fuel.Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes). These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing 143 impgal, located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit.Bowman 2005, p. 22. In the FB.VI, these tanks contained 25 impgal each, while in the B.IV and other unarmed Mosquitos each of the two centre tanks contained 68 impgal.Air Ministry 1943, p. 6. (B IV notes).Air Ministry 1944, p. 6. (PR VIII, PR IX, B IX, PR XVI, B XVI notes). Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the \"main tanks\" and the total internal fuel load of 452 impgal was initially deemed appropriate for the type. In addition, the FB Mk VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to 63 impgal. Drop tanks of 50 impgal or 100 impgal could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to 615 or.\n\nThe design of the Mark VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific to depth charges for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a 100 impgal drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells.Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes) The FB.VI had a wingspan of 54 ft, a length (over guns) of 41 ft. It had a maximum speed of 378 mph at 13200 ft. Maximum take-off weight was 22300 lb and the range of the aircraft was 1120 mi with a service ceiling of 26000 ft.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, pp. 16–17.\n\nTo reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes of photographic reconnaissance variants, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot's seat controlled the pressure valve. As the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 13–14. (FB 6 Notes)\n\nThe engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a 15 impgal oil tank, including a  air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes).\n\nElectrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes).\n\nThe main landing gear, housed in the nacelles behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel.Bishop 1995, Appendix 1 The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles, performing medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attacks and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive, until the end of the war.Bowman 2005, p. 7.\n\nIn July 1941, the first production Mosquito W 4051 (a production fuselage combined with some prototype flying surfaces – see section of Article \"Prototypes and test flights\") was sent to No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), at RAF Benson.  Consequently, the secret reconnaissance flights of this aircraft were the first active service missions of the Mosquito. In 1944, the journal Flight  gave 19 September 1941 as date of the first PR mission, at an altitude \"of some 20 000 ft.\"\n\nOn 15 November 1941, 105 Squadron, RAF, took delivery at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, of the first operational Mosquito Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064.Scott 1999, p. 6. Throughout 1942, 105 Sdn., based next at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks.Wooldridge 1993, Frontispiece. Apart from the Oslo and Berlin raids, the strikes were mainly on industrial and infrastructure targets in occupied Netherlands and Norway, France and northern and western Germany.Scott 1999, p. v – Foreword by Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, which they called snappers. Germany still controlled continental airspace, and the Fw 190s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude. Collisions within the formations also caused casualties. It was the Mosquito’s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated those evasions that were successful.Scott, 1999, pp 25, 32 – 33, 37 – 38\nThe Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September. It was featured in The Times on the 28 September, and the next day the newspaper published two captioned photographs illustrating the bomb strikes and damage.\nIn another example of the daylight precision raids carried out by the Mosquitos of 105 and 139 Sqns., on 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis' seizure of power, a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Commander in Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was speaking, putting his speech off the air. A second sortie in the afternoon inconvenienced another speech, by Goebbels.Simons 2011, p. 160. Lecturing a group of German aircraft manufacturers, Göring said: \nDuring this daylight-raiding phase, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons flew 139 combat operations and aircrew losses were high.Birtles 2017, ch. 10. Even the losses incurred in the squadrons' dangerous Blenheim era were exceeded in percentage terms. The Roll of Honour shows 51 aircrew deaths from the end of May 1942 to April 1943.Scott, 1999, pp 197 – 200  In the corresponding period, crews gained three Mentions in Despatches, two DFMs and three DFCs. The low-level daylight attacks finished on 27 May 1943 with strikes on the Schott glass and Zeiss instrument works, both in Jena. Subsequently, when low-level precision attacks required Mosquitos, they were allotted to squadrons operating the FB.IV version. Examples include the Aarhus Air Raid and Operation Jericho.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the German fighter force had become seriously overstretched.Boog et al 2006, pp 160-166. In April 1943, in response to \"political humiliation\" caused by the Mosquito, Göring ordered the formation of special Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Major Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were \"little more than glorified squadrons\", were unsuccessful against the elusive RAF aircraft.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79. Post-war German histories also indicate that there was a belief within the Luftwaffe that Mosquito aircraft \"gave only a weak radar signal.\".Boog et al 2006, p166\n\nThe first Mosquito Squadron to be equipped with Oboe (navigation) was No. 109, based at RAF Wyton, after working as an experimental unit at RAF Boscombe Down. They used Oboe in anger for the first time on 31 December 1942/1 January 1943, target marking for a force of heavy bombers attacking Düsseldorf.. On the 1st. June, the two pioneering Squadrons joined 109 Squadron in the re-formed No. 8 Group RAF(Bomber Command). Initially they were engaged in moderately high level (about 10 000 ft.) night bombing, with 67 trips during that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadron bombers were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force.\n\nIn what were, initially, diversionary \"nuisance raids,\" Mosquito bombers dropped 4,000 lb Blockbuster bombs or \"Cookies.\" Particularly after the introduction of H2S (radar) in some Mosquitos, these raids carrying larger bombs succeeded to the extent that they provided a significant additional form of attack to the large formations of \"heavies.\" Birtles Chapter 10 Latterly in the war, there were a significant number of all-Mosquito raids on big German cities involving up to one hundred or more aircraft. On the night of 20/21 February 1945, for example, Mosquitos of No. 8 Group mounted the first of 36 consecutive night raids on Berlin.Harris 1993, p. 43.\n\nDespite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito bomber variants ended the war with the lowest losses  of any of the types in RAF Bomber Command service.\n\nThe Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew these variants. For example, Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos.\n\nMosquitos of No. 100 Group RAF acted as night intruders operating at high level in support of the Bomber Command \"heavies\", to counter the enemy tactic of merging into the bomber stream, which, towards the end of 1943, was causing serious allied losses.Harris 1993, p. 126. These RCM (radio countermeasures) aircraft were fitted with a device called \"Serrate\" to allow them to track down German night fighters from their Lichtenstein B/C (low-UHF-band) and Lichtenstein SN-2 (lower end of the VHF FM broadcast band) radar emissions, as well as a device named \"Perfectos\" that tracked German IFF signals. These methods were responsible for the destruction of 257 German aircraft from December 1943 to April 1945. Mosquito fighters from all units accounted for 487 German aircraft during the war, the vast majority of which were night fighters.Boiten 1997, pp. 188–189.\n\nOne Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of Versuchsverband OKLs, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.Thomas and Ketley 2003, pp. 178–179.\n\nThe Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats.Bowman 2005, p. 119.\n\nThe last operational RAF Mosquitos were the Mosquito TT.35's, which were finally retired from No. 3 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co-Operation Unit (CAACU) in May 1963.\n\nVariants\n\nUntil the end of 1942 the RAF always used Roman numerals (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943–1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively.\n\nPrototypes\n\nThree prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was W4050 on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter W4052 on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype W4051 on 10 June 1941. W4051 later flew operationally with 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU).\n\nPhoto-reconnaissance\n\nA total of 10 Mosquito PR Mk Is were built, four of them \"long range\" versions equipped with a 151 impgal overload fuel tank in the fuselage. The contract called for 10 of the PR Mk I airframes to be converted to B Mk IV Series 1s.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 41–42, 423.  All of the PR Mk Is, and the B Mk IV Series 1s, had the original short engine nacelles and short span (19 ft 5.5 in) tailplanes. Their engine cowlings incorporated the original pattern of integrated exhaust manifolds, which, after relatively brief flight time, had a troublesome habit of burning and blistering the cowling panels.Thirsk 2006, pp. 60, 269–270. The first operational sortie by a Mosquito was made by a PR Mk I, W4055, on 17 September 1941; during this sortie the unarmed Mosquito PR.I evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at 23000 ft.Bowman 2005, p. 27. Powered by two Merlin 21s, the PR Mk I had a maximum speed of 382 mph, a cruise speed of 255 mph, a ceiling of 35000 ft, a range of 2180 nmi, and a climb rate of 2850 ft per minute.\n\nOver 30 Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were converted into the PR Mk IV photo-reconnaissance aircraft.Thirsk 2006, p. 268. The first operational flight by a PR Mk IV was made by DK284 in April 1942.Bowman 2005, p. 164.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk VIII, built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using 1565 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s. The first PR Mk VIII, DK324 first flew on 20 October 1942.Thirsk 2006, p. 272. The PR Mk VIII had a maximum speed of 436 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft, a ceiling of 38000 ft, a range of 2550 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (760 m).Bowman 2005, p. 25.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk IX, 90 of which were built, was the first Mosquito variant with two-stage, two-speed engines to be produced in quantity; the first of these, LR405, first flew in April 1943. The PR Mk IX was based on the Mosquito B Mk IX bomber and was powered by two 1680 hp Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 engines. It could carry either two 50 impgal, two 100 impgal or two 200 impgal droppable fuel tanks.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk XVI had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling 760 impgal in the bomb bay, and could also carry two 50 impgal or 100 impgal drop tanks.Thirsk 2006, pp. 274–275. A total of 435 of the PR Mk XVI were built. The PR Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 415 mph, a cruise speed of 250 mph, ceiling of 38500 ft, a range of 2450 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m).\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk 32 was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged 1960 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs.Bowman 2005, p. 165.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk 34 and PR Mk 34A was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons—the equivalent of 5419 mi. A further two 200-gallon (910-litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of 3600 mi cruising at 300 mph. Powered by two 1690 hp Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by Percival Aircraft Company at Luton. The PR.34's maximum speed (TAS) was 335 mi/h at sea level, 405 mi/h at 17000 ft and 425 mi/h at 30000 ft.[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%200399.html?tracked=1 \"The Latest Mosquitoes.\"] Flight, 28 February 1946 via flightglobal.com. Retrieved: 17 August 2010.\nAll PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering 1710 hp.Bowman 2005, p. 166.\n\nColonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote: \"I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war\".Stanley 2010, p. 35.\n\nAfter the end of World War II Spartan Air Services used ten ex-RAF Mosquitoes, mostly B.35's plus one of only six PR.35's built, for high-altitude photographic survey work in Canada.\n\nBombers\n\nOn 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitos, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the B Mk IV Series 1. W4052 was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941.Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23.\n\nThe bomber prototype led to the B Mk IV, of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes.Jackson 2003, p. 15. Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having a larger bomb bay to increase the payload to four 500 lb bombs, instead of the four 250 lb bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by shortening the tail of the 500 lb bomb so that these four larger weapons could be carried (or a 2,000 lb (920;kg) total load). The B Mk IV entered service in May 1942 with 105 Squadron.\n\nIn April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk IV to carry a 4000 lb Blockbuster bomb (nicknamed a Cookie). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward and 54 B.IVs were modified and distributed to squadrons of the Light Night Striking Force.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 306–307 27 B Mk IVs were later converted for special operations with the Highball anti-shipping weapon, and were used by 618 Squadron, formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74, 76–78. A B Mk IV, DK290 was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by DZ471,530 and 533.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74–75. The B Mk IV had a maximum speed of 380 mph, a cruising speed of 265 mph, ceiling of 34000 ft, a range of 2040 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (762 m).\n\nOther bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered B Mk V high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with W4057, which had strengthened wings and two additional fuel tanks, or alternatively, two 500 lb bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only W4057 was built in prototype form.Jackson 2003, p. 16. The Merlin 31 powered B Mk VII was built by de Havilland Canada and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada, 25 were built. Six were handed over to the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nB Mk IX (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype DK 324 was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943.Jackson 2003, p. 17. In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk IVs and all B Mk IXs then in service would be converted to carry the 4000 lb \"Cookie\", and all B Mk IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 306 The B Mk IX had a maximum speed of 408 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft,  ceiling of 36000 ft, a range of 2450 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (869 m). The IX could carry a maximum load of 2000 - of bombs. A Mosquito B Mk IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. LR503, known as \"F for Freddie\" (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with No. 109 and subsequently, No. 105 RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after Victory in Europe Day, killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar.Bowman 2005, p. 70.\n\nThe B Mk XVI was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the 4000 lb \"Cookie\". The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. DZ540 first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the B Mk XX, was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 408 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft, ceiling of 37000 ft, a range of 1485 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,800 ft per minute (853 m). The type could carry 4000 lb of bombs.\n\nThe B.35 was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance).  The B.35 had a maximum speed of 422 mph, a cruising speed of 276 mph, ceiling of 42000 ft, a range of 1750 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,700 ft per minute (823 m).Bowman 2005, p. 26. A total of 174 B.35s were delivered up to the end of 1945.  A further 100 were delivered from 1946 for a grand total of 274, 65 of which were built by Airspeed Ltd.\n\nFighters\n\nDeveloped during 1940, the first prototype of the Mosquito F Mk II was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitos were fitted with four 20 mm Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs. The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.Bowman 2005, p. 13.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Britain experienced day-time incursions of the high-altitude reconnaissance bomber, the Junkers Ju-86P.Birtles 2017, ch. 6. Although the Ju-86P only carried a light bomb load, it overflew sensitive areas, including Bristol, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Bombs were dropped on Luton and elsewhere, and this particular aircraft was seen from the main de Havilland offices and factory at Hatfield. An attempt to intercept it with a Spitfire from RAF Manston was unsuccessful. As a result of the potential threat, a decision was quickly taken to develop a high-altitude Mosquito interceptor, using the MP469 prototype.\n\nMP469 entered the experimental shop on the 7 September and made its initial flight on the 14 September, piloted by John de Havilland. The bomber nose was altered using a normal fighter nose, armed with four standard .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. The low pressure cabin retained a bomber canopy structure and a two-piece windscreen. The control wheel was replaced with a fighter control stick. The wingspan was increased to 59 ft. The airframe was lightened by removing armour plating, some fuel tanks and other fitments. Smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of  this HA Mk XV was  lighter than a standard Mk II. For this first conversion, the engines were a pair of Merlin 61s. On 15 September, John de Havilland reached an altitude of  in this version. The aircraft was delivered to a High Altitude Flight which had been formed at RAF Northolt. However, the high-level German daylight intruders were no longer to be seen. It was subsequently revealed that only five Ju-86P aircraft had been built and they had only flown twelve sorties. Nevertheless, the general need for high altitude interceptors was recognised - but now the emphasis was to be upon night fighters.\n\nThe A&AEE tested the climb and speed of night fighter conversion of MP469 in January 1943 for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.Aircraft And Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, Mosquito NF MkXV MP469, Short performance and handling trials, January 1943; Online PDF, Courtesy of Neil Stirling\n[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/mp469.pdf, accessed 14 Aug 2017] Wingspan had been increased to 62 ft, the Brownings had been moved to a fairing below the fuselage. According to Birtles, an AI radar was mounted in the nose and the Merlins were upgraded to Mk76 type, although Boscombe Down reported Merlin 61s. In addition to MP469, four more B Mk IVs were converted into NF MK XVs.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 63–67. The Fighter Interception Unit at RAF Ford carried out service trials, March 1943, and then these five aircraft went to 85 Squadron, Hunsdon, where they were flown from April until August of that year. The greatest height reached in service was .\n\nApart from the F Mk XV, all Mosquito fighters and fighter bombers featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece armoured windscreen, and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.Scutts 1993, pp. 4–5.\n\nNight fighters\n\nAt the end of 1940, the Air Staff's preferred turret-equipped night fighter design to Operational Requirement O.R. 95 was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company's design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito, when fitted with a turret would be considered for the night fighter requirement.Buttler pp. 61–62\n\nThe first production night fighter Mosquitos - minus turrets - were designated NF Mk II. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings.Scutts 1993, p. 7. A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 338–339. 23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy.Scutts 1993, p. 8.\n\nNinety-seven NF Mk IIs were upgraded with 3.3 GHz frequency, low-SHF-band AI Mk VIII radar and these were designated NF Mk XII. The NF Mk XIII, of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk XII conversions. These \"centimetric\" radar sets were mounted in a solid \"thimble\" (Mk XII / XIII) or universal \"bull nose\" (Mk XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with.\n\nFour F Mk XVs were converted to the NF Mk XV. These were fitted with AI Mk VIII in a \"thimble\" radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 65–67.\n\n NF Mk XVII was the designation for 99 NF Mk II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.\n\nThe NF Mk XIX was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.\n\nThe NF Mk 30 was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two 1710 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk 30 had a maximum speed of 424 mph at 26500 ft.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 434. It also carried early electronic countermeasures equipment. 526 were built.\n\nOther Mosquito night fighter variants planned but never built included the NF Mk X and NF Mk XIV (the latter based on the NF Mk XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The NF Mk 31 was a variant of the NF Mk 30, but powered by Packard Merlins.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 396, 398.\n\nAfter the war, two more night fighter versions were developed:\nThe NF Mk 36 was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk X radar. Powered by two 1690 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were 305 mi/h at sea level, 380 mi/h at 17000 ft, and 405 mi/h at 30000 ft.\n\nThe NF Mk 38, 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 61. According to the Pilot's Notes and Air Ministry 'Special Flying Instruction TF/487', which posted limits on the Mosquito's maximum speeds, the NF Mk 38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425 mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to 10000 ft. However, from 10,000 to 15000 ft the maximum speed was 348 knots (400 mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to 20000 ft 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to 25000 ft, 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to 30000 ft, 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to 35000 ft, 235 knots (270 mph). With two added 100-gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379 mph); between 15,000 and 20000 ft 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to 25000 ft, 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to 30000 ft, 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to 35000 ft, 235 knots (270 mph). Little difference was noted above 15000 ft.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 38–39. (NF 38 Notes)\n\nStrike (\"fighter-bomber\") variants \n\nThe FB Mk VI, which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two, single-stage two-speed, 1460 hp Merlin 21s or 1635 hp Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced \"basic\" wing structure capable of carrying single 250 or bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single 50 impgal or 100 impgal drop tanks to be carried under each wing.Streetly 1981, p. 177. The usual fixed armament was four 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, while two 250 or bombs could be carried in the bomb bay.\n\nUnlike the F Mk II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors.Thirsk 2006, pp. 50, 208, 216. The maximum fuel load was  distributed between 453 impgal internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of  capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two 100 impgal drop tanks. All-out level speed is often given as 368 mi/h, although this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (HJ679) fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be 384 mi/h, in line with expectations.[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/hj679-dh.pdf \"Mosquito FB. Mk. VI HJ.679 – Brief performance trials, A. & A.E.E. Boscombe Down \"] via wwiiaircraftperformance.org. Retrieved: 17 August 2010. 2,298 FB Mk VIs were built, nearly one-third of Mosquito production. Two were converted to TR.33 carrier-borne, maritime strike prototypes.\n\nThe FB Mk VI proved capable of holding its own against fighter aircraft, in addition to strike/bombing roles. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of 143 Squadron were engaged by 30 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 5: the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, but lost five Mosquitos (two reportedly to flak),Bird 2003, pp. 94 – 98. while shooting down five Fw 190s.Bowman 2005, p. 112. \nHowever, the loss of a two-seat, twin engine aircraft like the Mosquito represented a more costly loss than a single-seat, single-engine fighter (like the Fw 190). The loss of two Mosquitos to flak also underlined the vulnerability of the type to AA artillery – a flaw that contributed to the Bristol Beaufighter constituting the backbone of Commonwealth strike and ground attack squadrons around the world, until the end of the war. \n\nAnother fighter-bomber variant was the Mosquito FB Mk XVIII (sometimes known as the Tsetse) of which one was converted from a FB Mk VI to serve as prototype and 17 were purpose-built. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins \"6-pounder Class M\" cannon: this was a modified QF 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank gun fitted with an auto-loader to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire. 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing 1580 lb.  In addition, 900 lb of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from heavily armed U-boats, the intended primary target of the Mk XVIII.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 271. Two or four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to \"sight\" the main weapon onto the target.\n\nThe Air Ministry initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making its wooden construction an even greater liability, in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2950 ft/s and an excellent range of some . It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from 5000 ft at a 30° angle with the turn and bank indicator on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun.Bowman 2005, p. 105. The prototype HJ732 was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.\n\nThe effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 Ju 88s. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March,  was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitos.Bowman 2005, pp. 106–106. On 10 June,  was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a Liberator of No. 206 Squadron.Bowman 2005, p. 108. On 5 April 1945 Mosquitos with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the Kattegat and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them.Bowman 2005, p. 115.Bowman 1997, p. 77. A German Sperrbrecher (\"minefield breaker\") was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by Swedish vessels. Some 900 German soldiers died in total. On 9 April, German U-boats ,  and  were spotted in formation heading for Norway. All were sunk.Bowman 1997, p. 78.  and  followed on 19 April and 2 May 1945.Bowman 2005, pp. 117, 119.\n\nDespite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger, 96 mm calibre QF 32-pounder, a gun based on the QF 3.7 inch AA gun designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of muzzle brake. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.\n\nDesigns based on the Mk VI were the FB Mk 26, built in Canada, and the FB Mk 40, built in Australia, powered by Packard Merlins. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using 1620 hp single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard. 212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s, one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43 trainers. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.\n\nTrainers\n\nThe Mosquito was also built as the Mosquito T Mk III two-seat trainer. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the T Mk III were built for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. de Havilland Australia built 11 T Mk 43 trainers, similar to the Mk III.\n\nTorpedo-bombers\n\nTo meet specification N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33 with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by Eric \"Winkle\" Brown aboard HMS Indefatigable, the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20 mm cannon, two 500 lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60 lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33's AN/APS-6.\n\nTarget tugs\n\nThe RAF's target tug version was the Mosquito TT Mk 35, which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service with No 3 CAACU at Exeter, being finally retired in 1963. These aircraft were then featured in the film 633 Squadron.\nA number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The Royal Navy also operated the Mosquito TT Mk 39 for target towing.\nTwo ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at Manchester (Ringway) Airport by Fairey Aviation in 1953–1954, and delivered to the Belgian Air Force for use as towing aircraft from the Sylt firing ranges.\n\nCanadian-built\n\nA total of 1,032 Birtles 2017, Appendix III (wartime \n+ 2 afterwards) Mosquitos were built by De Havilland Canada at Downsview Airfield in Downsview Ontario (now Downsview Park in Toronto Ontario).\n* Mosquito B Mk VII : Canadian version based on the Mosquito B Mk V bomber aircraft.

A total of 11 FB Mk 40s were converted into Mosquito T Mk 43s.\n\nHighball\n\nA number of Mosquito IVs were modified by Vickers-Armstrongs to carry Highball \"bouncing bombs\" and were allocated Vickers Type numbers:\n* Type 463 – Prototype Highball conversion of Mosquito IV DZ741.\n* Type 465 – Conversion of 33 Mosquito IVs to carry Highball.\n\nProduction\n\nAbout 5,000 of the total of 7,781 Mosquitos built had major structural components fabricated from wood in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England.Cole, Roger. High Wycombe – Local History Series. Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK: Tempus Publishing Ltd., 2001. . Fuselages, wings and tailplanes were made at furniture companies such as Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll, Austinsuite and Styles & Mealing. Wing spars were made by J. B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in the Buckinghamshire town. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their factory on the outskirts of High Wycombe.\n\nInitially much of the specialised yellow birch wood veneer and finished plywood used for the prototypes and early production aircraft was brought in Liberty Ships from firms in Wisconsin, US.Connor-Madison 2007, pp. 2-3. Prominent in this role were Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing in Marshfield. In conjunction with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory, Hamilton Roddis had developed new plywood adhesives and hot pressing technology.[http://www.foresthistory.org/publications/fht/fhtspringfall2005/fht05_hotr_wisconsin.pdf Forest History, Fall 2005, pp. 65–66] Retrieved: 30 July 2013. \n\nCanada\n\nIn July 1941, it was decided that DH Canada would build Mosquitos at Downsview, Ontario. This was to continue even if Germany invaded Great Britain.Birtles 2017, ch. 8. Packard Merlin engines produced under licence were bench-tested by August and the first two aircraft were built in September. Production was to increase to fifty per month by early 1942. Initially, the Canadian production was for bomber variants; later, fighters, fighter-bombers and training aircraft were also made. DH Chief Production Engineer, Harry Povey, was sent first, then W. D. Hunter followed on an extended stay, to liaise with materials and parts suppliers. As was the case with initial UK production, Tego-bonded plywood and birch veneer was obtained from firms in Wisconsin, principally Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing, Marshfield.\"Connor-Madison, p. 11.\" Enemy action delayed the shipping of jigs and moulds and it was decided to build these locally.  During 1942, production improved to over 80 machines per month, as sub-contractors and suppliers became established. A mechanised production line based in part on car building methods started in 1944.Toronto Air and Space Museum, \"Community Memories - Mosquito Aircraft Production at Downsview”,\n[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?idstory_line&lg\nEnglish&fl0&ex\n00000430&sl3189&pos\n1 Accessed 11 September 2017] When flight testing could no longer keep up, this was moved to the Central Aircraft Company airfield, London, Ontario, where the approved Mosquitos left for commissioning and subsequent ferry transfer to Europe.\n\nFerrying Mosquitos and many other types of WWII aircraft from Canada to Europe was dangerous, resulting in losses of lives and machines, but in the exigencies of war it was regarded as the best option for twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft. In the parlance of the day, among RAF personnel, ″it was no piece of cake.″  \n\"A Country by Consent – World War II – Ferry Command, by Carl A. Christie\",\n[http://www.canadahistoryproject.ca/1939-45/1939-45-09-ferry-command.html Accessed 11 September 2017]. Considerable efforts were made by de Havilland Canada to resolve problems with engine and oil systems and an additional five hours of flight testing were introduced before the ferry flight. Although this reduced the number of aircraft missing, the actual cause of some of the losses was unknown. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been ferried successfully by the Canadian operation.Hotson 1983, pp. 77–87.\n\nAfter DH Canada had been established for the Mosquito, further manufacturing was set up at DH Australia, in Sydney. One of the DH staff who travelled there was the distinguished test pilot, Pat Fillingham. These production lines added totals of 1,133Thirsk 2006, p. 52. aircraft of varying types from Canada plus 212 aircraft from Australia.\n\nExports\n\nIn total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR. XVIs to Australia; two FB.VI and 18 NF.30s to Belgium; approximately 250 FB.26, T.29 and T.27s from Canada to Nationalist China. A significant number never went into service due to deterioration on the voyage and to crashes during Chinese pilot training, however five were captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War;\"Birtles\" Chap.8 19 FB.VIs to Czechoslovakia in 1948; 6 FB.VIs to Dominica; a few B.IVs, 57 FB.VIs, 29 PR.XVIs and 23 NF.XXXs to France. Some T.IIIs were exported to Israel along with 60 FB.VIs, and at least five PR.XVIs and 14 naval versions. Four T.IIIs, 76 FB.VIs, one FB.40 and four T.43s were exported to New Zealand. Three T.IIIs were exported to Norway, and 18 FB.VIs, which were later converted to night fighter standard. South Africa received two F.II and 14 PR.XVI/XIs and Sweden received 60 NF.XIXs.

    "aggregatedText" : "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito was a British twin-engine shoulder-winged multi-role combat aircraft. The crew of two, pilot and navigator, sat side by side. It served during and after the Second World War. It was one of few operational front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed The Wooden Wonder.Price 2009, p. 3. The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the \"Mossie\" to its crews.Hanson, Dave. [http://www.warbirdalley.com/mossie.htm \"deHavilland DH 98 Mosquito.\"] warbirdalley.com. Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to roles including low to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, neutral countries, through enemy-controlled airspace.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 338. A single passenger could ride in the aircraft's bomb bay when it was adapted for the purpose.\n\nWhen Mosquito production began in 1941 it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.Bowman 2005, p. 21. Entering service in late 1941, the first Mosquito variant was an unarmed high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Subsequent versions continued in this role throughout the war. The first Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064, entered service with No. 105 Squadron on 15 November 1941. From mid-1942 to mid-1943, Mosquito bombers flew high-speed, medium or low-altitude daylight missions against factories, railways and other pinpoint targets in Germany and German-occupied Europe. From June 1943, Mosquito bombers were formed into the Light Night Strike Force and used as pathfinders for RAF Bomber Command heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as \"nuisance\" bombers, often dropping Blockbuster bombs – 4,000 lb (1,812 kg) \"cookies\" – in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.\n\nAs a night fighter from mid-1942, the Mosquito intercepted Luftwaffe raids on Britain, notably those of Operation Steinbock in 1944. Starting in July 1942, Mosquito night-fighter units raided Luftwaffe airfields. As part of 100 Group, it was flown as a night fighter and as an intruder supporting Bomber Command heavy bombers that reduced losses during 1944 and 1945.Hastings 1979, p. 240.\n\nAs a fighter-bomber and strike aircraft in the Second Tactical Air Force () and Coastal Command, the Mosquito took often part in \"special raids\". One of the best-known was Operation Jericho – an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944.  Other 2TAF operations included precision attacks against military intelligence, security or police facilities (such as Gestapo headquarters). From 1943, Mosquitos with RAF Coastal Command attacked Kriegsmarine U-boats (particularly in 1943 in the Bay of Biscay, where significant numbers were sunk or damaged) and intercepted transport ship concentrations. 2TAF Mosquitos also supported the British Army during the 1944 Normandy Campaign. However, the defensive advantages of its speeds enabled by the Mosquito unique construction, also represented its \"Achilles heel\" on close air support or anti-shipping operations: the vulnerability to AA and cannon fire – relative to its contemporaries – of the Mosquito's wooden airframe, fuselage and surfaces. This contributed to the longevity and esteem in which the Bristol Beaufighter was held, as a maritime strike aircraft and in the ground attack role (in the Mediterranean, Asia and Pacific).  \n\nThe Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and other air forces in the European, Mediterranean and Italian theatres. The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the South East Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War. During the 1950s, the RAF replaced the Mosquito with the jet-powered English Electric Canberra.\n\nDevelopment\n\nBy the early-mid-1930s, de Havilland had a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer. The later DH.91 Albatross airliner pioneered the composite wood construction used for the Mosquito. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at 210 mph at , 100 mph faster than the Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing.Stroud 1990, p. 369. The wooden monocoque construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time.Bowman 2005, p. 9.\n\nAir Ministry bomber requirements and concepts\n\nOn 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.13/36, which called for a twin-engine medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of  for 3000 mi with a maximum speed of 275 mph at 15000 ft; a maximum bomb load of 8000 lb that could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.  Aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the Avro Manchester and Handley Page Halifax.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31.\n\nIn May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, George Volkert, the chief designer of Handley Page, put forward the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In 20 pages, Volkert planned an aerodynamically clean medium bomber to carry 3000 lb of bombs at a cruising speed of 300 mph. There was support in the RAF and Air Ministry; Captain R N Liptrot, Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert's design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the new Supermarine Spitfire. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily be faster than enemy fighters for long.Buttler 2004, pp. 76–77. The ministry was also considering using non-strategic materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, had led to specification B.9/38 and the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle medium bomber, largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. The idea of a small, fast bomber gained support at a much earlier stage than sometimes acknowledged though it was likely that the Air Ministry envisaged it using light alloy components.Buttler 2004, pp. 74, 77.\n\nInception of the de Havilland fast bomber\n\n Based on his experience with the Albatross, Geoffrey de Havilland believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification.Birtles 2017, ch. 2. Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (H-engine) as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of aluminium and steel but supplies of wood-based products were \"adequate.\"  Although inferior in tension, the strength to weight ratio of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible.\n\nA follow-up letter to Freeman on 27 July said that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin-powered aircraft and either the top speed or load capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of  carrying a 4000 lb bomb load, with a maximum of 260 mph at , and a cruising speed of 230 mph at . De Havilland believed that a compromise, including eliminating surplus equipment, would improve matters. On 4 October 1938, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and six or eight forward-firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of  it would have a top speed of 300 mph and cruising speed of 268 mph at .\n\nStill believing this could be improved, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.\n\nBy September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs.Buttler 2004, p. 78. One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single   Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of 47 ft and capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb load . On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, de Havilland wrote \"...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.\" By 4 October work had progressed to a twin-engine light bomber with a wingspan of 51 ft, and powered by Merlin or Griffon engines, the Merlin favoured due to availability. On 7 October 1939, a month into the war, the nucleus of a design team under Eric Bishop moved to the security and secrecy of Salisbury Hall to work on what was later known as the DH.98.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34. For more versatility, Bishop made provision for four 20 mm cannon in the forward half of the bomb bay, under the cockpit, firing via blast tubes and troughs under the fuselage.Bowman 2005, p. 11.\n\nThe DH.98 was too radical for the Ministry, which wanted a heavily armed, multi-role aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and general purpose roles, as well as capable of carrying torpedoes.  With outbreak of war, the Ministry became more receptive, but still sceptical about an unarmed bomber. It thought the Germans would produce fighters faster than expected.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 31–32. It suggested two forward and two rear-firing machine guns for defence.Bowman 2005, p. 10. The Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at least a third crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights. The Air Council added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of 275 mph at  on two-thirds engine power, and a range of  with a 4000 lb bomb load. To appease the Ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.\n\nOn 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, Blackburn, and Bristol, Air Marshal Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the Rolls-Royce Griffon and the Napier Sabre. Although estimates were presented for a slightly larger Griffon-powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, Freeman got the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of 400 mph at .Buttler 2004, p. 79.\n\nOn 12 December, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command met to finalize the design and decide how to fit it in the RAF's aims. The AOC-in-C would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted on its suitability for reconnaissance missions with F8 or F24 cameras.Bowman 2005, p. 12. After company representatives, the Ministry and the RAF's operational commands examined a full-scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project received backing.Buttler 2004, p. 80. This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Freeman chaired a meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly (Buchanan's chief of staff). de Havilland claimed the DH.98 was the \"fastest bomber in the world...it must be useful\". Freeman supported it for RAF service, ordering a single prototype for an unarmed bomber to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two  Rolls-Royce RM3SM (an early designation for the Merlin 21) with ducted radiators, capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb load. The aircraft was to have a speed of 397 mph at  and a cruising speed of 327 mph at  with a range of  at  on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be .\n\nOn 1 March 1940, Air Marshal Roderic Hill issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the factory serial E0234.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 35.Price 2009, p. 51. In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20 mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland were authorized to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after debate that this prototype, given the military serial number W4052, would carry Airborne Interception (AI) Mk.IV equipment as a day and night fighter. By June 1940, the DH.98 had been named \"Mosquito\". Having the fighter variant kept the Mosquito project alive as there was still criticism within the government and Air Ministry of the usefulness of an unarmed bomber, even after the prototype had shown its capabilities.\n\nProject Mosquito\n\nWith design of the DH.98 started, mock-ups were built, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, where E0234 was later constructed. Initially, the concept was for the crew to be enclosed in the fuselage behind a transparent nose (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a conventional canopy.Thirsk 2006, p. 18.\n\nThe construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the Battle of Dunkirk, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production, decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1942.\n\nBeaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project should stop, but he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 37. In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production should focus on five existing types, namely the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane fighter, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley, and Bristol Blenheim bombers. Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped. Apparently the project shut down when the design team were denied materials for the prototype.Jackson 2003, p. 7.\n\nThe Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland's General Manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitos by December 1941. This was only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland's primary work of producing Tiger Moth and Airspeed Oxford trainers, repairing Hurricanes and manufacturing Merlin engines under licence. In promising Beaverbrook such a number by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that they could be built in such a limited time. As it transpired, only 20 aircraft were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 35–36, 82. During the Battle of Britain, interruptions to production due to air raid warnings caused nearly a third of de Havilland's factory time to be lost.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 38. Nevertheless, work on the prototype went ahead quickly at Salisbury Hall since E0234 was completed by November 1940.Thirsk 2006, p. 19.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.Thirsk 2006, p. 178. This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid nose housing four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.\n\nPrototypes and test flights\n\nOn 3 November 1940, the aircraft, painted in \"prototype yellow\" and still coded E0234, was dis-assembled and transported by road to Hatfield, and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed, driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers. Successful engine runs were made on 19 November. On 24 November, successful taxiing trials were carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., who was the company's chief test pilot. Then on 25 November, the prototype made its first flight, piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., accompanied by John E. Walker, the Chief Engine Installation Designer. \n\nFor this maiden flight, E0234, weighing 14150 lb, took off from the grass airstrip at the Hatfield site. The takeoff was reported as \"straightforward and easy\" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was attained.Thirsk 2006, p. 25. The aircraft reached 220 mph, with the only problem being the undercarriage doors – which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs – that remained open by some 12 in at that speed. This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of E0234 also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment, i.e., a slight change in the angle of the wing, was carried out before further flights.Bowman 2005, p. 18.\n\nOn 5 December 1940, the prototype, now with its military serial number W4050, experienced tail buffeting at speeds between 240 mph and 255 mph. The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from rear section of the inner engine nacelles was disturbed, leading to a localised stall and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from forcefully striking the tailplane, non-retractable slots fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane were experimented with.Thirsk 2006, pp. 27–29. These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced but did not cure the tailplane buffeting.Thirsk 2006, pp. 28–29.\n\nIn February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some 10 in behind the wing's trailing edge: this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections.Bowman 2005, p. 19. With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew W4050 on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it might completely replace the Bristol Beaufighter (in the night fighter role).\n\nDuring its trials on 16 January 1941, W4050 outpaced a Spitfire at 6000 ft. The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the Spitfire Mk II, but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being 20 mph faster. Over the next few months, W4050 surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at RAF Boscombe Down in February 1941, reaching a top speed of 392 mph at 22000 ft altitude, compared to a top speed of 360 mph at 19500 ft for the Spitfire.\n\nOn 19 February, official trials began at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE)  based at Boscombe Down, although de Havilland's representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 44–45. On 24 February, as W4050 taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing. Repairs were made by early March, using part of the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype W4051. In spite of this setback, the Initial Handling Report 767 issued by the A&AEE stated \"The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... Aileron control light and effective ...\" The maximum speed reached was 388 mph at , with an estimated maximum ceiling of 33900 ft and a maximum rate of climb of  at 11400 ft.\n\nW4050 continued to be used for various test programs, essentially as the experimental \"workhorse\" for the Mosquito family.Thirsk 2006, pp. 15–16. In late October 1941, it returned to the factory to be fitted with Merlin 61s, the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 47. W4050 recorded a maximum speed of 428 mph at  (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snowguards, engines in F.S. gear) and 437 mph at 29200 ft without snowguards.Thirsk 2006, p. 34. In October 1942, in connection with development work on the NF Mk XV, W4050 was fitted with extended wingtips increasing the span to 59 ft, first flying in this configuration on 8 December.Thirsk 2006, p. 35. Finally, fitted with high-altitude rated two-stage, two-speed Merlin 77s, it reached 439 mph in December 1943.\n\nSoon after these flights, W4050 was grounded and scheduled to be scrapped, but instead served as an instructional airframe at Hatfield. In September 1958, W4050 was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar where it was built, restored to its original configuration, and became one of the primary exhibits of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.Thirsk 2006, 36–38.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?vgfXNXGGNRws&feature\nrelated Time-lapse footage of restoration work on W4050, 9 January 2011.] Retrieved: 3 January 2012.\n\nW4051, which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in W4050 meant that W4051's fuselage was used as a replacement; W4051 was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the 19 ft \"No. 1\"  tailplane used by W4050, but had production standard 54 ft wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally.Thirsk 2006, p. 269.\n\nConstruction of the fighter prototype, W4052 was also carried out at the secret Salisbury Hall facility. This differed from the bomber brethren in a number of ways: it was powered by 1460 hp Merlin 21s; had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen; a solid nose mounted four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns and their ammunition boxes, accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.;Thirsk 2006, p. 125. four 20 mm Hispano Mk II cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay; and the automatic bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors, which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes.Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.\n\nIn accordance with its role as a day/night fighter prototype W4052 was equipped with AI Mk.IV equipment, complete with an \"arrowhead\"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a \"Special Night\" finish.Thirsk 2006, pp. 124–127. It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles.Thirsk 2006, p. 126. W4052 was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, barrage balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems that enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab.\n\nThe prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.\n\n4055 flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941.\n\nDuring flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. W4050 was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. W4052 had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was mounted around the fuselage behind the wing and was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January – August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.\n\nProduction plans and American interest\n\nThe Air Ministry authorised mass production plans on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world's fastest operational aircraft. They ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, it was confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.   By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by de Havilland Canada.Bowman 2005, p. 24.\n\nOn 20 April 1941, W4050 was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote \"I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\nd7pNBSRkEiQ&feature=related \"WWII US Film on Mosquito.\"] youtube.com. Retrieved: 3 January 2012.\n\nThe trials set up future production plans between Britain, Australia and Canada. Six days later Arnold returned to America with a full set of manufacturer's drawings. As a result of his report five companies (Beech; Curtiss-Wright; Fairchild; Fleetwings; and Hughes) were asked to evaluate the de Havilland data. The report by Beech Aircraft summed up the general view: \"It appears as though this airplane has sacrificed serviceability, structural strength, ease of construction and flying characteristics in an attempt to use construction material which is not suitable for the manufacture of efficient airplanes.\" The Americans did not pursue the proposal for licensed production, the consensus arguing that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning could fulfill the same duties. However, Arnold urged the United States Army Air Forces to evaluate the design even if they would not adopt it. On 12 December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF requested one airframe for this purpose.Bowman 2005, p. 20.\n\nDesign and Manufacture\n\nOverview\n\nWhile timber construction was considered outmoded by some, de Havilland claimed that their successes with techniques used for the DH 91 Albatross could lead to a fast light bomber using monocoque sandwich shell construction.Birtles 2017, chs. 2, 3. Arguments in favor of this included speed of prototyping, rapid development, minimisation of jig building time, and employment of a separate category of workforce. At the same time, they had to fight conservative Air Ministry views on defensive armament. Guns and gun turrets would spoil the streamlining, losing speed and maneuverability. The ply-balsa-ply monocoque fuselage and one-piece wings with doped fabric covering gave smooth aerodynamic performance and low weight, combined with strength and stiffness. Whilst submitting these arguments, Geoffrey de Havilland funded his private venture until the eleventh hour. It was a success beyond all expectations. The initial bomber and photo reconnaissance versions were extremely fast, whilst the armament of subsequent variants might be regarded as primarily offensive.\n\nThe most-produced variant, designated the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers. The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20 mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to 2000 lb of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 17.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe design was noted for light and effective control surfaces that provided good manoeuvrability but required that the rudder not be used aggressively at high speeds. Poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 28–29. (FB 6 notes) For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to 201 mph and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable 150 mph for low speed flying. For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was 200 mph at 17000 lb weight.\n\nThe Mosquito had a low stalling speed of 121 mph with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stalling speed decreased to 100 -. Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was 100 -. Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur 12 mph before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).\n\nEarly on in the Mosquito's operational life, the intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by 10 - per hour.\n\nFuselage\n\nThe oval-section fuselage was a frameless monocoque shell built in two vertically-separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with band clamps. The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply outers, with cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main areas of the sandwich skin were only  thick.Aviation, May and June, 1944, Vol. 43, Nos. 5 & 6, McGraw Hill, New York; Design Analysis No 6, DeHavilland Mosquito, Online PDF courtesy of J.L. McClellan, 2005, [http://legendsintheirowntime.com/LiTOT/Mosquito/Mosquito_draft.pdf accessed 23 August 2017] Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.Bowman 2005, p. 15.\n\nWork on the separate half-fuselages included installation of control mechanisms and cabling. Screwed inserts into the inner skins that would be under stress in service were reinforced using round shear plates made from a fabric-Bakelite composite.Aviation, 1944 p. 8.\n \nTransverse bulkheads were also compositely built-up with several species of timber, plywood and balsa. Seven vertically-halved bulkheads were installed within each moulded fuselage shell before the main \"boxing up\" operation. Bulkhead number seven was especially strongly built, since it carried the fitments and transmitted the aerodynamic loadings for the tailplane and rudder.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 378. The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, strongly reinforced, that allowed the fuselage to be lowered onto the wing centre-section at a later stage of assembly.Aviation, 1944 p. 6.\n\nFor early production aircraft, the structural assembly adhesive was Casein-based. At a later stage, this was replaced by \"Aerolite\", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde type, which was more durable.Thirsk 2006, p. 43. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves (\"boxing up\"), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut was a form of V-groove. Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap-strips on the outside of the shells. The half-bulkheads of each shell were bonded to their corresponding pair in a similar way.\nTwo laminated wooden clamps were used in the after portion of the fuselage to provide supports during this complex gluing work. The resulting large structural components had to be kept completely still and held in the correct environment until the glue cured.Jackson 2003, p. 8.\n\nFor finishing, a covering of doped Madapolam (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and several coats of red, followed by silver dope were added, followed by the final camouflage paint.Thirsk 2006, p. 42.\n\nWing\n\nThe all-wood wing pairs comprised a single structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint.Aviation, 1944 pp. 11-13. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There was a single continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar was one of the most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.\n\nSpruce and plywood ribs were connected with gusset joints. Some heavy-duty ribs contained pieces of ash and walnut as well as the special five ply that included veneers laid up at 45 degrees. The upper skin construction was in two layers of 0.25 in. five ply birch, separated by Douglas fir stringers running in the span-wise direction.Aviation, 1944 p. 12.\n\nThe wings were covered with Madapolam fabric and doped in a similar manner to the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points.Batchelor, John and Malcolm Low. de Havilland Mosquito Manual (Plane Essentials). Victoria, Australia: Publishing Solutions, 2008. .Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.Jackson 2003, p. 87.\n\nThe wing contained metal framed and skinned ailerons, but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts.Jackson 2003, p. 9. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction.Miracle and Donaldson 2001, p. 870. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought 22 in further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator, were aluminium framed and fabric covered. The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only 280 lb.[http://www.airforce.gov.au/RAAFMuseum/exhibitions/restoration/dh_98.htm \"History of the de Havilland Mosquito.\"] RAAF Museum Point Cook, 2007. Retrieved: 13 August 2009.\n\nIn November 1944, several crashes occurred in the Far East. At first, it was thought these were as a result of wing structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to \"lift\" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that \"the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season\".   However, a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford, which found faults in six Mosquito marks (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants). The defects were similar, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack.\n\nThe investigators concluded that there were construction defects at the two plants. They found that the \"...standard of glueing...left much to be desired.”Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.Bowman 2012, p. 306 Records at the time showed that accidents caused by \"loss of control\" were three times more frequent on Mosquitos than on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major de Havilland's initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused \"largely by climate\"Bowman 2012, p. 266 To solve the problem of seepage into the interior a strip of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint.\n\nSystems\n\nThe fuel systems gave the Mosquito good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained 58 impgal of fuel.Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes). These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing 143 impgal, located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit.Bowman 2005, p. 22. In the FB.VI, these tanks contained 25 impgal each, while in the B.IV and other unarmed Mosquitos each of the two centre tanks contained 68 impgal.Air Ministry 1943, p. 6. (B IV notes).Air Ministry 1944, p. 6. (PR VIII, PR IX, B IX, PR XVI, B XVI notes). Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the \"main tanks\" and the total internal fuel load of 452 impgal was initially deemed appropriate for the type. In addition, the FB Mk VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to 63 impgal. Drop tanks of 50 impgal or 100 impgal could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to 615 or.\n\nThe design of the Mark VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific to depth charges for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a 100 impgal drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells.Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes) The FB.VI had a wingspan of 54 ft, a length (over guns) of 41 ft. It had a maximum speed of 378 mph at 13200 ft. Maximum take-off weight was 22300 lb and the range of the aircraft was 1120 mi with a service ceiling of 26000 ft.Batchelor and Lowe 2008, pp. 16–17.\n\nTo reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes of photographic reconnaissance variants, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot's seat controlled the pressure valve. As the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 13–14. (FB 6 Notes)\n\nThe engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a 15 impgal oil tank, including a  air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes).\n\nElectrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes).\n\nThe main landing gear, housed in the nacelles behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel.Bishop 1995, Appendix 1 The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles, performing medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attacks and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive, until the end of the war.Bowman 2005, p. 7.\n\nIn July 1941, the first production Mosquito W 4051 (a production fuselage combined with some prototype flying surfaces – see section of Article \"Prototypes and test flights\") was sent to No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), at RAF Benson.  Consequently, the secret reconnaissance flights of this aircraft were the first active service missions of the Mosquito. In 1944, the journal Flight  gave 19 September 1941 as date of the first PR mission, at an altitude \"of some 20 000 ft.\"\n\nOn 15 November 1941, 105 Squadron, RAF, took delivery at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, of the first operational Mosquito Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064.Scott 1999, p. 6. Throughout 1942, 105 Sdn., based next at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks.Wooldridge 1993, Frontispiece. Apart from the Oslo and Berlin raids, the strikes were mainly on industrial and infrastructure targets in occupied Netherlands and Norway, France and northern and western Germany.Scott 1999, p. v – Foreword by Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, which they called snappers. Germany still controlled continental airspace, and the Fw 190s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude. Collisions within the formations also caused casualties. It was the Mosquito’s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated those evasions that were successful.Scott, 1999, pp 25, 32 – 33, 37 – 38\nThe Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September. It was featured in The Times on the 28 September, and the next day the newspaper published two captioned photographs illustrating the bomb strikes and damage.\nIn another example of the daylight precision raids carried out by the Mosquitos of 105 and 139 Sqns., on 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis' seizure of power, a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Commander in Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was speaking, putting his speech off the air. A second sortie in the afternoon inconvenienced another speech, by Goebbels.Simons 2011, p. 160. Lecturing a group of German aircraft manufacturers, Göring said: \nDuring this daylight-raiding phase, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons flew 139 combat operations and aircrew losses were high.Birtles 2017, ch. 10. Even the losses incurred in the squadrons' dangerous Blenheim era were exceeded in percentage terms. The Roll of Honour shows 51 aircrew deaths from the end of May 1942 to April 1943.Scott, 1999, pp 197 – 200  In the corresponding period, crews gained three Mentions in Despatches, two DFMs and three DFCs. The low-level daylight attacks finished on 27 May 1943 with strikes on the Schott glass and Zeiss instrument works, both in Jena. Subsequently, when low-level precision attacks required Mosquitos, they were allotted to squadrons operating the FB.IV version. Examples include the Aarhus Air Raid and Operation Jericho.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the German fighter force had become seriously overstretched.Boog et al 2006, pp 160-166. In April 1943, in response to \"political humiliation\" caused by the Mosquito, Göring ordered the formation of special Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Major Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were \"little more than glorified squadrons\", were unsuccessful against the elusive RAF aircraft.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79. Post-war German histories also indicate that there was a belief within the Luftwaffe that Mosquito aircraft \"gave only a weak radar signal.\".Boog et al 2006, p166\n\nThe first Mosquito Squadron to be equipped with Oboe (navigation) was No. 109, based at RAF Wyton, after working as an experimental unit at RAF Boscombe Down. They used Oboe in anger for the first time on 31 December 1942/1 January 1943, target marking for a force of heavy bombers attacking Düsseldorf.. On the 1st. June, the two pioneering Squadrons joined 109 Squadron in the re-formed No. 8 Group RAF(Bomber Command). Initially they were engaged in moderately high level (about 10 000 ft.) night bombing, with 67 trips during that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadron bombers were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force.\n\nIn what were, initially, diversionary \"nuisance raids,\" Mosquito bombers dropped 4,000 lb Blockbuster bombs or \"Cookies.\" Particularly after the introduction of H2S (radar) in some Mosquitos, these raids carrying larger bombs succeeded to the extent that they provided a significant additional form of attack to the large formations of \"heavies.\" Birtles Chapter 10 Latterly in the war, there were a significant number of all-Mosquito raids on big German cities involving up to one hundred or more aircraft. On the night of 20/21 February 1945, for example, Mosquitos of No. 8 Group mounted the first of 36 consecutive night raids on Berlin.Harris 1993, p. 43.\n\nDespite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito bomber variants ended the war with the lowest losses  of any of the types in RAF Bomber Command service.\n\nThe Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew these variants. For example, Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos.\n\nMosquitos of No. 100 Group RAF acted as night intruders operating at high level in support of the Bomber Command \"heavies\", to counter the enemy tactic of merging into the bomber stream, which, towards the end of 1943, was causing serious allied losses.Harris 1993, p. 126. These RCM (radio countermeasures) aircraft were fitted with a device called \"Serrate\" to allow them to track down German night fighters from their Lichtenstein B/C (low-UHF-band) and Lichtenstein SN-2 (lower end of the VHF FM broadcast band) radar emissions, as well as a device named \"Perfectos\" that tracked German IFF signals. These methods were responsible for the destruction of 257 German aircraft from December 1943 to April 1945. Mosquito fighters from all units accounted for 487 German aircraft during the war, the vast majority of which were night fighters.Boiten 1997, pp. 188–189.\n\nOne Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of Versuchsverband OKLs, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.Thomas and Ketley 2003, pp. 178–179.\n\nThe Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats.Bowman 2005, p. 119.\n\nThe last operational RAF Mosquitos were the Mosquito TT.35's, which were finally retired from No. 3 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co-Operation Unit (CAACU) in May 1963.\n\nVariants\n\nUntil the end of 1942 the RAF always used Roman numerals (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943–1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively.\n\nPrototypes\n\nThree prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was W4050 on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter W4052 on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype W4051 on 10 June 1941. W4051 later flew operationally with 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU).\n\nPhoto-reconnaissance\n\nA total of 10 Mosquito PR Mk Is were built, four of them \"long range\" versions equipped with a 151 impgal overload fuel tank in the fuselage. The contract called for 10 of the PR Mk I airframes to be converted to B Mk IV Series 1s.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 41–42, 423.  All of the PR Mk Is, and the B Mk IV Series 1s, had the original short engine nacelles and short span (19 ft 5.5 in) tailplanes. Their engine cowlings incorporated the original pattern of integrated exhaust manifolds, which, after relatively brief flight time, had a troublesome habit of burning and blistering the cowling panels.Thirsk 2006, pp. 60, 269–270. The first operational sortie by a Mosquito was made by a PR Mk I, W4055, on 17 September 1941; during this sortie the unarmed Mosquito PR.I evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at 23000 ft.Bowman 2005, p. 27. Powered by two Merlin 21s, the PR Mk I had a maximum speed of 382 mph, a cruise speed of 255 mph, a ceiling of 35000 ft, a range of 2180 nmi, and a climb rate of 2850 ft per minute.\n\nOver 30 Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were converted into the PR Mk IV photo-reconnaissance aircraft.Thirsk 2006, p. 268. The first operational flight by a PR Mk IV was made by DK284 in April 1942.Bowman 2005, p. 164.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk VIII, built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using 1565 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s. The first PR Mk VIII, DK324 first flew on 20 October 1942.Thirsk 2006, p. 272. The PR Mk VIII had a maximum speed of 436 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft, a ceiling of 38000 ft, a range of 2550 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (760 m).Bowman 2005, p. 25.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk IX, 90 of which were built, was the first Mosquito variant with two-stage, two-speed engines to be produced in quantity; the first of these, LR405, first flew in April 1943. The PR Mk IX was based on the Mosquito B Mk IX bomber and was powered by two 1680 hp Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 engines. It could carry either two 50 impgal, two 100 impgal or two 200 impgal droppable fuel tanks.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk XVI had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling 760 impgal in the bomb bay, and could also carry two 50 impgal or 100 impgal drop tanks.Thirsk 2006, pp. 274–275. A total of 435 of the PR Mk XVI were built. The PR Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 415 mph, a cruise speed of 250 mph, ceiling of 38500 ft, a range of 2450 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m).\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk 32 was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged 1960 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs.Bowman 2005, p. 165.\n\nThe Mosquito PR Mk 34 and PR Mk 34A was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons—the equivalent of 5419 mi. A further two 200-gallon (910-litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of 3600 mi cruising at 300 mph. Powered by two 1690 hp Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by Percival Aircraft Company at Luton. The PR.34's maximum speed (TAS) was 335 mi/h at sea level, 405 mi/h at 17000 ft and 425 mi/h at 30000 ft.[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%200399.html?tracked=1 \"The Latest Mosquitoes.\"] Flight, 28 February 1946 via flightglobal.com. Retrieved: 17 August 2010.\nAll PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering 1710 hp.Bowman 2005, p. 166.\n\nColonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote: \"I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war\".Stanley 2010, p. 35.\n\nAfter the end of World War II Spartan Air Services used ten ex-RAF Mosquitoes, mostly B.35's plus one of only six PR.35's built, for high-altitude photographic survey work in Canada.\n\nBombers\n\nOn 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitos, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the B Mk IV Series 1. W4052 was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941.Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23.\n\nThe bomber prototype led to the B Mk IV, of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes.Jackson 2003, p. 15. Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having a larger bomb bay to increase the payload to four 500 lb bombs, instead of the four 250 lb bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by shortening the tail of the 500 lb bomb so that these four larger weapons could be carried (or a 2,000 lb (920;kg) total load). The B Mk IV entered service in May 1942 with 105 Squadron.\n\nIn April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk IV to carry a 4000 lb Blockbuster bomb (nicknamed a Cookie). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward and 54 B.IVs were modified and distributed to squadrons of the Light Night Striking Force.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 306–307 27 B Mk IVs were later converted for special operations with the Highball anti-shipping weapon, and were used by 618 Squadron, formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74, 76–78. A B Mk IV, DK290 was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by DZ471,530 and 533.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74–75. The B Mk IV had a maximum speed of 380 mph, a cruising speed of 265 mph, ceiling of 34000 ft, a range of 2040 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (762 m).\n\nOther bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered B Mk V high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with W4057, which had strengthened wings and two additional fuel tanks, or alternatively, two 500 lb bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only W4057 was built in prototype form.Jackson 2003, p. 16. The Merlin 31 powered B Mk VII was built by de Havilland Canada and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada, 25 were built. Six were handed over to the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nB Mk IX (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype DK 324 was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943.Jackson 2003, p. 17. In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk IVs and all B Mk IXs then in service would be converted to carry the 4000 lb \"Cookie\", and all B Mk IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 306 The B Mk IX had a maximum speed of 408 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft,  ceiling of 36000 ft, a range of 2450 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (869 m). The IX could carry a maximum load of 2000 - of bombs. A Mosquito B Mk IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. LR503, known as \"F for Freddie\" (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with No. 109 and subsequently, No. 105 RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after Victory in Europe Day, killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar.Bowman 2005, p. 70.\n\nThe B Mk XVI was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the 4000 lb \"Cookie\". The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. DZ540 first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the B Mk XX, was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 408 mph, an economical cruise speed of 295 mph at 20,000 ft, and 350 mph at 30,000 ft, ceiling of 37000 ft, a range of 1485 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,800 ft per minute (853 m). The type could carry 4000 lb of bombs.\n\nThe B.35 was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance).  The B.35 had a maximum speed of 422 mph, a cruising speed of 276 mph, ceiling of 42000 ft, a range of 1750 nmi, and a climb rate of 2,700 ft per minute (823 m).Bowman 2005, p. 26. A total of 174 B.35s were delivered up to the end of 1945.  A further 100 were delivered from 1946 for a grand total of 274, 65 of which were built by Airspeed Ltd.\n\nFighters\n\nDeveloped during 1940, the first prototype of the Mosquito F Mk II was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitos were fitted with four 20 mm Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs. The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.Bowman 2005, p. 13.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Britain experienced day-time incursions of the high-altitude reconnaissance bomber, the Junkers Ju-86P.Birtles 2017, ch. 6. Although the Ju-86P only carried a light bomb load, it overflew sensitive areas, including Bristol, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Bombs were dropped on Luton and elsewhere, and this particular aircraft was seen from the main de Havilland offices and factory at Hatfield. An attempt to intercept it with a Spitfire from RAF Manston was unsuccessful. As a result of the potential threat, a decision was quickly taken to develop a high-altitude Mosquito interceptor, using the MP469 prototype.\n\nMP469 entered the experimental shop on the 7 September and made its initial flight on the 14 September, piloted by John de Havilland. The bomber nose was altered using a normal fighter nose, armed with four standard .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. The low pressure cabin retained a bomber canopy structure and a two-piece windscreen. The control wheel was replaced with a fighter control stick. The wingspan was increased to 59 ft. The airframe was lightened by removing armour plating, some fuel tanks and other fitments. Smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of  this HA Mk XV was  lighter than a standard Mk II. For this first conversion, the engines were a pair of Merlin 61s. On 15 September, John de Havilland reached an altitude of  in this version. The aircraft was delivered to a High Altitude Flight which had been formed at RAF Northolt. However, the high-level German daylight intruders were no longer to be seen. It was subsequently revealed that only five Ju-86P aircraft had been built and they had only flown twelve sorties. Nevertheless, the general need for high altitude interceptors was recognised - but now the emphasis was to be upon night fighters.\n\nThe A&AEE tested the climb and speed of night fighter conversion of MP469 in January 1943 for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.Aircraft And Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, Mosquito NF MkXV MP469, Short performance and handling trials, January 1943; Online PDF, Courtesy of Neil Stirling\n[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/mp469.pdf, accessed 14 Aug 2017] Wingspan had been increased to 62 ft, the Brownings had been moved to a fairing below the fuselage. According to Birtles, an AI radar was mounted in the nose and the Merlins were upgraded to Mk76 type, although Boscombe Down reported Merlin 61s. In addition to MP469, four more B Mk IVs were converted into NF MK XVs.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 63–67. The Fighter Interception Unit at RAF Ford carried out service trials, March 1943, and then these five aircraft went to 85 Squadron, Hunsdon, where they were flown from April until August of that year. The greatest height reached in service was .\n\nApart from the F Mk XV, all Mosquito fighters and fighter bombers featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece armoured windscreen, and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.Scutts 1993, pp. 4–5.\n\nNight fighters\n\nAt the end of 1940, the Air Staff's preferred turret-equipped night fighter design to Operational Requirement O.R. 95 was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company's design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito, when fitted with a turret would be considered for the night fighter requirement.Buttler pp. 61–62\n\nThe first production night fighter Mosquitos - minus turrets - were designated NF Mk II. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings.Scutts 1993, p. 7. A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 338–339. 23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy.Scutts 1993, p. 8.\n\nNinety-seven NF Mk IIs were upgraded with 3.3 GHz frequency, low-SHF-band AI Mk VIII radar and these were designated NF Mk XII. The NF Mk XIII, of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk XII conversions. These \"centimetric\" radar sets were mounted in a solid \"thimble\" (Mk XII / XIII) or universal \"bull nose\" (Mk XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with.\n\nFour F Mk XVs were converted to the NF Mk XV. These were fitted with AI Mk VIII in a \"thimble\" radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 65–67.\n\n NF Mk XVII was the designation for 99 NF Mk II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.\n\nThe NF Mk XIX was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.\n\nThe NF Mk 30 was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two 1710 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk 30 had a maximum speed of 424 mph at 26500 ft.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 434. It also carried early electronic countermeasures equipment. 526 were built.\n\nOther Mosquito night fighter variants planned but never built included the NF Mk X and NF Mk XIV (the latter based on the NF Mk XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The NF Mk 31 was a variant of the NF Mk 30, but powered by Packard Merlins.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 396, 398.\n\nAfter the war, two more night fighter versions were developed:\nThe NF Mk 36 was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk X radar. Powered by two 1690 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were 305 mi/h at sea level, 380 mi/h at 17000 ft, and 405 mi/h at 30000 ft.\n\nThe NF Mk 38, 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 61. According to the Pilot's Notes and Air Ministry 'Special Flying Instruction TF/487', which posted limits on the Mosquito's maximum speeds, the NF Mk 38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425 mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to 10000 ft. However, from 10,000 to 15000 ft the maximum speed was 348 knots (400 mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to 20000 ft 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to 25000 ft, 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to 30000 ft, 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to 35000 ft, 235 knots (270 mph). With two added 100-gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379 mph); between 15,000 and 20000 ft 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to 25000 ft, 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to 30000 ft, 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to 35000 ft, 235 knots (270 mph). Little difference was noted above 15000 ft.Air Ministry 1945, pp. 38–39. (NF 38 Notes)\n\nStrike (\"fighter-bomber\") variants \n\nThe FB Mk VI, which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two, single-stage two-speed, 1460 hp Merlin 21s or 1635 hp Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced \"basic\" wing structure capable of carrying single 250 or bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single 50 impgal or 100 impgal drop tanks to be carried under each wing.Streetly 1981, p. 177. The usual fixed armament was four 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, while two 250 or bombs could be carried in the bomb bay.\n\nUnlike the F Mk II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors.Thirsk 2006, pp. 50, 208, 216. The maximum fuel load was  distributed between 453 impgal internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of  capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two 100 impgal drop tanks. All-out level speed is often given as 368 mi/h, although this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (HJ679) fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be 384 mi/h, in line with expectations.[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/hj679-dh.pdf \"Mosquito FB. Mk. VI HJ.679 – Brief performance trials, A. & A.E.E. Boscombe Down \"] via wwiiaircraftperformance.org. Retrieved: 17 August 2010. 2,298 FB Mk VIs were built, nearly one-third of Mosquito production. Two were converted to TR.33 carrier-borne, maritime strike prototypes.\n\nThe FB Mk VI proved capable of holding its own against fighter aircraft, in addition to strike/bombing roles. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of 143 Squadron were engaged by 30 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 5: the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, but lost five Mosquitos (two reportedly to flak),Bird 2003, pp. 94 – 98. while shooting down five Fw 190s.Bowman 2005, p. 112. \nHowever, the loss of a two-seat, twin engine aircraft like the Mosquito represented a more costly loss than a single-seat, single-engine fighter (like the Fw 190). The loss of two Mosquitos to flak also underlined the vulnerability of the type to AA artillery – a flaw that contributed to the Bristol Beaufighter constituting the backbone of Commonwealth strike and ground attack squadrons around the world, until the end of the war. \n\nAnother fighter-bomber variant was the Mosquito FB Mk XVIII (sometimes known as the Tsetse) of which one was converted from a FB Mk VI to serve as prototype and 17 were purpose-built. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins \"6-pounder Class M\" cannon: this was a modified QF 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank gun fitted with an auto-loader to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire. 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing 1580 lb.  In addition, 900 lb of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from heavily armed U-boats, the intended primary target of the Mk XVIII.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 271. Two or four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to \"sight\" the main weapon onto the target.\n\nThe Air Ministry initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making its wooden construction an even greater liability, in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2950 ft/s and an excellent range of some . It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from 5000 ft at a 30° angle with the turn and bank indicator on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun.Bowman 2005, p. 105. The prototype HJ732 was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.\n\nThe effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 Ju 88s. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March,  was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitos.Bowman 2005, pp. 106–106. On 10 June,  was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a Liberator of No. 206 Squadron.Bowman 2005, p. 108. On 5 April 1945 Mosquitos with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the Kattegat and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them.Bowman 2005, p. 115.Bowman 1997, p. 77. A German Sperrbrecher (\"minefield breaker\") was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by Swedish vessels. Some 900 German soldiers died in total. On 9 April, German U-boats ,  and  were spotted in formation heading for Norway. All were sunk.Bowman 1997, p. 78.  and  followed on 19 April and 2 May 1945.Bowman 2005, pp. 117, 119.\n\nDespite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger, 96 mm calibre QF 32-pounder, a gun based on the QF 3.7 inch AA gun designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of muzzle brake. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.\n\nDesigns based on the Mk VI were the FB Mk 26, built in Canada, and the FB Mk 40, built in Australia, powered by Packard Merlins. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using 1620 hp single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard. 212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s, one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43 trainers. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.\n\nTrainers\n\nThe Mosquito was also built as the Mosquito T Mk III two-seat trainer. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the T Mk III were built for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. de Havilland Australia built 11 T Mk 43 trainers, similar to the Mk III.\n\nTorpedo-bombers\n\nTo meet specification N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33 with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by Eric \"Winkle\" Brown aboard HMS Indefatigable, the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20 mm cannon, two 500 lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60 lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33's AN/APS-6.\n\nTarget tugs\n\nThe RAF's target tug version was the Mosquito TT Mk 35, which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service with No 3 CAACU at Exeter, being finally retired in 1963. These aircraft were then featured in the film 633 Squadron.\nA number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The Royal Navy also operated the Mosquito TT Mk 39 for target towing.\nTwo ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at Manchester (Ringway) Airport by Fairey Aviation in 1953–1954, and delivered to the Belgian Air Force for use as towing aircraft from the Sylt firing ranges.\n\nCanadian-built\n\nA total of 1,032 Birtles 2017, Appendix III (wartime \n+ 2 afterwards) Mosquitos were built by De Havilland Canada at Downsview Airfield in Downsview Ontario (now Downsview Park in Toronto Ontario).\n* Mosquito B Mk VII : Canadian version based on the Mosquito B Mk V bomber aircraft.

High Wycombe – Local History Series. Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK: Tempus Publishing Ltd., 2001. . Fuselages, wings and tailplanes were made at furniture companies such as Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll, Austinsuite and Styles & Mealing. Wing spars were made by J. B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in the Buckinghamshire town. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their factory on the outskirts of High Wycombe.\n\nInitially much of the specialised yellow birch wood veneer and finished plywood used for the prototypes and early production aircraft was brought in Liberty Ships from firms in Wisconsin, US.Connor-Madison 2007, pp. 2-3. Prominent in this role were Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing in Marshfield. In conjunction with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory, Hamilton Roddis had developed new plywood adhesives and hot pressing technology.[http://www.foresthistory.org/publications/fht/fhtspringfall2005/fht05_hotr_wisconsin.pdf Forest History, Fall 2005, pp. 65–66] Retrieved: 30 July 2013. \n\nCanada\n\nIn July 1941, it was decided that DH Canada would build Mosquitos at Downsview, Ontario. This was to continue even if Germany invaded Great Britain.Birtles 2017, ch. 8. Packard Merlin engines produced under licence were bench-tested by August and the first two aircraft were built in September. Production was to increase to fifty per month by early 1942. Initially, the Canadian production was for bomber variants; later, fighters, fighter-bombers and training aircraft were also made. DH Chief Production Engineer, Harry Povey, was sent first, then W. D. Hunter followed on an extended stay, to liaise with materials and parts suppliers. As was the case with initial UK production, Tego-bonded plywood and birch veneer was obtained from firms in Wisconsin, principally Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing, Marshfield.\"Connor-Madison, p. 11.\" Enemy action delayed the shipping of jigs and moulds and it was decided to build these locally.  During 1942, production improved to over 80 machines per month, as sub-contractors and suppliers became established. A mechanised production line based in part on car building methods started in 1944.Toronto Air and Space Museum, \"Community Memories - Mosquito Aircraft Production at Downsview”,\n[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?idstory_line&lg\nEnglish&fl0&ex\n00000430&sl3189&pos\n1 Accessed 11 September 2017] When flight testing could no longer keep up, this was moved to the Central Aircraft Company airfield, London, Ontario, where the approved Mosquitos left for commissioning and subsequent ferry transfer to Europe.\n\nFerrying Mosquitos and many other types of WWII aircraft from Canada to Europe was dangerous, resulting in losses of lives and machines, but in the exigencies of war it was regarded as the best option for twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft. In the parlance of the day, among RAF personnel, ″it was no piece of cake.″  \n\"A Country by Consent – World War II – Ferry Command, by Carl A. Christie\",\n[http://www.canadahistoryproject.ca/1939-45/1939-45-09-ferry-command.html Accessed 11 September 2017]. Considerable efforts were made by de Havilland Canada to resolve problems with engine and oil systems and an additional five hours of flight testing were introduced before the ferry flight. Although this reduced the number of aircraft missing, the actual cause of some of the losses was unknown. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been ferried successfully by the Canadian operation.Hotson 1983, pp. 77–87.\n\nAfter DH Canada had been established for the Mosquito, further manufacturing was set up at DH Australia, in Sydney. One of the DH staff who travelled there was the distinguished test pilot, Pat Fillingham. These production lines added totals of 1,133Thirsk 2006, p. 52. aircraft of varying types from Canada plus 212 aircraft from Australia.\n\nExports\n\nIn total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR.
