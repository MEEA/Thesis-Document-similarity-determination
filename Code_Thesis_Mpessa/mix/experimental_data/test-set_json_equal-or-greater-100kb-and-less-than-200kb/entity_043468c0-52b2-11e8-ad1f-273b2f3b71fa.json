  "textBody" : "Gun laws and policies (collectively referred to as firearms regulation or gun control) regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians. Many countries have restrictive firearm policies, while a few have permissive ones.[http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/193/firearm_regulation_-_guiding_policy/3,212,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,16,17,18,19,22,26,27,28,217,29,30,218,31,33,38,39,40,41,43,44,221,45,46,47,48,49,50,222,52,56,57,58,60,61,62,225,64,65,66,227,69,71,72,231,73,74,75,77,78,79,81,82,83,86,90,91,94,95,233,99,100,102,234,104,105,107,108,110,111,112,236,237,238,240,113,114,116,241,118,242,121,122,123,125,128,129,131,132,275,136,137,139,140,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,150,244,152,153,154,155,158,159,162,163,247,164,166,170,172,174,249,250,251,175,252,177,180,182,183,54,254,184,185,186,187,256,188,189,190,192,194,195,197,199,200,201,257,258,204,205,206 GunPolicy.org – Facts]. The only countries with permissive gun legislation are: Albania, Austria, Chad, Republic of Congo, Honduras, Micronesia, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Tanzania, the United States, Yemen and Zambia. Accessed on August 27, 2016.\nCountries with a strong gun culture may afford civilians a right to keep and bear arms, and have more-liberal gun laws than neighboring jurisdictions.\nCountries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for hunting, sport shooting ( target shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed carry, with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed (such as handguns and other short-barreled weapons).  Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licences may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of domestic violence, alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm licence may have to demonstrate competence by completing a gun-safety course and show provision for a secure location to store weapons.\n\nGuns laws are considered permissive in countries where the authorities will provide a firearm license on a shall issue basis to ordinary citizens who meet the legal requirements.  Guns laws are restrictive when licenses are provided on a may issue basis, at the discretion of the regulating authority, often requiring the applicant to demonstrate a reason why they need a firearm.  Gun laws are considered strict when it is difficult or impossible for an ordinary citizen to obtain a firearm through legal means.\n\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, electroshock weapons, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably high-capacity magazines and sound suppressors.  There may be restrictions on the quantity or types of ammunition purchased, with certain types prohibited. Due to the global scope of this article, detailed coverage cannot be provided on all these matters; the article will instead attempt to briefly summarize each country's weapon laws in regard to small arms use and ownership by civilians.\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons was adopted in Bamako, Mali, on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the 51 member states of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries.\n\nKenya\n\nGun law in Kenya is specified in the Firearms Act (Cap. 114) Laws of Kenya. The Chief Licensing Officer (CLO) has discretion to award, deny, or revoke firearms licenses. Applicants must be 21 years of age or older, pass a stringent background check for criminal activity, mental health and domestic violence, and state genuine reason(s) for their need to privately own and carry a firearm. Checks are regularly repeated, with failure to pass resulting in immediate revocation of the licence. Once licensed to own a gun, no additional permit is required to carry a concealed firearm.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, Firearms Control Act 60 (enacted in 2000) regulates the ownership of firearms by civilians. Ownership of a firearm is conditional on a competency test and several other factors, including a background check of the applicant, inspection of an applicant's premises, and, since July 2004, licensing of the weapon by the police. There are several different firearms licences, allowing different types of weapons for different purposes. Handguns and carrying in public is legal under all licence types with no additional permit.\n\nThe only prohibited small arms are burst-fire and fully automatic firearms, and firearms which have been modified in bore or barrel length without permission.\n\nAmericas\n\nArgentina\n\nFirearms in Argentina are restrictive, and regulated by ANMaC (Agencia Nacional de Materiales Controlados) since late October, 2015 when said agency replaced RENAR (Registro Nacional de Armas de la Republica Argentina), both being a branch of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. To own a firearm in Argentina, one must be a legitimate user. Applicants must: be 21 years of age or older, provide a medical certificate that certifies they are physically and mentally fit, complete a safety course, provide a legitimate mean of income, undergo and pass a background check. A successful applicant is fingerprinted and issued a license which has to be renewed every five years. One may not legally fire a firearm in Argentina if they are not a legitimate user, even if that gun belongs to someone else. Once a legitimate user wants to purchase a firearm, they must provide a secure location to store the firearm(s), and give an acceptable reason for wanting a firearm – such as collecting, target shooting, hunting, business, or self-defense in the home.\n\nFirearms must be purchased through a licensed dealer and registered with ANMaC. If a firearm is inherited, a re-registering form must be filed. There is no limit on the number of firearms owned so long as they are properly stored. Ammunition sales are recorded but unlimited.\n\nCarry permits for licensed handgun owners are extremely difficult to obtain, and require appearing before the ANMaC board to make their case. Carry permits are renewed yearly to re-examine their \"clear and present\" danger, and the permit is usually revoked immediately if this danger is removed. Those dealing in money or valuables or in private security may be issued a business carry permit.\n\nHandguns above .32 calibre are conditional-use; fully automatic handguns are prohibited to civilians. Bolt-action rifles above .22 Long Rifle and semi-automatic rifles above .22 Long Rifle with a non-detachable magazine are conditional-use; fully automatic rifles and semi-automatic rifles above .22 Long Rifle with detachable magazines are prohibited.  Semi-automatic shotguns and shotguns with barrels between 380 and long are conditional use; fully automatic shotguns and shotguns with barrels under 380 mm are prohibited.\n\nBrazil\n\nAll firearms in Brazil are required to be registered. The minimum age for ownership is 25,\nand certificates of aptitude and mental health are required prior to the acquisition of a firearm and every three years thereafter.\nIt is generally illegal to carry a firearm outside a residence.\nExecutive Order  5.123, of 1 July 2004 \nallows the Federal Police to confiscate firearms which are not possessed for a valid reason; self-defense is not considered a valid argument.https://jus.com.br/artigos/30201/a-ilegalidade-na-negativa-a-compra-de-arma-de-fogo\n\nThe total number of firearms in Brazil is thought to be between 14 million and 17 million \nwith an estimated 9 million being unregistered. \nIn a 2005 referendum, Brazilians voted against a government proposal for a total ban on the sales of firearms to private citizens.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada's firearm laws are stated in the Firearms Act. The possession and acquisition licence (PAL) is distributed by the RCMP (federal police) and requires taking a firearms safety course and passing a test, a background check, and reference interviews. The PAL allows purchase of most popular sporting rifles and shotguns. A Restricted-PAL (RPAL) has an additional course for restricted weapons, which have increased storage requirements.\nThe two main reasons for owning firearms are target shooting and hunting. Carrying firearms for self-defense against human threats is prohibited, but a \"wilderness carry permit\" can be obtained for protection against wild animals.\n\nThere is an authorization to transport (ATT) requirement for restricted and prohibited weapons, which must be registered. Non-citizens may obtain a non-resident firearms declaration from a customs officer, for a temporary 60-day authorization to bring a non-prohibited firearm into Canada.\n\nIn Canada, firearms fall into one of three categories:\n# Non-Restricted: Long guns with an overall length greater than 26 in and semi-automatics with a barrel longer than . These can be possessed with an ordinary PAL, and are the only class of firearms which can be used for hunting.\n# Restricted: This includes handguns with barrel lengths greater than 4.1 inches (105 mm), and long guns which do not meet the length requirements for non-restricted but are not prohibited. These guns require ATTs, so can only be discharged at ranges.\n# Prohibited: These weapons generally cannot be possessed by civilians, and include fully automatic weapons and many military arms, and handguns with barrel length equal to or shorter than 4.1 inches (105 mm), and those chambered for .25 and .32 cartridges. Normally, the only way to possess these is by being grandfathered in or through inheritance. Most magazines for semi-automatic long guns capable of holding more than 5 centerfire cartridges or 10 rounds for handguns are prohibited.\n\nChile\n\nIn Chile, the 92nd article of the Constitution declares gun ownership as a privilege granted in accordance to a special law. Firearms are regulated by the police. Civilian gun ownership is allowed by law but discouraged by authorities, with regular press statements and campaigns denouncing the dangers of private firearms.\n\nPolice-issued firearm permits require applicants to be 18 years of age, provide a mental health certificate issued by a psychiatrist, have a clean criminal record with no domestic violence accusations, and pass a written test on firearm safety and knowledge. Final approval is in the hands of the police commander of the district, who can deny the permit in \"justified cases\" not detailed in the letter of the law. There are five types of permits:\n* A defense permit allows ownership of 2 firearms which must remain at the declared address.\n* A hunting permit requires a hunting license, and allows for up to 6 firearms.\n* A sporting permit requires membership in a registered gun club, and allows up to 6 firearms. It is possible for those under 18 years of age to obtain this permit.\n* A collection permit allows an unlimited number of firearms to be owned, but does not allow the holder to possess ammunition. Collectors must have special security measures which are reviewed by police.\n\nEach of these has limits on type of firearm, and allows for a police-issued permit to buy a specified quantity of appropriate ammunition from a specific gun shop. Transport permits are required to take firearms from the permit-holder's residence to a specified shooting range or hunting ground, and are valid for two years. Transported firearms must be unloaded and not attached to the body.\n\nA self-defense permit allows carrying a firearm for protection against specific human threats. Such permits are valid for one year, but as the police commander can deny applications without stating a reason, they are very rarely issued. Automatic firearms are forbidden for civilian use.\n\nHonduras\n\nGun laws in Honduras are stated in the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material of 2000.\nIn April 2002, the National Arms Registry was formed, requiring all citizens to register their firearms with the Ministry of Defense.\n\nIn 2003, a ban on certain assault rifles was passed, restricting citizens from possessing military-style rifles such as the AK-47 and the M-16.\nIn 2007, an additional decree suspended the right to openly carry a firearm in public, and limited the number of firearms possessed per person.\n\nJamaica\n\nGun laws in Jamaica are stated in the Firearms Act and regulated by the Firearms Licensing Authority.\nApplicants must pass a police background check and complete a certification process to obtain a firearms license for shotguns, handguns and rifles. Shotguns and rifles for hunting or sport-shooting purposes are easier to obtain than handguns. Fully automatic weapons are prohibited. Handguns are limited to those under .45 calibre for revolvers or 10 mm for pistols.  Ammunition purchases are limited to 250 rounds per year for shotguns and 50 for handguns, with applications for additional ammunition generally granted during the hunting season. A gun safe is required for storage of all firearms and ammunition. Once licensed, no additional permit is required to carry a firearm open or concealed, unless the carrying of firearms has been temporarily prohibited under section 22 of the Act.\n\nMexico\n\nUnder the Mexican Constitution, citizens and legal residents have the right to own arms, but may only carry them in accordance with police regulation.\nApplicants must have a clear criminal record and proven income and residence (i.e.: cannot be homeless).\nNew firearms are purchased through the Ministry of Defense. Prohibited weapons include: large-calibre handguns; shotguns with barrels shorter than 25 in or bore greater than 12 gauge; and rifles which are fully automatic or of large calibre. One handgun is permitted for home defense. For hunting and sport shooting, up to nine long guns and one handgun is permitted, requiring membership in a hunting or shooting club. Collectors may be authorized to possess additional and prohibited weapons.\nA carry licence may be issued to those employed by private security firms, or those who may be targets of crime.\n\nPanama\n\nObtaining firearms in Panama requires a Firearms Possession Certificate, which requires a lengthy background check and training. The minimum age to own a firearm is 18 years. A separate permit that allows carrying of a concealed firearm, with all the same requirements, is available to those aged 21 and over. Certain kinds of firearms and ammunition, such as automatic firearms, long guns whose barrels have been shortened, or armor-piercing rounds, are prohibited even for licensed gun owners.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, gun laws are found in a number of federal statutes, enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, and most state constitutions also guarantee this right. There is some variance across the country as both federal and state laws apply to firearm possession and ownership.\n\nPersons are generally prohibited from purchasing a firearm if:[https://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf]  \n* they have been convicted of a felony, or any other crime for which they could have been sentenced to more than a year in prison, or are under indictment for such\n* they are a fugitive from justice\n* they have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n* they are an unlawful user of, or addicted to, controlled substances, including marijuana\n* they have been adjudicated mentally defective\n* they have been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions\n* they have renounced their United States citizenship\n\nThe carrying of weapons, either openly or concealed, is regulated by the states, and these laws have changed rapidly over the past decade.  most states grant licenses to carry handguns on a shall-issue basis to qualified applicants. A few states leave the issuance of carry permits to the discretion of issuing authorities (called may-issue), while eleven states allow the carrying of firearms in a concealed manner without a permit (called Constitutional carry). Twenty-six states allow for open carrying of handguns without a permit while, in general, twenty states require a permit to do so and four states plus Washington D.C. ban open-carry of handguns. There have been legal challenges to concealed-carry laws, with different rulings to their constitutional validity.\n\nAsia\n\nPeople's Republic of China (PRC)\n\nGun ownership in the People's Republic of China (PRC) is strictly regulated by law. Generally, private citizens are not allowed to possess guns. Civilian ownership of guns is largely restricted to authorized, non-individual entities, including sporting organizations, authorized hunting reserves, and wildlife protection, management and research organizations. The chief exception to the general ban on individual firearm ownership is for the purpose of hunting.\nIllegal possession or sale of firearms may result in a minimum punishment of 3 years in prison, and penalties for arms trafficking include life imprisonment.\n\nHong Kong and Macau\n\nIn Hong Kong and Macau, gun ownership is tightly controlled and possession is mainly in the hands of law enforcement, military, and private security firms (providing protection for jewelers and banks). Under Section 13 of Cap 238 Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance of the Hong Kong law, a license is required for unrestricted firearms and ammunition. A license may be issued after a rigorous process to check for criminal records or a history of mental illness. License holders may store other firearms at home in a locked box, but ammunition must be kept at a different premises. Only fully automatic firearms appear prohibited; those found in possession without a licence could be fined HKD$100,000 and face imprisonment for up to 14 years.\n\nEast Timor\n\nUnder East Timorese law, only the military and police forces may possess, carry and use firearms.\n\nIn late June 2008, the Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão, introduced a proposed gun law to Parliament for \"urgent debate\", pushing back scheduled budgetary discussions. The new law, which would allow civilians to own guns, sparked heated debates in the East Timorese parliament. The United Nations, which has a peacekeeping force deployed in the nation, also expressed concerns over the new law.\n\nIndia\n\nGuns in India are strictly regulated by law. The Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules 1962 prohibit the sale, manufacture, possession, acquisition, import, export, and transport of firearms and ammunition unless under a licence, which is difficult to obtain. The Indian Government has a monopoly over the production and sale of firearms, with the exception of some breech-loading smooth-bore shotguns, of which a limited number may be produced and imported. The Arms Act classifies firearms into two categories: Prohibited Bore (PB) and Non-Prohibited Bore (NPB), where all semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms fall under the Prohibited Bore category. The Arms Act of 1962 added to the PB category any firearm which can chamber and fire ammunition of the caliber .303, 7.62 mm, .410, .380, .455, .45 rimless, or 9 mm. Smooth-bore guns having barrels shorter than 20 in are also specified as PB guns.\n\nLicences for acquisition and possession of both PB and NPB firearms could be given by a state government or district magistrate before 1987. From that year, the issuing of licenses for PB firearms became the responsibility of the central government. Licenses are valid for three years and may be renewed. The sale of firearms requires both parties to possess the permit.\n\nThe criteria considered during the issue of NPB firearm permits are whether the applicant faces a threat to their life. PB firearms criteria are more stringent, often for persons in government positions who face immediate danger or threats, those whose occupation involves open threats and danger, and family members of such people. PB licences became more regulated in 2014, when otherwise-eligible persons were frequently rejected on basis of national security grounds.[http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/firearms]  [http://www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/scasia.htm ] [http://disarmament.un.org/cab/salw-nationalreports.html ] Graduate Institute of International Studies, Small Arms Survey 2003: Development Denied, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 59-60; 112. Williams James Arputharaj, Chamila Thushani Hemmathagama and Saradha Nanayakkara, A Comparative Study of Small Arms Legislation in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka: South Asia Partnership (SAP) International, July 2003.Niobe Thompson and Devashish Krishnan, \"Small Arms in India and the Human Costs of Lingering Conflicts\", in Abdel-Fatau Musah and Niobe Thompson, eds., Over a Barrel: Light Weapons and Human Rights in the Commonwealth, London and New Delhi: Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), November 1999, pp. 35-64. Exceptions are made for defence officers who are allowed to keep firearms without licences under the Defence Service rule, and a handful of professional shooters.\n\nThe most common household firearm is a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun (known as DBBL 12 Bore). Other common firearms are .315 bolt-action rifles (magazine capacity of 5 cartridges) and .32 revolvers (capacity of 6 cartridges).\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndonesia has generally strict gun laws. Licences are normally only issued to civilians employed in a profession that involves firearms such as military and law enforcement, with an exception for politicians and businessmen.\n\nApplicants must be a minimum age of 21 years to obtain a firearms licence, and go through a very thorough background check and mental evaluation. They must also state a genuine reason for wanting to own a firearm, which would include hunting, target shooting, collecting, security, and self-defence. All firearms must be registered. Gun permits are valid for five years and may be renewed.\n\nCivilians cannot possess military weapons, but may possess long rifles. Handguns can only be used for sport-shooting and hunting. In 2012 however, it is claimed that the police had been issuing permits to regular citizens.\n\nIsrael\n\nGun laws in Israel are comprehensive despite soldiers being allowed to carry their service weapons on or off duty. Civilians must obtain a firearms licence to lawfully acquire, possess, sell or transfer firearms and ammunition.\n\nOnly a small group of people are eligible for firearms licenses: certain retired military personnel, police officers or prison guards; residents of frontier towns (in the West Bank and the Golan Heights) or those who often work in such towns; and licensed hunters and animal-control officers.  Age requirements vary:  20 or 21 for those who completed military service or civil service equivalent, 27 otherwise, and 45 for non-citizens.  Firearm license applicants must have been a resident of Israel for at least three consecutive years, pass a background check (criminal, health, and mental history), establish a genuine reason for possessing a firearm (such as self-defense, hunting, or sport), and pass a weapons-training course. Around 40% of applications for firearms permits are rejected.\n\nThose holding firearms licenses must renew them and pass a shooting course every three years, and undergo psychological assessment at least once every six years. Security guards must pass these tests to renew their license to carry firearms belonging to their employers. Applicants must demonstrate that they have a safe at their residence in which to keep the firearm. Permits are given only for personal use, and holders for self-defense purposes may own only one handgun and purchase an annual supply of 50 cartridges (although more may be purchased to replace rounds used at a firing range).\n\nIn addition to private licenses of firearms, organizations can issue carry-licenses to their members or employees for activity related to that organization (e.g. security companies, shooting clubs, other workplaces). Members of officially recognized shooting clubs (e.g.: practical shooting, Olympic shooting) are eligible for personal licenses allowing them to possess additional firearms (small bore rifles, handguns, air rifles and air pistols) and ammunition after demonstrating a need and fulfilling minimum membership time and activity requirements. Unlicensed individuals who want to engage in practice shooting are allowed supervised use of handguns at firing ranges.\n\nMost individuals who are licensed to possess handguns may carry them loaded in public, concealed or openly.\n\nIn 2005, there were 237,000 private citizens and 154,000 security guards licensed to carry firearms. Another 34,000 Israelis own guns illegally due to their failure to renew their firearms license. In 2007, there were estimated to be 500,000 licensed small arms held by civilians, in addition to 1,757,500 by the military, and 26,040 by the police.Karp, Aaron. 1 July 2006. \"Trickle and Torrent: State stockpiles\". Small Arms Survey 2006: Unfinished Business; Chapter 2 (Appendix I), p. 61. Oxford: Oxford University Press.Karp, Aaron. 27 August 2007. \"Completing the Count: Civilian firearms – Annexe online\". Small Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City; Chapter 2 (Annexe 4), p. 67 refers. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nJapan\n\nThe weapons law of Japan begins by stating \"No one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords\", and very few exceptions are allowed.\"Law Controlling Possession, Etc. of Fire-Arms and Swords\" (1978), Law No 6, Art 3, EHS Law Bulletin Series, No 3920.\nCitizens are permitted to possess firearms for hunting and sport shooting, but only after submitting to a lengthy licensing procedure.D Bayley, Forces of Order: Police Behavior in Japan and the United States (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), Art 4, 23.\nAfter ten years of shotgun ownership, a licence-holder may apply to obtain a rifle.\n\nKuwait\n\nKuwait has strict firearms laws. Firearms may be licensed to a citizen (or foreigner recommended by the Minister of Interior) who is at least 25 years old and fully capable of handling a weapon, with no criminal record, who is not a suspect or under police surveillance, and who has a source of income.[http://www.moi.gov.kw/portal/varabic/ShowPage.aspx?objectID=792bd90c-076a-443b-84dd-574a8bfd68eb]\nHunting shotguns are the most commonly licensed weapons. Rifles chambered for .22 long rifle are also common, with hunting and sniper rifles more difficult to obtain. Handguns are only allowed for VIPs. Automatic rifles and machine guns are not legally permitted for civilian possession.\n\nLebanon\n\nIn the Lebanese Republic, ownership of any firearm other than handguns, hunting arms and antiques is illegal and only the latter two are permitted to leave the owner's home, making Lebanon one of the most gun-controlled nations in the Middle East. Disregard for this law, however, is prevalent. Lebanon does not officially grant the right to bear arms, but it is a firmly held cultural belief in the country. Firearms licenses are granted to certain individuals, but the test is not open to the public and requires a particular need to be demonstrated.\n\nGun control has been largely unsuccessful in Lebanon due to a historic gun culture, a lack of effective central government control or authority over many parts of the country, and the tumultuous nature of the region. Although gunsmithing was once prominent in the region, it has all but ceased since the mid-1930s, yet it remains legal with a permit. Lebanon has come to be one of the largest arms markets in the Middle East.\n\nLebanon ranks 58th worldwide for privately owned firearms per capita.\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalaysia has strict gun laws. The Arms Act (1960) requires Malaysian citizens to have a license for manufacture, import, export, repair, or ownership of firearms. A firearm license can only be granted by the Chief Police Officer of a state. Discharging a firearm in crimes such as extortion, robbery, resisting arrest and house-breaking is punished by the death penalty. Exhibiting a firearm for any of the scheduled offences (without discharging) carries a penalty of life imprisonment and caning of not less than six strokes. Possession of unlawful firearms carries a sentence of up to fourteen years in prison and caning. While the general public cannot obtain a gun through legal means, a black market for guns does exist.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe North Korea strictly prohibits the use, ownership, manufacture, or distribution of firearms by any citizen not serving in the military or special sectors of the government \"executing official duties\". Anyone in violation of firearms laws are subject to \"stern consequences\".\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan has permissive firearm laws compared to the rest of South Asia, and has the sixth-highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Laws regulate the carrying of weapons in public in most urban areas. Private guns are prohibited in educational institutions, hostels, boarding and lodging houses, fairs, gatherings or processions of a political, religious, ceremonial, or sectarian character, and on the premises of courts of law or public offices. The law in Pakistan does not stipulate that a gun licence should be denied or revoked, and a license permits ownership of any number of weapons including handguns of any size and fully automatic weapons. Gun culture is strong among Pakistanis and a traditionally important part of rural life in its North-Western areas where it is not uncommon to see people legally carrying RPGs and assault rifles.\n\nPhilippines\n\nThe Philippines has generally strict gun laws, though liberal in comparison to other Asia-Pacific countries due to its active gun culture.  Philippine gun control became notorious in 1972 during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos who implemented a near-prohibition of all civilian guns. Current gun laws in the Philippines are outlined from Republic Act 10591, signed in 2013. In order to own a firearm, a citizen must acquire a Possession License. Applicants must be of a minimum age of 21 years and have no history of criminal activity or domestic violence. License-holders may carry handguns in public with the acquisition of a Permit to Carry (PTC), which are granted on a may-issue basis. Applicants must demonstrate a need for a PTC, such as an imminent threat of danger; PTCs are typically granted to lawyers, accountants, media practitioners, cashiers, bank tellers, priests, ministers, rabbis, imams, physicians, nurses, or engineers.\n\nMost Filipinos own firearms for self-protection and target-shooting, which require licenses. Despite the strict laws, gun culture is particularly strong in the Philippines, in part due to the influence of American culture.\n\nSingapore\n\nCitizens in Singapore must obtain a license to lawfully possess firearms or ammunition; applicants must provide justification for the licence, such as target shooting or self-defense. Target-shooting licences permit ownership of a gun, provided it is securely stored in an approved and protected firing range, and is not taken out of the firing range without special permission. Self-defence permits are rarely granted, unless one can justify an 'imminent threat to life that cannot be reasonably removed'. There is no restriction on types of small arms one may own after obtaining a licence.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThe Republic of Korea, known as South Korea, has strict gun policies. Hunting and sporting licenses are issued, but any firearm used in these circumstances must be stored at a local police station. Air rifles also have to be stored at police stations; crossbows and electric shock devices are also classified as firearms but their private retention is permitted. Tasers are prohibited, and possessing a toy gun without an orange tip is strictly prohibited. Violation of firearms law can result in a US$18,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe majority of South Korean men are well-trained in the use of firearms, due to mandatory military service. Despite this, gun culture is notably absent in South Korean society outside of the military, and gun ownership and deaths rank among the lowest in the world.\n\nTaiwan\n\nGun ownership in Taiwan is prohibited to ordinary citizens. There are currently more than 5,000 legal private handgun owners, of which 1,000 are used for self-defense and 4,000 are used for hunting by the Taiwanese aborigines. Gun owners in Taiwan are required to receive regular inspections every two years as well as random inspections by the police.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2009/10/23/229755/Strict-gun.htm\n\nThailand\n\nA firearm license in Thailand is granted only for self-defense, property protection, hunting, or sporting use. A license may not be issued to anyone who is a repeat offender or mentally unstable. Since Oct 2017 citizenship is https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/thailand-amendments-to-firearms-law/ required to purchase and use firearms. A person is also not allowed to carry their gun without an additional permit for concealed carry. Even for Thai citizens permitted to own firearms, firearms are expensive. Fully automatic firearms and explosive devices are prohibited.\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkey is restrictive in terms of gun control statutes. Automatic and semi-automatic firearms are \"prohibited for civilian possession (with no or limited exceptions)\", and for any application, \"an applicant may be asked to produce a medical certificate confirming he or she is capable of handling firearms and that he or she has no psychological – or physical – impediments\". Background checks are mandatory, and a \"genuine reason\" is required for issue of licenses.\n\nCivilians must additionally apply through the police for a handgun carry permit or a rifle carry license (the latter also requiring a hunting license). They must have a special reason prior to application, and the carry licenses are expensive. Special professions like police officers, military personnel, judges, public prosecutors, and senior politicians have their own life-time license from the government, and can apply for free licenses for handgun and rifle carry.\n\nEurope\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina has relatively liberal weapon laws compared to the rest of Europe. Weapons are regulated by the Weapons and Ammunition Law. People over 21 may apply for a permit. Those with a history of criminal activity, mental disorders, alcohol or drug abuse will be denied a permit. There is also a thorough background check, interviewing neighbors and family, and the applicant must complete a course and pass a multiple-choice exam. Police have the last word on the matter, with an appeal possible to a captain of police. Firearms must be kept in a \"safe place\" in a residence, and may be confiscated by police if the owner is found irresponsible. Concealed carry is allowed with a permit. Pepper spray may be carried by females if registered with police.\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn Georgia, civilians above 18 years of age may obtain a firearm permit from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, allowing them to purchase and keep firearms for hunting and sports (pump-action shotguns, hunting rifles, carbines, combined hunting firearms), self-defense (handguns, air guns, sprays, electric tranquilizers) or collections. Permits are denied to persons who are mentally ill, drug addicts, alcoholics, and those who have criminal records.http://police.ge/files/pdf/sakanonmdeblo%20baza/6.Law_on_Arms.pdf\n\nIceland\n\nIn Iceland, a license is required to own or possess firearms. A national government safety course must be passed before applying for a license. A special license is required to own a handgun, which may only be used for target shooting at a licensed range. Semi-automatic firearms have caliber restrictions, while fully automatic firearms are only permitted for collectors.\n\nNorway\n\nFirearms in Norway are regulated by the Firearm Weapons Act,\nwith a new secondary law in effect 1 July 2009 providing more detailed regulation. A firearms licence for rifles or shotguns can be issued by police to \"sober and responsible\" persons 18 years of age or older, with a clean police record, who document a need for the weapon. This may require first obtaining a hunting license or sports-shooting licence. For handguns, the minimum ownership age is 21. The firearms or their vital components must be stored securely in the residence, and the police may make inspections after a 48-hour notice.\n\nRussia\n\nRussian citizens over 18 years of age can obtain a firearms licence after attending gun-safety classes and passing a federal test and background check.  The licence is for five years and may be renewed. Firearms may be acquired for self-defense, hunting, or sports activities. Carrying permits may be issued for hunting firearms licensed for hunting purposes. Initially, purchase is limited to smooth-bore long-barred firearms and pneumatic weapons with a muzzle energy of up to 25 J. After five years of shotgun ownership, rifles may be purchased. Handguns are generally not allowed. Rifles and shotguns with barrels less than 800 mm long are prohibited, as are firearms that shoot in bursts and have more than a 10-cartridge capacity. Suppressors are prohibited. An individual cannot possess more than ten guns (up to five shotguns and up to five rifles) unless they are part of a registered gun collection.\n\nSerbia\n\nSerbia has weapon laws and ranks second in guns per capita with a strong gun culture, especially in rural areas. Weapons are regulated by Weapons and Ammunition Law (Zakon o oružju i municiji).\n\nPeople over age 18 may own firearms with a permit, which is denied to those with a criminal history, mental disorder, or history of alcohol or illegal substance abuse. There is a thorough background check with police having the final decision. Firearms must be stored in a \"safe place\", and may be confiscated by police if the owner is found irresponsible.\n\nRifles, shotguns and handguns may be owned, though licensing for handguns is strict. Concealed carry permits for handguns require proving an imminent threat, with the police making the final decision. There is no limit on the number of firearms owned, though every gun transaction is recorded by the police. There is no rifle caliber restriction (smaller than .50BMG, however). Fully automatic weapons are prohibited. People over 18 years of age can buy and carry stun guns and electric tranquilizers with no permit needed. People over 16 can carry OC sprays.[http://nsp-policija.org.rs/zakon-o-oruzju-i-municiji/] Acquisition of ammunition is unrestricted in terms of the number of rounds, but rounds can be bought only for the caliber in which owned firearm is chambered. Reloading is allowed only to those who have passed an exam in handling explosive materials.\n\nSerbia has its own civilian gun and ammunition industry. Zastava Arms,[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=176]   Prvi Partizan and Krušik export internationally.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGun possession in Switzerland is relatively high compared to most European countries (the rate of Swiss households containing at least one firearm was estimated at 24.45% by the 2016 figures of GunPolicy.org, – lower than Germany, France, and Austria – though including militia-issued firearms). The Swiss have universal conscription for military service. A recent referendum in 2011 on a call to force military weapons to be kept at military sites was defeated. Weapons may voluntarily be kept in the local armory and there is no longer an obligation to keep the weapon at home.\n\nThe Swiss \"Federal Law on Arms, Arms Accessories and Ammunitions\" (WG, LArm) of 20 June 1997 has as its objectives (Article 1) to combat the wrongful use of arms, their accessories, parts and ammunition. It governs the acquisition of arms, their introduction into Swiss territory, export, storage, possession, carrying, transport, and brokerage. It regulates the manufacture and trade in arms, and seeks to prevent the wrongful carrying of ammunition and dangerous objects. Article 3 states that \"The right to acquire, possess and carry arms is guaranteed in the framework of this law\".\n\nUkraine\n\nUkraine is the only European country without firearms statutes; regulation is by Order No. 622 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A firearm license may be issued to citizens who meet an age requirement (21 for shotguns, 18 for shotguns for hunting purposes, and 25 for rifles), have no criminal record or history of domestic violence or mental illness and have a specific reason such as target shooting, hunting or collecting.  Handguns of .22, 9 mm, .357 magnum and .38 caliber are permitted only for target shooting and those who can prove a threat against their lives (who are typically also given concealed carry permits). All firearms must be stored unloaded in a safe.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean Directive  91/477/EC sets minimum standards regarding civilian firearms acquisition and possession that EU Member States must implement into their national legal systems. The Member States are free to adopt more stringent rules, which leads to differences in the extent of legal access to firearms among EU countries., recital.\n\nThe Directive established a series of four categories of firearms (A-B-C-D) in order of decreasing regulation of legal access, with firearms from the first two categories subject to authorization and the third subject to registration. Category C and above require a good cause for possession and a background check for danger posed to themselves, public order and public safety. It also set a minimum age for possession at 18 years across all four categories.\n* Category A (prohibited) includes fully automatic firearms, ammunition with penetrating, explosive or incendiary projectiles, and handgun ammunition with expanding projectiles (except where entitled). Authorization may be possible in special cases.European Firearms Directive, Art. 6\n* Category B (restricted) includes semi-automatic or repeating short firearms, single-shot short centerfire firearms, single-shot rimfire firearms less than 28 cm overall, semi-automatic long firearms with greater than 3-round capacity (including the chamber) (or which can be converted to such), repeating and semi-automatic long firearms with smoothbore barrels less than 60 cm long, and semi-automatic firearms which resemble fully automatic weapons.European Firearms Directive, Art. 5\n* Category C (declared) includes semi-automatic firearms, repeating long firearms, and long rifle-barreled firearms not covered in Category B, and single-shot short rimfire firearms not less than 28 cm overall.\n* Category D (other) includes single-shot long firearms with smooth-bore barrels.\n\nAustria\n\nIn Austria, firearms are registered by licensed dealers or gunsmiths within 6 weeks of purchase by a citizen aged 18 or over, after completing a background check. Break-action and repeating rifles and break-action shotguns can be purchased without restriction. Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns (non-pump action) require a firearm license or a concealed-carry permit, and must be stored securely. Fully automatic weapons, some military-style semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and shotguns with barrels shorter than 45 cm or 90 cm overall are restricted, with licenses rarely issued.\n\nAntique weapons made before 1871 require no license or registration. Ammunition sales are generally unrestricted, though a permit is required for handgun ammunition and some rifle ammunition.\n\nCyprus\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus has strict gun control. Private citizens are completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any calibre, including .22 rimfire.  Shotguns limited to two rounds are allowed with a licence, issued by provincial police. Shotguns must be for hunting purposes, and a licensed citizen may own up to ten shotguns, typically double-barrelled. A firearm licence is required to buy ammunition, of up to 250 shells per purchase, with sales recorded.  Cyprus also controls airguns, and airgun owners require a licence.Grupp, Larry (2011). The Worldwide Gun Owner's Guide. Scottsdale, Arizona: Bloomfield Press, 365pp.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nThe Czech Republic is unusual in that the vast majority of gun owners (240,000 out of 300,000) possess their firearms for purposes of self-defense. Furthermore, Czech Republic has a shall-issue concealed carry permit system, whereby every self-defense license holder may carry up to two concealed firearms ready for immediate self-defense. This gives Czech Republic a higher rate of concealed carry weapons per capita than the US (by 2010 data) despite much lower gun-ownership rates.\n\nGun licenses may be obtained by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Though general firearms ownership rate remains relatively low, the ability to possess and carry firearms in general is understood as a basic freedom. This stems from historical experience of firearm bans under Nazi and Communist dictatorships.\n\nCrime with legally owned firearms is rare, with 45 recorded incidents in 2016, 17 of which were \"dangerous threats\" (compared to the total number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms). Gun laws had not been an issue until the EU Directive (see above), which led to the proposal of securing Czech citizens' gun rights through adoption of a constitutional amendment that would make firearms possession in the country a national security issue, thus taking it outside the scope of EU law. However, this provision was not approved by the Senate of the Czech Parliament, and therefore didn't become law, as constitutional laws need to be approved by senate in order to pass.\n\nDenmark\n\nCivilians in Denmark aged 16 and above can acquire gun licenses for hunting or sport shooting. This requires passing a written multiple-choice test and a practical test, after which the police determines if the applicant is suitable to own a weapon. A license is usually provided if the applicant has no or only minor marks on their criminal record.\n\nA hunting license permits the over-the-counter-purchase and ownership of an unlimited number of shotguns of up to 12 gauge and 2-round capacity; licenses to purchase rifles are issued on a case-by-case basis, but in general, there is no limit on the number or type of bolt-action rifles. Semi-automatic rifles are allowed if the rifle is limited to 2 rounds (hunting in Denmark), or without limitation on capacity (hunting outside of Denmark). Currently, only larger calibres (.308, 6,5x55, .300wm etc) are issued as semi-auto rifles for hunting abroad. .223/5.56x45 and similar caliber rifles are generally not approved.\nThe hunter must pass a shotgun or rifle shooting test before being allowed to hunt.\n\nFor sport-shooting purposes, shotguns can be used as well, as can bolt-action rifles of almost any caliber (.50bmg as one of the exceptions). Sporting rifles are often chambered in 22lr and 6.5 x 55 mm.\nSemi-automatic rifles are not allowed for sports shooting.\n\nHandgun: After two years of active membership in a shooting club, one can apply for a handgun permit which is then subject for background check and approval by the police, and one has to be 20 years old.\nApproved calibers:  All calibers under 9mm (9x19, 38 Spl, 357 magnum, .32acp etc), plus a limited number of larger calibers; .40sw, 45 ACP, 44 Spl.\nThe max number of handguns are 6 in 22 cal.\nWhen applying for gun number 3 it requires a special permit from the department of justice. Large caliber guns, bigger than 22 cal, are restricted to a maximum of 2 in the same caliber. Meaning one can only at a given time own 2 handguns in 9 mm. However, it is at the same time legal to own additional 2 handguns in 9 mm, if they are revolvers.\nFor all handguns, regardless of caliber, the overall length must be at least 210 millimeters (8.2677 inch), measured without orthopedic grip and removal parts.\n\nA weapon permit for sporting purposes (both long and short firearms) has to be renewed every 5 years. Rifle permits for hunting rifles has to be renewed every 10 years. Shotguns are not on individual permits, and you are allowed to own these as long as you have a valid hunting license - and you can keep them for up to 10 years after your hunting license expires - however you are not allowed to keep ammunition without a valid license.\n\nCarrying a firearm in public is strictly prohibited, however, proportional self defence is allowed. This means, that if you are attacked with a firearm, you are legally allowed to defend yourself proportionally - eg. with a firearm of your own.\n\nFully automatic weapons are prohibited for civilian use, unless a special permit is issued by the Ministry of Justice. These permits are extremely rare, and are normally only issued to people or companies working for, or supplying the Police or Military.\n\nIllegal possession of a firearm may be punished with imprisonment of no less than one year. Civilians may keep privately owned weapons, including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles at their residence.https://www.politi.dk/da/borgerservice/vaabentilladelse/blankvaaben.htm These and ammunition have to be stored in a approved gun cabinet (EN1143-1 grade 0 or better).https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=158805  §22 The police may inspect a shooting club's weapons at their discretion, but require a court order to inspect privately held firearms.[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/v%C3%A5ben/lovgivning Ministry of Justice – Weapons]\n\nFinland\n\nThe ownership and use of firearms in Finland is regulated by the country's Firearms Act of 1998. Weapons are individually licensed by local police, with no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use. No type of weapon is explicitly prohibited, but licences are granted only for a reason. In general, this excludes all but hunting and sports guns from non-professional use. Fully automatic weapons are generally not permitted. With the exception of law enforcement, only specially trained security guards may carry loaded weapons in public.\n\nIn November 2007, Finland updated their gun laws to comply with the EU directive by removing the ability of 15- to 18-year-olds to have their own permit, but a possibility to a have dual-license to an already licensed weapon with permission of the license holder remains in that age group. In 2011, a constitutional law committee concluded that people over the age of 20 can receive a permit for semi-automatic handguns; individuals must demonstrate continuous activity in handgun sporting for two years before they can have a license to possess their own handgun.\n\nFrance\n\nIn France, a hunting licence or a shooting sport license is needed to purchase a firearm. In September 2015, firearms were divided into four categories that determine the regulations that apply to their possession and use. Category C firearms can be obtained with a hunting licence or affiliation with a shooting range, and a medical certificate. Category B firearms additionally require completing at least three shooting sessions with an instructor.\n\nA person cannot own more than 12 centerfire firearms, and cannot own more than 10 magazines and 1,000 rounds of ammunition per firearm. A one-year carry license may be issued for persons \"exposed to exceptional risks to their life\" allowing to carry a handgun and a maximum of 50 rounds.  Such authorizations are extremely rare, as the state would provide police protection.  Since November 2015, police officers have been allowed to carry their firearms while off-duty.\n\nGermany\n\nGun ownership in Germany is restrictive, regulated by the Federal Weapons Act (German: Waffengesetz) of 1972.\nThe laws apply to weapons with a fire energy exceeding . A firearms licence may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, who are deemed reliable and can prove a necessity for owning a firearm. A separate license is required for each firearm owned. Target-shooters must have been a member of a shooting club with 18 recorded visits in the previous 12 months. A firearms carry permit is a second-tier license which allows concealed carry in public, and is only issued to those with a particular need.\n\nSeveral weapons and special ammunitions are completely prohibited, such as automatic firearms. Buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading of these weapons is illegal and punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the weapon and a fine of up to €10,000. Using an illegal weapon for crime of any kind is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nGermany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms legally owned by 1.4 million people.\n\nGreece\n\nGreece has strict gun control. Shotguns (limited to 3-round capacity) rifles and handguns are allowed, and these require a licence issued by provincial police. To purchase handguns and rifles, citizens must either have a concealed-carry permit or a target-shooting permit (for rifles). Semi auto rifles are prohibited. Hunters can own up to 10 shotguns and sport shooters can own up to 7 guns, and there is no license-check or record kept for ammunition purchases for shotguns but target shooters can only own 500 rounds per weapon.\n\nHungary\n\nGun law in Hungary is relatively strict, regulated by Law 24/2004 and Law revision 13/2012. Permission of the police, passing a psychological test (in some cases) and membership in a hunting or rifle club is required in order to own semi-automatic rifles, hunting rifles, shotguns or handguns.  Automatic rifles are prohibited.\n\nIn 2010, there were 129,000 registered gun owners (1.3% of the population) in Hungary with 235,000 firearms. The majority of these were hunting rifles and handguns for self-defense. Gun violence is very rare in Hungary; police use lethal weapons fewer than 10 times in a year, on average.\n\nIreland\n\nGun laws in Ireland are strict, requiring all firearms to be licensed individually through the Gardaí (police). Applicants must be 16 years of age and have a good reason for ownership, a secure location to store firearms, proof of competency with the firearm or arrangements to achieve such, provide access to medical records and two character references, and be of sound mind and temperate habits. Applicants convicted of certain specified offenses will be denied a firearms certificate. Personal protection is not a valid reason for ownership.\n\nIrish firearms law is based on the Firearms Act 1925, which was amended by several following acts in 1964, 1968, 1971, 1990, 1998 and 2000. The cumulative effect of these modifications, along with modifications in other acts and confusion over which amendments applied, resulted in a 2006 Irish Law Reform Commission recommendation that all extant legislation be restated (written in a single document with all prior Acts repealed).  However, the Criminal Justice Act 2006, contained a rewriting almost 80% of the Firearms Act. It was quickly followed by amendments in 2007 and further major amendments in 2009, exacerbating the legislative confusion.  the Law Reform Commission recommendation has not as yet been fully enacted; the Firearms Act consists of the initial 1925 Act amended by approximately twenty separate Acts and is well understood by only a handful of those directly involved in its drafting, amendment or usage. Extensive complaints have arisen over the application of the legislation, with several hundred judicial review cases won in the High Court and Supreme Court by firearms owners, all relating to licensing decisions which had not adhered to the Firearms Act.\n\nItaly\n\nIn Italy, national police issue gun licenses to those over the age of 18 without criminal records, who are not mentally ill or known substance abusers, who can prove competence with firearm safety.  A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a \"valid reason\" to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, six sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890). These limits can be exceeded with a collector license.\n\nPrivate firearms must be registered at the local police department within 72 hours of acquisition. Ammunition purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds of handgun ammunition and 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition.\n\nNetherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands, gun ownership is restricted to law enforcement, hunters, and target shooters (self-defense is not a valid reason to own firearms). A hunting license requires passing a hunters safety course. To own a gun for target shooting, the applicant must have been a member of a shooting club for a year. People with felonies, drug addictions, and mental illnesses may not possess firearms.\n\nOnce obtained, firearms must be stored in a safe and annually inspected by police. Firearms may only be used in self-defense as a matter of \"equal force\". Fully automatic firearms are banned, but there are otherwise few restrictions: semi-automatics, handguns, and magazines of all sizes are legal, as are all types of ammunition. A licensed gun owner may only have five firearms registered to his or her license at one time.[https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands Radio Netherlands Worldwide]\n\nPoland\n\nGun ownership in Poland is regulated by the Weapons and Munitions Act of 21 May 1999, as further amended,[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU19990530549/T/D19990549L.pdf Weapons and Munitions Act, full text] which requires a license to own and possess firearms. As a result of very strict controls in the past, gun ownership in Poland is the lowest in the EU, at 1 firearm per 100 citizens. However, the gun laws were relaxed in 2011 and again in 2014. Also year by year amount of permits given grows. This, in general, removed the police discretionary power to refuse a license without explanation.\nThe current law states that target shooting and collecting permits are shall issue and self-defense one is may issue.\n\nTo obtain a firearms license, the applicant must have no criminal record, undertake a medical and psychological evaluation and pass an exam appropriate to their reason for wanting a firearm (held by the police for self-defense, the Polish Sports Shooting Association for target shooting, or the Polish Hunting Association for hunting). Permits are issued indefinitely, although self-defense ones require passing medical and psychological evaluation every 5 years.\n\nEach permit specifies types and number of weapons the holder can own. These values vary greatly depending on license type and documented needs, but it's an established practice to receive around 5 slots for target shooting and hunting and 10 slots for collecting. A target-shooting license requires the applicant to possess a valid shooting competition license (by taking part in 2 to 4 ISSF-regulated shooting competitions per year for each category of firearm owned: handgun, rifle and shotgun), and allows carrying a loaded concealed firearm in public. A collecting license allows to obtain and use (in shooting range) any type of unstationary weapon including selective fire and fully automatic firearms. A self-defense license requires proving a \"constant, substantial and higher than average\" danger. There are separate, lifelong permits for high-ranking ex-military and police officers, generally allowing them to own one handgun. Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies.\n\nReplicas of black powder firearms designed before 1885 require no licence to own, and are therefore quite popular in the shooting community.\n\nRomania\n\nGun ownership in Romania is regulated by [http://legeaz.net/legea-295-2004-armelor-munitiilor/ Law 295/2004]. Romania has one of the toughest gun ownership laws in the world. In order for citizens to obtain a weapon, they must obtain a permit from the police, and must register their weapon once they purchase it. There are several categories of permits, with different requirements and rights, including hunting permits, self-defense permits, sports shooting permits and collectors permits. The only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits, magistrates, MPs, military forces and certain categories of diplomats. A psychological evaluation is required beforehand in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, knives with a blade longer than 15 cm are considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms.\n\nIn order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license, he must spend a certain \"practice time\" with a professional hunter. To obtain a self-defense permit, one must be under witness protection. Sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors' association, respectively.\n\nThe amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type. Sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun; Collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition.\n\nExplosive weapons and ammunitions, fully automatic weapons, weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object, armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited\n\nThe type of gun is also regulated by permit. Below is a shortened version of the table detailing the restrictions by type of lethal weapon and permit, for civilian owners. Note that for collectors, short weapons designed after 1945 are forbidden, while only non-lethal weapons are allowed for self-defense permits.\n\nIt is illegal to use or carry weapons with a muzzle velocity of over 10kJ if \"the barrel is fitted with devices conceived or adapted to reduce recoil\"\n\nNote that there are other restrictions for obtaining weapons under a sports-shooting license.\n\nMinors (14 and older) may also use a weapon, provided that they are under the supervision of someone who has a gun license. However, they cannot own or carry one until the age of 18.\n\nThe use of guns for self-defense is only allowed if the gun is a last resort option.\n\nSlovakia\n\nGun ownership in Slovakia is regulated principally by law 190/2003. \nA firearms license may be issued to an applicant at least 21 years of age, with no criminal history, and of sound health and mind, who passes an oral exam covering aspects of gun law, safe handling, and first aid. Licenses are issued in 6 categories: (A) concealed carry for self-defense, (B) home self-defense, (C) possession for work purposes, (D) long guns for hunting, (E) possession for sport shooting, and (F) collecting. A concealed carry license is only issued if the police deem a sufficient justification; about 2% of the adult population holds this license.\n\nThere is an exception for non-repeating muzzle-loaded firearms, which may be purchased without a license.\n\nSlovenia\n\nGun ownership in Slovenia is regulated under the \"Weapons Law\" (Zakon o orožju) which is harmonised with the directives of the EU. Gun permits are issued to applicants at least 18 years old, reliable, without criminal history and who has not been a conscientious objector, who passes a medical exam and a test on firearm safety. A specific reason must be given for gun ownership: for hunting or target shooting, the applicant must provide proof of membership in a hunting or sports shooting organization; for collection, the applicant must arrange safe storage with a level of security dependent on the type of weapons; for self-defence, the applicant must prove a risk to personal safety to such an extent that a weapon is needed.\n\nAs in most EU member states, the ownership of Category A firearms is prohibited; however these can be owned by weapon collectors, providing that requirements are met. Firearms must be stored in a locked cabinet with ammunition stored separately. Concealed carry is allowed in special circumstances. A gun permit is also required for airguns with muzzle velocity greater than 200 m/s or energy of 20 J.\n\nSpain\n\nFirearm regulation in Spain is restrictive, enacted in Real Decreto 137/1993. A firearm license may be obtained from the Guardia Civil after passing a police background check, a physiological and medical test, and a practical and theoretical exam. Shotgun and rifle licenses must be renewed after 5 years, subject to firearm inspection.  Sporting licences must be renewed after 3 years.  Police may inspect firearms at any time. A self-defence and concealed carry license must be renewed every year, and is only available under special conditions.\n\nA license-holder may own up to 6 rimfire rifles and 6 shotguns, and as many centerfire rifles as they can securely store. With a sporting licence, valid for 3 years, 1 to 10 handguns may be owned, depending on sports-shooting level. Magazine capacity for semi-automatic centerfire rifles is limited to 4 rounds for sports shooting and 2 rounds for hunting; semi-automatic shotguns are limited to 2 rounds. Rimfire rifles, regardless of type have no magazine limit. Rifles chambered for certain \"war calibres\"  are prohibited, such as .223/5.56 NATO and .50 cal. and Winchester 308 and 7.68x39 (AK round) is only permitted in bolt-action or single-shot weapons. Proof of ownership of an approved safe is required for all centerfire rifles and handguns, and the owner is responsible for firearm thefts. Ammunition must be stored separately. Rifle and handgun ammunition may only be possessed for legally owned weapons, and purchases and possession is limited to 200 rounds rifle and 100 rounds for handguns. In addition, there are yearly limits in quantity; however additional quantities can be petitioned. For shotgun Ammunition adults with a valid ID can purchase/possess up to 5,000 shells and there are no yearly limits in quantity. Licence-holders are only allowed to transport their unloaded firearms from their residence to the shooting range or hunting field and back, with no detours. Firearms may only be discharged at approved shooting ranges or hunting grounds (in season).\n\nThere are firearm license for private security for handguns and rifles. These cannot be used outside of work and must be stored in the workplace premises (with approved safe).\n\nIn addition there are handgun license for self-defense in concealed carry. However, this is granted on a \"may issue\" basis with several standards of necessity to be met and very few are granted. This license must be renued annually and is not automatic.\n\nMembers of police forces and officers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces have a special firearms licence which encompasses all of the others. There are additional licenses for collectors and muzzle-loading firearms. English summary from the U.S. Law Library of Congress\n\nSweden\n\nGun ownership in Sweden is regulated by Vapenlagen 1996:67 (literally, The Weapon Law),\nmodified by weapon decree Vapenförordningen 1996:70\nand FAP 551-3 / RPSFS 2009:13. The police issue licenses to persons in good standing who have passed a hunting examination or belonged to an approved shooting club for six months. License-holders are usually 18 years or older, and may lend a weapon to a person at least 15 years of age for supervised use.\n\nA license-holder may own up to six hunting rifles, ten handguns, or a mix of eight rifles and handguns. Firearms must be stored in an approved safe. A firearm registered for sport shooting may not be used for hunting. A concealed carry permit can be obtained under very special circumstances, such as a proven threat to life.\n\nFirearm collectors must have a clearly stated demarcation of their interest in collecting (e.g.: pre-World War II British handguns). The police may demand security measures on keeping the collection. Collectors may request a time-limited permit to discharge their weapons. Firearms manufactured before 1890 and not using sealed cartridges are exempt from the weapon law.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK increased firearm regulation through several Firearms Acts,\nleading to an outright ban on automatic firearms and most self-loading firearms. Breech-loading handguns are also tightly controlled.\nFirearm ownership usually requires a police-issued Shotgun Certificate (SGC) or Firearm Certificate (FAC). The applicant must have: no criminal convictions; no history of medical condition including alcohol and drug-related conditions; no history of depression, mental or nervous disorder, or epilepsy; and a secure gun safe to store firearms. The FAC additionally requires demonstrating a good reason for each firearm the applicant wishes to own (such as hunting, pest control, collecting, or target shooting). Self-defence is only accepted as a good reason in Northern Ireland.\n\nAn SGC allows the holder to purchase and own any number of shotguns, so long as they can be securely stored. Shotgun magazine capacity is limited to two rounds. For weapons covered under an FAC, police may restrict the type and amount of ammunition held, and where and how the firearms are used. Aside from Northern Ireland, private ownership of most handguns was banned in 1997.\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia\n\nGun laws in Australia are under the jurisdiction of the state governments, which collectively agreed to reforms in the 1996 National Firearms Agreement. The states issue firearms licenses for hunting or sport shooting. Licenses are widely prohibited for convicted offenders and those with a history of mental illness. Licenses must be renewed every 1 or 5 years (or 10 years in the Northern Territory). Licence-holders must be 18 years or age; minor's permits allow using a firearm under adult supervision by those as young as 12.\n\nHandguns may be obtained by target shooters and certain security guards after serving a probationary six-month period with a shooting club. Restricted weapons include military weapons, high-capacity semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns holding more than 5 rounds.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72622.html Arms Act 1983], legislation.govt.nz\nArms Amendment Act 1992,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0095/latest/DLM278351.html Arms Amendment Act 1992], legislation.govt.nz\nand Arms Regulations 1992,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0346/latest/DLM168889.html Arms Regulations 1992], legislation.govt.nz\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms licence may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms licence being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/your-duties-and-legal-requirements \"Arms Code Section 5: Your duties and legal requirements\"], NZ Police\nwhich specifically excludes self-defence.[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing \"The law does not permit the possession of firearms 'in anticipation' that a firearm may need to be used in self-defence.\"] NZ Police\n\nOwnership of certain types of firearms require stricter vetting procedures, a higher level of storage security, and a \"special reason\" for obtaining the weapon. The applicant must gain an appropriate endorsement on their licence and a permit to procure before obtaining handguns, machine guns, selective-fire assault rifles, and military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) (including those with magazine capacity of more than 15 rounds of rimfire or 7 rounds of centerfire).\n\nComparison \n\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNotes:\nShall issue – subject to fulfillment of legal conditions, the authorities may not deny license and/or firearm(s)\nMay issue – the authorities have final say in whether a person may obtain a license and/or firearm(s)\n:May issue – Specific reason needed – a specific reason must be proven in order to obtain license, i.e. specific threat to life for concealed carry or firearms collecting for fully automatic firearm\n:May issue – restricted – although the law provides for possibility of obtaining necessary licenses and permits, in reality, these are rarely or almost never issued\nPrivate citizens – it is possible for a private citizen to legally acquire a gun (usually for hunting, sport shooting and often also for collecting)\nPersonal protection – personal protection or self-defence is a legitimate reason to own a firearm (or citizens are not legally required to establish a genuine reason)\nOpen carry – a private citizen may carry a loaded firearm openly for immediate self-defense in public (for example, with a special permit)\nConcealed carry – a private citizen may carry a concealed firearm for self-defense (for example, with a special permit)\nCarry without permit – a private citizen may carry a loaded firearm for immediate self-defense in public without any special permit\nFully automatic firearms – fully automatic firearms are allowed for civilians (for example, with a special permit); automatic weapons don't need to be permanently disabled\nUnlimited magazine – no limits on magazine capacity\nFree of checks – medical or background checks are not required (\"yes\" means \"not required\")\nFree of registration – firearms are not required to be registered – no \"illegal possession\" law (\"yes\" means \"not required\")\nMax penalty – maximum penalty for simple illicit firearm possession (no intent to commit crime with firearm), years in prison",

    "aggregatedText" : "Gun laws and policies (collectively referred to as firearms regulation or gun control) regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians. Many countries have restrictive firearm policies, while a few have permissive ones.[http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/193/firearm_regulation_-_guiding_policy/3,212,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,16,17,18,19,22,26,27,28,217,29,30,218,31,33,38,39,40,41,43,44,221,45,46,47,48,49,50,222,52,56,57,58,60,61,62,225,64,65,66,227,69,71,72,231,73,74,75,77,78,79,81,82,83,86,90,91,94,95,233,99,100,102,234,104,105,107,108,110,111,112,236,237,238,240,113,114,116,241,118,242,121,122,123,125,128,129,131,132,275,136,137,139,140,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,150,244,152,153,154,155,158,159,162,163,247,164,166,170,172,174,249,250,251,175,252,177,180,182,183,54,254,184,185,186,187,256,188,189,190,192,194,195,197,199,200,201,257,258,204,205,206 GunPolicy.org – Facts]. The only countries with permissive gun legislation are: Albania, Austria, Chad, Republic of Congo, Honduras, Micronesia, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Tanzania, the United States, Yemen and Zambia. Accessed on August 27, 2016.\nCountries with a strong gun culture may afford civilians a right to keep and bear arms, and have more-liberal gun laws than neighboring jurisdictions.\nCountries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for hunting, sport shooting ( target shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed carry, with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed (such as handguns and other short-barreled weapons).  Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licences may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of domestic violence, alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm licence may have to demonstrate competence by completing a gun-safety course and show provision for a secure location to store weapons.\n\nGuns laws are considered permissive in countries where the authorities will provide a firearm license on a shall issue basis to ordinary citizens who meet the legal requirements.  Guns laws are restrictive when licenses are provided on a may issue basis, at the discretion of the regulating authority, often requiring the applicant to demonstrate a reason why they need a firearm.  Gun laws are considered strict when it is difficult or impossible for an ordinary citizen to obtain a firearm through legal means.\n\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, electroshock weapons, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably high-capacity magazines and sound suppressors.  There may be restrictions on the quantity or types of ammunition purchased, with certain types prohibited. Due to the global scope of this article, detailed coverage cannot be provided on all these matters; the article will instead attempt to briefly summarize each country's weapon laws in regard to small arms use and ownership by civilians.\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons was adopted in Bamako, Mali, on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the 51 member states of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries.\n\nKenya\n\nGun law in Kenya is specified in the Firearms Act (Cap. 114) Laws of Kenya. The Chief Licensing Officer (CLO) has discretion to award, deny, or revoke firearms licenses. Applicants must be 21 years of age or older, pass a stringent background check for criminal activity, mental health and domestic violence, and state genuine reason(s) for their need to privately own and carry a firearm. Checks are regularly repeated, with failure to pass resulting in immediate revocation of the licence. Once licensed to own a gun, no additional permit is required to carry a concealed firearm.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, Firearms Control Act 60 (enacted in 2000) regulates the ownership of firearms by civilians. Ownership of a firearm is conditional on a competency test and several other factors, including a background check of the applicant, inspection of an applicant's premises, and, since July 2004, licensing of the weapon by the police. There are several different firearms licences, allowing different types of weapons for different purposes. Handguns and carrying in public is legal under all licence types with no additional permit.\n\nThe only prohibited small arms are burst-fire and fully automatic firearms, and firearms which have been modified in bore or barrel length without permission.\n\nAmericas\n\nArgentina\n\nFirearms in Argentina are restrictive, and regulated by ANMaC (Agencia Nacional de Materiales Controlados) since late October, 2015 when said agency replaced RENAR (Registro Nacional de Armas de la Republica Argentina), both being a branch of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. To own a firearm in Argentina, one must be a legitimate user. Applicants must: be 21 years of age or older, provide a medical certificate that certifies they are physically and mentally fit, complete a safety course, provide a legitimate mean of income, undergo and pass a background check. A successful applicant is fingerprinted and issued a license which has to be renewed every five years. One may not legally fire a firearm in Argentina if they are not a legitimate user, even if that gun belongs to someone else. Once a legitimate user wants to purchase a firearm, they must provide a secure location to store the firearm(s), and give an acceptable reason for wanting a firearm – such as collecting, target shooting, hunting, business, or self-defense in the home.\n\nFirearms must be purchased through a licensed dealer and registered with ANMaC. If a firearm is inherited, a re-registering form must be filed. There is no limit on the number of firearms owned so long as they are properly stored. Ammunition sales are recorded but unlimited.\n\nCarry permits for licensed handgun owners are extremely difficult to obtain, and require appearing before the ANMaC board to make their case. Carry permits are renewed yearly to re-examine their \"clear and present\" danger, and the permit is usually revoked immediately if this danger is removed. Those dealing in money or valuables or in private security may be issued a business carry permit.\n\nHandguns above .32 calibre are conditional-use; fully automatic handguns are prohibited to civilians. Bolt-action rifles above .22 Long Rifle and semi-automatic rifles above .22 Long Rifle with a non-detachable magazine are conditional-use; fully automatic rifles and semi-automatic rifles above .22 Long Rifle with detachable magazines are prohibited.  Semi-automatic shotguns and shotguns with barrels between 380 and long are conditional use; fully automatic shotguns and shotguns with barrels under 380 mm are prohibited.\n\nBrazil\n\nAll firearms in Brazil are required to be registered. The minimum age for ownership is 25,\nand certificates of aptitude and mental health are required prior to the acquisition of a firearm and every three years thereafter.\nIt is generally illegal to carry a firearm outside a residence.\nExecutive Order  5.123, of 1 July 2004 \nallows the Federal Police to confiscate firearms which are not possessed for a valid reason; self-defense is not considered a valid argument.https://jus.com.br/artigos/30201/a-ilegalidade-na-negativa-a-compra-de-arma-de-fogo\n\nThe total number of firearms in Brazil is thought to be between 14 million and 17 million \nwith an estimated 9 million being unregistered. \nIn a 2005 referendum, Brazilians voted against a government proposal for a total ban on the sales of firearms to private citizens.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada's firearm laws are stated in the Firearms Act. The possession and acquisition licence (PAL) is distributed by the RCMP (federal police) and requires taking a firearms safety course and passing a test, a background check, and reference interviews. The PAL allows purchase of most popular sporting rifles and shotguns. A Restricted-PAL (RPAL) has an additional course for restricted weapons, which have increased storage requirements.\nThe two main reasons for owning firearms are target shooting and hunting. Carrying firearms for self-defense against human threats is prohibited, but a \"wilderness carry permit\" can be obtained for protection against wild animals.\n\nThere is an authorization to transport (ATT) requirement for restricted and prohibited weapons, which must be registered. Non-citizens may obtain a non-resident firearms declaration from a customs officer, for a temporary 60-day authorization to bring a non-prohibited firearm into Canada.\n\nIn Canada, firearms fall into one of three categories:\n# Non-Restricted: Long guns with an overall length greater than 26 in and semi-automatics with a barrel longer than . These can be possessed with an ordinary PAL, and are the only class of firearms which can be used for hunting.\n# Restricted: This includes handguns with barrel lengths greater than 4.1 inches (105 mm), and long guns which do not meet the length requirements for non-restricted but are not prohibited. These guns require ATTs, so can only be discharged at ranges.\n# Prohibited: These weapons generally cannot be possessed by civilians, and include fully automatic weapons and many military arms, and handguns with barrel length equal to or shorter than 4.1 inches (105 mm), and those chambered for .25 and .32 cartridges. Normally, the only way to possess these is by being grandfathered in or through inheritance. Most magazines for semi-automatic long guns capable of holding more than 5 centerfire cartridges or 10 rounds for handguns are prohibited.\n\nChile\n\nIn Chile, the 92nd article of the Constitution declares gun ownership as a privilege granted in accordance to a special law. Firearms are regulated by the police. Civilian gun ownership is allowed by law but discouraged by authorities, with regular press statements and campaigns denouncing the dangers of private firearms.\n\nPolice-issued firearm permits require applicants to be 18 years of age, provide a mental health certificate issued by a psychiatrist, have a clean criminal record with no domestic violence accusations, and pass a written test on firearm safety and knowledge. Final approval is in the hands of the police commander of the district, who can deny the permit in \"justified cases\" not detailed in the letter of the law. There are five types of permits:\n* A defense permit allows ownership of 2 firearms which must remain at the declared address.\n* A hunting permit requires a hunting license, and allows for up to 6 firearms.\n* A sporting permit requires membership in a registered gun club, and allows up to 6 firearms. It is possible for those under 18 years of age to obtain this permit.\n* A collection permit allows an unlimited number of firearms to be owned, but does not allow the holder to possess ammunition. Collectors must have special security measures which are reviewed by police.\n\nEach of these has limits on type of firearm, and allows for a police-issued permit to buy a specified quantity of appropriate ammunition from a specific gun shop. Transport permits are required to take firearms from the permit-holder's residence to a specified shooting range or hunting ground, and are valid for two years. Transported firearms must be unloaded and not attached to the body.\n\nA self-defense permit allows carrying a firearm for protection against specific human threats. Such permits are valid for one year, but as the police commander can deny applications without stating a reason, they are very rarely issued. Automatic firearms are forbidden for civilian use.\n\nHonduras\n\nGun laws in Honduras are stated in the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material of 2000.\nIn April 2002, the National Arms Registry was formed, requiring all citizens to register their firearms with the Ministry of Defense.\n\nIn 2003, a ban on certain assault rifles was passed, restricting citizens from possessing military-style rifles such as the AK-47 and the M-16.\nIn 2007, an additional decree suspended the right to openly carry a firearm in public, and limited the number of firearms possessed per person.\n\nJamaica\n\nGun laws in Jamaica are stated in the Firearms Act and regulated by the Firearms Licensing Authority.\nApplicants must pass a police background check and complete a certification process to obtain a firearms license for shotguns, handguns and rifles. Shotguns and rifles for hunting or sport-shooting purposes are easier to obtain than handguns. Fully automatic weapons are prohibited. Handguns are limited to those under .45 calibre for revolvers or 10 mm for pistols.  Ammunition purchases are limited to 250 rounds per year for shotguns and 50 for handguns, with applications for additional ammunition generally granted during the hunting season. A gun safe is required for storage of all firearms and ammunition. Once licensed, no additional permit is required to carry a firearm open or concealed, unless the carrying of firearms has been temporarily prohibited under section 22 of the Act.\n\nMexico\n\nUnder the Mexican Constitution, citizens and legal residents have the right to own arms, but may only carry them in accordance with police regulation.\nApplicants must have a clear criminal record and proven income and residence (i.e.: cannot be homeless).\nNew firearms are purchased through the Ministry of Defense. Prohibited weapons include: large-calibre handguns; shotguns with barrels shorter than 25 in or bore greater than 12 gauge; and rifles which are fully automatic or of large calibre. One handgun is permitted for home defense. For hunting and sport shooting, up to nine long guns and one handgun is permitted, requiring membership in a hunting or shooting club. Collectors may be authorized to possess additional and prohibited weapons.\nA carry licence may be issued to those employed by private security firms, or those who may be targets of crime.\n\nPanama\n\nObtaining firearms in Panama requires a Firearms Possession Certificate, which requires a lengthy background check and training. The minimum age to own a firearm is 18 years. A separate permit that allows carrying of a concealed firearm, with all the same requirements, is available to those aged 21 and over. Certain kinds of firearms and ammunition, such as automatic firearms, long guns whose barrels have been shortened, or armor-piercing rounds, are prohibited even for licensed gun owners.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, gun laws are found in a number of federal statutes, enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, and most state constitutions also guarantee this right. There is some variance across the country as both federal and state laws apply to firearm possession and ownership.\n\nPersons are generally prohibited from purchasing a firearm if:[https://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf]  \n* they have been convicted of a felony, or any other crime for which they could have been sentenced to more than a year in prison, or are under indictment for such\n* they are a fugitive from justice\n* they have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n* they are an unlawful user of, or addicted to, controlled substances, including marijuana\n* they have been adjudicated mentally defective\n* they have been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions\n* they have renounced their United States citizenship\n\nThe carrying of weapons, either openly or concealed, is regulated by the states, and these laws have changed rapidly over the past decade.  most states grant licenses to carry handguns on a shall-issue basis to qualified applicants. A few states leave the issuance of carry permits to the discretion of issuing authorities (called may-issue), while eleven states allow the carrying of firearms in a concealed manner without a permit (called Constitutional carry). Twenty-six states allow for open carrying of handguns without a permit while, in general, twenty states require a permit to do so and four states plus Washington D.C. ban open-carry of handguns. There have been legal challenges to concealed-carry laws, with different rulings to their constitutional validity.\n\nAsia\n\nPeople's Republic of China (PRC)\n\nGun ownership in the People's Republic of China (PRC) is strictly regulated by law. Generally, private citizens are not allowed to possess guns. Civilian ownership of guns is largely restricted to authorized, non-individual entities, including sporting organizations, authorized hunting reserves, and wildlife protection, management and research organizations. The chief exception to the general ban on individual firearm ownership is for the purpose of hunting.\nIllegal possession or sale of firearms may result in a minimum punishment of 3 years in prison, and penalties for arms trafficking include life imprisonment.\n\nHong Kong and Macau\n\nIn Hong Kong and Macau, gun ownership is tightly controlled and possession is mainly in the hands of law enforcement, military, and private security firms (providing protection for jewelers and banks). Under Section 13 of Cap 238 Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance of the Hong Kong law, a license is required for unrestricted firearms and ammunition. A license may be issued after a rigorous process to check for criminal records or a history of mental illness. License holders may store other firearms at home in a locked box, but ammunition must be kept at a different premises. Only fully automatic firearms appear prohibited; those found in possession without a licence could be fined HKD$100,000 and face imprisonment for up to 14 years.\n\nEast Timor\n\nUnder East Timorese law, only the military and police forces may possess, carry and use firearms.\n\nIn late June 2008, the Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão, introduced a proposed gun law to Parliament for \"urgent debate\", pushing back scheduled budgetary discussions. The new law, which would allow civilians to own guns, sparked heated debates in the East Timorese parliament. The United Nations, which has a peacekeeping force deployed in the nation, also expressed concerns over the new law.\n\nIndia\n\nGuns in India are strictly regulated by law. The Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules 1962 prohibit the sale, manufacture, possession, acquisition, import, export, and transport of firearms and ammunition unless under a licence, which is difficult to obtain. The Indian Government has a monopoly over the production and sale of firearms, with the exception of some breech-loading smooth-bore shotguns, of which a limited number may be produced and imported. The Arms Act classifies firearms into two categories: Prohibited Bore (PB) and Non-Prohibited Bore (NPB), where all semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms fall under the Prohibited Bore category. The Arms Act of 1962 added to the PB category any firearm which can chamber and fire ammunition of the caliber .303, 7.62 mm, .410, .380, .455, .45 rimless, or 9 mm. Smooth-bore guns having barrels shorter than 20 in are also specified as PB guns.\n\nLicences for acquisition and possession of both PB and NPB firearms could be given by a state government or district magistrate before 1987. From that year, the issuing of licenses for PB firearms became the responsibility of the central government. Licenses are valid for three years and may be renewed. The sale of firearms requires both parties to possess the permit.\n\nThe criteria considered during the issue of NPB firearm permits are whether the applicant faces a threat to their life. PB firearms criteria are more stringent, often for persons in government positions who face immediate danger or threats, those whose occupation involves open threats and danger, and family members of such people. PB licences became more regulated in 2014, when otherwise-eligible persons were frequently rejected on basis of national security grounds.[http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/firearms]  [http://www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/scasia.htm ] [http://disarmament.un.org/cab/salw-nationalreports.html ] Graduate Institute of International Studies, Small Arms Survey 2003: Development Denied, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 59-60; 112. Williams James Arputharaj, Chamila Thushani Hemmathagama and Saradha Nanayakkara, A Comparative Study of Small Arms Legislation in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka: South Asia Partnership (SAP) International, July 2003.Niobe Thompson and Devashish Krishnan, \"Small Arms in India and the Human Costs of Lingering Conflicts\", in Abdel-Fatau Musah and Niobe Thompson, eds., Over a Barrel: Light Weapons and Human Rights in the Commonwealth, London and New Delhi: Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), November 1999, pp. 35-64. Exceptions are made for defence officers who are allowed to keep firearms without licences under the Defence Service rule, and a handful of professional shooters.\n\nThe most common household firearm is a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun (known as DBBL 12 Bore). Other common firearms are .315 bolt-action rifles (magazine capacity of 5 cartridges) and .32 revolvers (capacity of 6 cartridges).\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndonesia has generally strict gun laws. Licences are normally only issued to civilians employed in a profession that involves firearms such as military and law enforcement, with an exception for politicians and businessmen.\n\nApplicants must be a minimum age of 21 years to obtain a firearms licence, and go through a very thorough background check and mental evaluation. They must also state a genuine reason for wanting to own a firearm, which would include hunting, target shooting, collecting, security, and self-defence. All firearms must be registered. Gun permits are valid for five years and may be renewed.\n\nCivilians cannot possess military weapons, but may possess long rifles. Handguns can only be used for sport-shooting and hunting. In 2012 however, it is claimed that the police had been issuing permits to regular citizens.\n\nIsrael\n\nGun laws in Israel are comprehensive despite soldiers being allowed to carry their service weapons on or off duty. Civilians must obtain a firearms licence to lawfully acquire, possess, sell or transfer firearms and ammunition.\n\nOnly a small group of people are eligible for firearms licenses: certain retired military personnel, police officers or prison guards; residents of frontier towns (in the West Bank and the Golan Heights) or those who often work in such towns; and licensed hunters and animal-control officers.  Age requirements vary:  20 or 21 for those who completed military service or civil service equivalent, 27 otherwise, and 45 for non-citizens.  Firearm license applicants must have been a resident of Israel for at least three consecutive years, pass a background check (criminal, health, and mental history), establish a genuine reason for possessing a firearm (such as self-defense, hunting, or sport), and pass a weapons-training course. Around 40% of applications for firearms permits are rejected.\n\nThose holding firearms licenses must renew them and pass a shooting course every three years, and undergo psychological assessment at least once every six years. Security guards must pass these tests to renew their license to carry firearms belonging to their employers. Applicants must demonstrate that they have a safe at their residence in which to keep the firearm. Permits are given only for personal use, and holders for self-defense purposes may own only one handgun and purchase an annual supply of 50 cartridges (although more may be purchased to replace rounds used at a firing range).\n\nIn addition to private licenses of firearms, organizations can issue carry-licenses to their members or employees for activity related to that organization (e.g. security companies, shooting clubs, other workplaces). Members of officially recognized shooting clubs (e.g.: practical shooting, Olympic shooting) are eligible for personal licenses allowing them to possess additional firearms (small bore rifles, handguns, air rifles and air pistols) and ammunition after demonstrating a need and fulfilling minimum membership time and activity requirements. Unlicensed individuals who want to engage in practice shooting are allowed supervised use of handguns at firing ranges.\n\nMost individuals who are licensed to possess handguns may carry them loaded in public, concealed or openly.\n\nIn 2005, there were 237,000 private citizens and 154,000 security guards licensed to carry firearms. Another 34,000 Israelis own guns illegally due to their failure to renew their firearms license. In 2007, there were estimated to be 500,000 licensed small arms held by civilians, in addition to 1,757,500 by the military, and 26,040 by the police.Karp, Aaron. 1 July 2006. \"Trickle and Torrent: State stockpiles\". Small Arms Survey 2006: Unfinished Business; Chapter 2 (Appendix I), p. 61. Oxford: Oxford University Press.Karp, Aaron. 27 August 2007. \"Completing the Count: Civilian firearms – Annexe online\". Small Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City; Chapter 2 (Annexe 4), p. 67 refers. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nJapan\n\nThe weapons law of Japan begins by stating \"No one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords\", and very few exceptions are allowed.\"Law Controlling Possession, Etc. of Fire-Arms and Swords\" (1978), Law No 6, Art 3, EHS Law Bulletin Series, No 3920.\nCitizens are permitted to possess firearms for hunting and sport shooting, but only after submitting to a lengthy licensing procedure.D Bayley, Forces of Order: Police Behavior in Japan and the United States (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), Art 4, 23.\nAfter ten years of shotgun ownership, a licence-holder may apply to obtain a rifle.\n\nKuwait\n\nKuwait has strict firearms laws. Firearms may be licensed to a citizen (or foreigner recommended by the Minister of Interior) who is at least 25 years old and fully capable of handling a weapon, with no criminal record, who is not a suspect or under police surveillance, and who has a source of income.[http://www.moi.gov.kw/portal/varabic/ShowPage.aspx?objectID=792bd90c-076a-443b-84dd-574a8bfd68eb]\nHunting shotguns are the most commonly licensed weapons. Rifles chambered for .22 long rifle are also common, with hunting and sniper rifles more difficult to obtain. Handguns are only allowed for VIPs. Automatic rifles and machine guns are not legally permitted for civilian possession.\n\nLebanon\n\nIn the Lebanese Republic, ownership of any firearm other than handguns, hunting arms and antiques is illegal and only the latter two are permitted to leave the owner's home, making Lebanon one of the most gun-controlled nations in the Middle East. Disregard for this law, however, is prevalent. Lebanon does not officially grant the right to bear arms, but it is a firmly held cultural belief in the country. Firearms licenses are granted to certain individuals, but the test is not open to the public and requires a particular need to be demonstrated.\n\nGun control has been largely unsuccessful in Lebanon due to a historic gun culture, a lack of effective central government control or authority over many parts of the country, and the tumultuous nature of the region. Although gunsmithing was once prominent in the region, it has all but ceased since the mid-1930s, yet it remains legal with a permit. Lebanon has come to be one of the largest arms markets in the Middle East.\n\nLebanon ranks 58th worldwide for privately owned firearms per capita.\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalaysia has strict gun laws. The Arms Act (1960) requires Malaysian citizens to have a license for manufacture, import, export, repair, or ownership of firearms. A firearm license can only be granted by the Chief Police Officer of a state. Discharging a firearm in crimes such as extortion, robbery, resisting arrest and house-breaking is punished by the death penalty. Exhibiting a firearm for any of the scheduled offences (without discharging) carries a penalty of life imprisonment and caning of not less than six strokes. Possession of unlawful firearms carries a sentence of up to fourteen years in prison and caning. While the general public cannot obtain a gun through legal means, a black market for guns does exist.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe North Korea strictly prohibits the use, ownership, manufacture, or distribution of firearms by any citizen not serving in the military or special sectors of the government \"executing official duties\". Anyone in violation of firearms laws are subject to \"stern consequences\".\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan has permissive firearm laws compared to the rest of South Asia, and has the sixth-highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Laws regulate the carrying of weapons in public in most urban areas. Private guns are prohibited in educational institutions, hostels, boarding and lodging houses, fairs, gatherings or processions of a political, religious, ceremonial, or sectarian character, and on the premises of courts of law or public offices. The law in Pakistan does not stipulate that a gun licence should be denied or revoked, and a license permits ownership of any number of weapons including handguns of any size and fully automatic weapons. Gun culture is strong among Pakistanis and a traditionally important part of rural life in its North-Western areas where it is not uncommon to see people legally carrying RPGs and assault rifles.\n\nPhilippines\n\nThe Philippines has generally strict gun laws, though liberal in comparison to other Asia-Pacific countries due to its active gun culture.  Philippine gun control became notorious in 1972 during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos who implemented a near-prohibition of all civilian guns. Current gun laws in the Philippines are outlined from Republic Act 10591, signed in 2013. In order to own a firearm, a citizen must acquire a Possession License. Applicants must be of a minimum age of 21 years and have no history of criminal activity or domestic violence. License-holders may carry handguns in public with the acquisition of a Permit to Carry (PTC), which are granted on a may-issue basis. Applicants must demonstrate a need for a PTC, such as an imminent threat of danger; PTCs are typically granted to lawyers, accountants, media practitioners, cashiers, bank tellers, priests, ministers, rabbis, imams, physicians, nurses, or engineers.\n\nMost Filipinos own firearms for self-protection and target-shooting, which require licenses. Despite the strict laws, gun culture is particularly strong in the Philippines, in part due to the influence of American culture.\n\nSingapore\n\nCitizens in Singapore must obtain a license to lawfully possess firearms or ammunition; applicants must provide justification for the licence, such as target shooting or self-defense. Target-shooting licences permit ownership of a gun, provided it is securely stored in an approved and protected firing range, and is not taken out of the firing range without special permission. Self-defence permits are rarely granted, unless one can justify an 'imminent threat to life that cannot be reasonably removed'. There is no restriction on types of small arms one may own after obtaining a licence.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThe Republic of Korea, known as South Korea, has strict gun policies. Hunting and sporting licenses are issued, but any firearm used in these circumstances must be stored at a local police station. Air rifles also have to be stored at police stations; crossbows and electric shock devices are also classified as firearms but their private retention is permitted. Tasers are prohibited, and possessing a toy gun without an orange tip is strictly prohibited. Violation of firearms law can result in a US$18,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe majority of South Korean men are well-trained in the use of firearms, due to mandatory military service. Despite this, gun culture is notably absent in South Korean society outside of the military, and gun ownership and deaths rank among the lowest in the world.\n\nTaiwan\n\nGun ownership in Taiwan is prohibited to ordinary citizens. There are currently more than 5,000 legal private handgun owners, of which 1,000 are used for self-defense and 4,000 are used for hunting by the Taiwanese aborigines. Gun owners in Taiwan are required to receive regular inspections every two years as well as random inspections by the police.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2009/10/23/229755/Strict-gun.htm\n\nThailand\n\nA firearm license in Thailand is granted only for self-defense, property protection, hunting, or sporting use. A license may not be issued to anyone who is a repeat offender or mentally unstable. Since Oct 2017 citizenship is https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/thailand-amendments-to-firearms-law/ required to purchase and use firearms. A person is also not allowed to carry their gun without an additional permit for concealed carry. Even for Thai citizens permitted to own firearms, firearms are expensive. Fully automatic firearms and explosive devices are prohibited.\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkey is restrictive in terms of gun control statutes. Automatic and semi-automatic firearms are \"prohibited for civilian possession (with no or limited exceptions)\", and for any application, \"an applicant may be asked to produce a medical certificate confirming he or she is capable of handling firearms and that he or she has no psychological – or physical – impediments\". Background checks are mandatory, and a \"genuine reason\" is required for issue of licenses.\n\nCivilians must additionally apply through the police for a handgun carry permit or a rifle carry license (the latter also requiring a hunting license). They must have a special reason prior to application, and the carry licenses are expensive. Special professions like police officers, military personnel, judges, public prosecutors, and senior politicians have their own life-time license from the government, and can apply for free licenses for handgun and rifle carry.\n\nEurope\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina has relatively liberal weapon laws compared to the rest of Europe. Weapons are regulated by the Weapons and Ammunition Law. People over 21 may apply for a permit. Those with a history of criminal activity, mental disorders, alcohol or drug abuse will be denied a permit. There is also a thorough background check, interviewing neighbors and family, and the applicant must complete a course and pass a multiple-choice exam. Police have the last word on the matter, with an appeal possible to a captain of police. Firearms must be kept in a \"safe place\" in a residence, and may be confiscated by police if the owner is found irresponsible. Concealed carry is allowed with a permit. Pepper spray may be carried by females if registered with police.\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn Georgia, civilians above 18 years of age may obtain a firearm permit from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, allowing them to purchase and keep firearms for hunting and sports (pump-action shotguns, hunting rifles, carbines, combined hunting firearms), self-defense (handguns, air guns, sprays, electric tranquilizers) or collections. Permits are denied to persons who are mentally ill, drug addicts, alcoholics, and those who have criminal records.http://police.ge/files/pdf/sakanonmdeblo%20baza/6.Law_on_Arms.pdf\n\nIceland\n\nIn Iceland, a license is required to own or possess firearms. A national government safety course must be passed before applying for a license. A special license is required to own a handgun, which may only be used for target shooting at a licensed range. Semi-automatic firearms have caliber restrictions, while fully automatic firearms are only permitted for collectors.\n\nNorway\n\nFirearms in Norway are regulated by the Firearm Weapons Act,\nwith a new secondary law in effect 1 July 2009 providing more detailed regulation. A firearms licence for rifles or shotguns can be issued by police to \"sober and responsible\" persons 18 years of age or older, with a clean police record, who document a need for the weapon. This may require first obtaining a hunting license or sports-shooting licence. For handguns, the minimum ownership age is 21. The firearms or their vital components must be stored securely in the residence, and the police may make inspections after a 48-hour notice.\n\nRussia\n\nRussian citizens over 18 years of age can obtain a firearms licence after attending gun-safety classes and passing a federal test and background check.  The licence is for five years and may be renewed. Firearms may be acquired for self-defense, hunting, or sports activities. Carrying permits may be issued for hunting firearms licensed for hunting purposes. Initially, purchase is limited to smooth-bore long-barred firearms and pneumatic weapons with a muzzle energy of up to 25 J. After five years of shotgun ownership, rifles may be purchased. Handguns are generally not allowed. Rifles and shotguns with barrels less than 800 mm long are prohibited, as are firearms that shoot in bursts and have more than a 10-cartridge capacity. Suppressors are prohibited. An individual cannot possess more than ten guns (up to five shotguns and up to five rifles) unless they are part of a registered gun collection.\n\nSerbia\n\nSerbia has weapon laws and ranks second in guns per capita with a strong gun culture, especially in rural areas. Weapons are regulated by Weapons and Ammunition Law (Zakon o oružju i municiji).\n\nPeople over age 18 may own firearms with a permit, which is denied to those with a criminal history, mental disorder, or history of alcohol or illegal substance abuse. There is a thorough background check with police having the final decision. Firearms must be stored in a \"safe place\", and may be confiscated by police if the owner is found irresponsible.\n\nRifles, shotguns and handguns may be owned, though licensing for handguns is strict. Concealed carry permits for handguns require proving an imminent threat, with the police making the final decision. There is no limit on the number of firearms owned, though every gun transaction is recorded by the police. There is no rifle caliber restriction (smaller than .50BMG, however). Fully automatic weapons are prohibited. People over 18 years of age can buy and carry stun guns and electric tranquilizers with no permit needed. People over 16 can carry OC sprays.[http://nsp-policija.org.rs/zakon-o-oruzju-i-municiji/] Acquisition of ammunition is unrestricted in terms of the number of rounds, but rounds can be bought only for the caliber in which owned firearm is chambered. Reloading is allowed only to those who have passed an exam in handling explosive materials.\n\nSerbia has its own civilian gun and ammunition industry. Zastava Arms,[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=176]   Prvi Partizan and Krušik export internationally.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGun possession in Switzerland is relatively high compared to most European countries (the rate of Swiss households containing at least one firearm was estimated at 24.45% by the 2016 figures of GunPolicy.org, – lower than Germany, France, and Austria – though including militia-issued firearms). The Swiss have universal conscription for military service. A recent referendum in 2011 on a call to force military weapons to be kept at military sites was defeated. Weapons may voluntarily be kept in the local armory and there is no longer an obligation to keep the weapon at home.\n\nThe Swiss \"Federal Law on Arms, Arms Accessories and Ammunitions\" (WG, LArm) of 20 June 1997 has as its objectives (Article 1) to combat the wrongful use of arms, their accessories, parts and ammunition. It governs the acquisition of arms, their introduction into Swiss territory, export, storage, possession, carrying, transport, and brokerage. It regulates the manufacture and trade in arms, and seeks to prevent the wrongful carrying of ammunition and dangerous objects. Article 3 states that \"The right to acquire, possess and carry arms is guaranteed in the framework of this law\".\n\nUkraine\n\nUkraine is the only European country without firearms statutes; regulation is by Order No. 622 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A firearm license may be issued to citizens who meet an age requirement (21 for shotguns, 18 for shotguns for hunting purposes, and 25 for rifles), have no criminal record or history of domestic violence or mental illness and have a specific reason such as target shooting, hunting or collecting.  Handguns of .22, 9 mm, .357 magnum and .38 caliber are permitted only for target shooting and those who can prove a threat against their lives (who are typically also given concealed carry permits). All firearms must be stored unloaded in a safe.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean Directive  91/477/EC sets minimum standards regarding civilian firearms acquisition and possession that EU Member States must implement into their national legal systems. The Member States are free to adopt more stringent rules, which leads to differences in the extent of legal access to firearms among EU countries., recital.\n\nThe Directive established a series of four categories of firearms (A-B-C-D) in order of decreasing regulation of legal access, with firearms from the first two categories subject to authorization and the third subject to registration. Category C and above require a good cause for possession and a background check for danger posed to themselves, public order and public safety. It also set a minimum age for possession at 18 years across all four categories.\n* Category A (prohibited) includes fully automatic firearms, ammunition with penetrating, explosive or incendiary projectiles, and handgun ammunition with expanding projectiles (except where entitled). Authorization may be possible in special cases.European Firearms Directive, Art. 6\n* Category B (restricted) includes semi-automatic or repeating short firearms, single-shot short centerfire firearms, single-shot rimfire firearms less than 28 cm overall, semi-automatic long firearms with greater than 3-round capacity (including the chamber) (or which can be converted to such), repeating and semi-automatic long firearms with smoothbore barrels less than 60 cm long, and semi-automatic firearms which resemble fully automatic weapons.European Firearms Directive, Art. 5\n* Category C (declared) includes semi-automatic firearms, repeating long firearms, and long rifle-barreled firearms not covered in Category B, and single-shot short rimfire firearms not less than 28 cm overall.\n* Category D (other) includes single-shot long firearms with smooth-bore barrels.\n\nAustria\n\nIn Austria, firearms are registered by licensed dealers or gunsmiths within 6 weeks of purchase by a citizen aged 18 or over, after completing a background check. Break-action and repeating rifles and break-action shotguns can be purchased without restriction. Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns (non-pump action) require a firearm license or a concealed-carry permit, and must be stored securely. Fully automatic weapons, some military-style semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and shotguns with barrels shorter than 45 cm or 90 cm overall are restricted, with licenses rarely issued.\n\nAntique weapons made before 1871 require no license or registration. Ammunition sales are generally unrestricted, though a permit is required for handgun ammunition and some rifle ammunition.\n\nCyprus\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus has strict gun control. Private citizens are completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any calibre, including .22 rimfire.  Shotguns limited to two rounds are allowed with a licence, issued by provincial police. Shotguns must be for hunting purposes, and a licensed citizen may own up to ten shotguns, typically double-barrelled. A firearm licence is required to buy ammunition, of up to 250 shells per purchase, with sales recorded.  Cyprus also controls airguns, and airgun owners require a licence.Grupp, Larry (2011). The Worldwide Gun Owner's Guide. Scottsdale, Arizona: Bloomfield Press, 365pp.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nThe Czech Republic is unusual in that the vast majority of gun owners (240,000 out of 300,000) possess their firearms for purposes of self-defense. Furthermore, Czech Republic has a shall-issue concealed carry permit system, whereby every self-defense license holder may carry up to two concealed firearms ready for immediate self-defense. This gives Czech Republic a higher rate of concealed carry weapons per capita than the US (by 2010 data) despite much lower gun-ownership rates.\n\nGun licenses may be obtained by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Though general firearms ownership rate remains relatively low, the ability to possess and carry firearms in general is understood as a basic freedom. This stems from historical experience of firearm bans under Nazi and Communist dictatorships.\n\nCrime with legally owned firearms is rare, with 45 recorded incidents in 2016, 17 of which were \"dangerous threats\" (compared to the total number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms). Gun laws had not been an issue until the EU Directive (see above), which led to the proposal of securing Czech citizens' gun rights through adoption of a constitutional amendment that would make firearms possession in the country a national security issue, thus taking it outside the scope of EU law. However, this provision was not approved by the Senate of the Czech Parliament, and therefore didn't become law, as constitutional laws need to be approved by senate in order to pass.\n\nDenmark\n\nCivilians in Denmark aged 16 and above can acquire gun licenses for hunting or sport shooting. This requires passing a written multiple-choice test and a practical test, after which the police determines if the applicant is suitable to own a weapon. A license is usually provided if the applicant has no or only minor marks on their criminal record.\n\nA hunting license permits the over-the-counter-purchase and ownership of an unlimited number of shotguns of up to 12 gauge and 2-round capacity; licenses to purchase rifles are issued on a case-by-case basis, but in general, there is no limit on the number or type of bolt-action rifles. Semi-automatic rifles are allowed if the rifle is limited to 2 rounds (hunting in Denmark), or without limitation on capacity (hunting outside of Denmark). Currently, only larger calibres (.308, 6,5x55, .300wm etc) are issued as semi-auto rifles for hunting abroad. .223/5.56x45 and similar caliber rifles are generally not approved.\nThe hunter must pass a shotgun or rifle shooting test before being allowed to hunt.\n\nFor sport-shooting purposes, shotguns can be used as well, as can bolt-action rifles of almost any caliber (.50bmg as one of the exceptions). Sporting rifles are often chambered in 22lr and 6.5 x 55 mm.\nSemi-automatic rifles are not allowed for sports shooting.\n\nHandgun: After two years of active membership in a shooting club, one can apply for a handgun permit which is then subject for background check and approval by the police, and one has to be 20 years old.\nApproved calibers:  All calibers under 9mm (9x19, 38 Spl, 357 magnum, .32acp etc), plus a limited number of larger calibers; .40sw, 45 ACP, 44 Spl.\nThe max number of handguns are 6 in 22 cal.\nWhen applying for gun number 3 it requires a special permit from the department of justice. Large caliber guns, bigger than 22 cal, are restricted to a maximum of 2 in the same caliber. Meaning one can only at a given time own 2 handguns in 9 mm. However, it is at the same time legal to own additional 2 handguns in 9 mm, if they are revolvers.\nFor all handguns, regardless of caliber, the overall length must be at least 210 millimeters (8.2677 inch), measured without orthopedic grip and removal parts.\n\nA weapon permit for sporting purposes (both long and short firearms) has to be renewed every 5 years. Rifle permits for hunting rifles has to be renewed every 10 years. Shotguns are not on individual permits, and you are allowed to own these as long as you have a valid hunting license - and you can keep them for up to 10 years after your hunting license expires - however you are not allowed to keep ammunition without a valid license.\n\nCarrying a firearm in public is strictly prohibited, however, proportional self defence is allowed. This means, that if you are attacked with a firearm, you are legally allowed to defend yourself proportionally - eg. with a firearm of your own.\n\nFully automatic weapons are prohibited for civilian use, unless a special permit is issued by the Ministry of Justice. These permits are extremely rare, and are normally only issued to people or companies working for, or supplying the Police or Military.\n\nIllegal possession of a firearm may be punished with imprisonment of no less than one year. Civilians may keep privately owned weapons, including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles at their residence.https://www.politi.dk/da/borgerservice/vaabentilladelse/blankvaaben.htm These and ammunition have to be stored in a approved gun cabinet (EN1143-1 grade 0 or better).https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=158805  §22 The police may inspect a shooting club's weapons at their discretion, but require a court order to inspect privately held firearms.[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/v%C3%A5ben/lovgivning Ministry of Justice – Weapons]\n\nFinland\n\nThe ownership and use of firearms in Finland is regulated by the country's Firearms Act of 1998. Weapons are individually licensed by local police, with no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use. No type of weapon is explicitly prohibited, but licences are granted only for a reason. In general, this excludes all but hunting and sports guns from non-professional use. Fully automatic weapons are generally not permitted. With the exception of law enforcement, only specially trained security guards may carry loaded weapons in public.\n\nIn November 2007, Finland updated their gun laws to comply with the EU directive by removing the ability of 15- to 18-year-olds to have their own permit, but a possibility to a have dual-license to an already licensed weapon with permission of the license holder remains in that age group. In 2011, a constitutional law committee concluded that people over the age of 20 can receive a permit for semi-automatic handguns; individuals must demonstrate continuous activity in handgun sporting for two years before they can have a license to possess their own handgun.\n\nFrance\n\nIn France, a hunting licence or a shooting sport license is needed to purchase a firearm. In September 2015, firearms were divided into four categories that determine the regulations that apply to their possession and use. Category C firearms can be obtained with a hunting licence or affiliation with a shooting range, and a medical certificate. Category B firearms additionally require completing at least three shooting sessions with an instructor.\n\nA person cannot own more than 12 centerfire firearms, and cannot own more than 10 magazines and 1,000 rounds of ammunition per firearm. A one-year carry license may be issued for persons \"exposed to exceptional risks to their life\" allowing to carry a handgun and a maximum of 50 rounds.  Such authorizations are extremely rare, as the state would provide police protection.  Since November 2015, police officers have been allowed to carry their firearms while off-duty.\n\nGermany\n\nGun ownership in Germany is restrictive, regulated by the Federal Weapons Act (German: Waffengesetz) of 1972.\nThe laws apply to weapons with a fire energy exceeding . A firearms licence may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, who are deemed reliable and can prove a necessity for owning a firearm. A separate license is required for each firearm owned. Target-shooters must have been a member of a shooting club with 18 recorded visits in the previous 12 months. A firearms carry permit is a second-tier license which allows concealed carry in public, and is only issued to those with a particular need.\n\nSeveral weapons and special ammunitions are completely prohibited, such as automatic firearms. Buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading of these weapons is illegal and punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the weapon and a fine of up to €10,000. Using an illegal weapon for crime of any kind is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nGermany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms legally owned by 1.4 million people.\n\nGreece\n\nGreece has strict gun control. Shotguns (limited to 3-round capacity) rifles and handguns are allowed, and these require a licence issued by provincial police. To purchase handguns and rifles, citizens must either have a concealed-carry permit or a target-shooting permit (for rifles). Semi auto rifles are prohibited. Hunters can own up to 10 shotguns and sport shooters can own up to 7 guns, and there is no license-check or record kept for ammunition purchases for shotguns but target shooters can only own 500 rounds per weapon.\n\nHungary\n\nGun law in Hungary is relatively strict, regulated by Law 24/2004 and Law revision 13/2012. Permission of the police, passing a psychological test (in some cases) and membership in a hunting or rifle club is required in order to own semi-automatic rifles, hunting rifles, shotguns or handguns.  Automatic rifles are prohibited.\n\nIn 2010, there were 129,000 registered gun owners (1.3% of the population) in Hungary with 235,000 firearms. The majority of these were hunting rifles and handguns for self-defense. Gun violence is very rare in Hungary; police use lethal weapons fewer than 10 times in a year, on average.\n\nIreland\n\nGun laws in Ireland are strict, requiring all firearms to be licensed individually through the Gardaí (police). Applicants must be 16 years of age and have a good reason for ownership, a secure location to store firearms, proof of competency with the firearm or arrangements to achieve such, provide access to medical records and two character references, and be of sound mind and temperate habits. Applicants convicted of certain specified offenses will be denied a firearms certificate. Personal protection is not a valid reason for ownership.\n\nIrish firearms law is based on the Firearms Act 1925, which was amended by several following acts in 1964, 1968, 1971, 1990, 1998 and 2000. The cumulative effect of these modifications, along with modifications in other acts and confusion over which amendments applied, resulted in a 2006 Irish Law Reform Commission recommendation that all extant legislation be restated (written in a single document with all prior Acts repealed).  However, the Criminal Justice Act 2006, contained a rewriting almost 80% of the Firearms Act. It was quickly followed by amendments in 2007 and further major amendments in 2009, exacerbating the legislative confusion.  the Law Reform Commission recommendation has not as yet been fully enacted; the Firearms Act consists of the initial 1925 Act amended by approximately twenty separate Acts and is well understood by only a handful of those directly involved in its drafting, amendment or usage. Extensive complaints have arisen over the application of the legislation, with several hundred judicial review cases won in the High Court and Supreme Court by firearms owners, all relating to licensing decisions which had not adhered to the Firearms Act.\n\nItaly\n\nIn Italy, national police issue gun licenses to those over the age of 18 without criminal records, who are not mentally ill or known substance abusers, who can prove competence with firearm safety.  A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a \"valid reason\" to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, six sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890). These limits can be exceeded with a collector license.\n\nPrivate firearms must be registered at the local police department within 72 hours of acquisition. Ammunition purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds of handgun ammunition and 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition.\n\nNetherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands, gun ownership is restricted to law enforcement, hunters, and target shooters (self-defense is not a valid reason to own firearms). A hunting license requires passing a hunters safety course. To own a gun for target shooting, the applicant must have been a member of a shooting club for a year. People with felonies, drug addictions, and mental illnesses may not possess firearms.\n\nOnce obtained, firearms must be stored in a safe and annually inspected by police. Firearms may only be used in self-defense as a matter of \"equal force\". Fully automatic firearms are banned, but there are otherwise few restrictions: semi-automatics, handguns, and magazines of all sizes are legal, as are all types of ammunition. A licensed gun owner may only have five firearms registered to his or her license at one time.[https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands Radio Netherlands Worldwide]\n\nPoland\n\nGun ownership in Poland is regulated by the Weapons and Munitions Act of 21 May 1999, as further amended,[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU19990530549/T/D19990549L.pdf Weapons and Munitions Act, full text] which requires a license to own and possess firearms. As a result of very strict controls in the past, gun ownership in Poland is the lowest in the EU, at 1 firearm per 100 citizens. However, the gun laws were relaxed in 2011 and again in 2014. Also year by year amount of permits given grows. This, in general, removed the police discretionary power to refuse a license without explanation.\nThe current law states that target shooting and collecting permits are shall issue and self-defense one is may issue.\n\nTo obtain a firearms license, the applicant must have no criminal record, undertake a medical and psychological evaluation and pass an exam appropriate to their reason for wanting a firearm (held by the police for self-defense, the Polish Sports Shooting Association for target shooting, or the Polish Hunting Association for hunting). Permits are issued indefinitely, although self-defense ones require passing medical and psychological evaluation every 5 years.\n\nEach permit specifies types and number of weapons the holder can own. These values vary greatly depending on license type and documented needs, but it's an established practice to receive around 5 slots for target shooting and hunting and 10 slots for collecting. A target-shooting license requires the applicant to possess a valid shooting competition license (by taking part in 2 to 4 ISSF-regulated shooting competitions per year for each category of firearm owned: handgun, rifle and shotgun), and allows carrying a loaded concealed firearm in public. A collecting license allows to obtain and use (in shooting range) any type of unstationary weapon including selective fire and fully automatic firearms. A self-defense license requires proving a \"constant, substantial and higher than average\" danger. There are separate, lifelong permits for high-ranking ex-military and police officers, generally allowing them to own one handgun. Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies.\n\nReplicas of black powder firearms designed before 1885 require no licence to own, and are therefore quite popular in the shooting community.\n\nRomania\n\nGun ownership in Romania is regulated by [http://legeaz.net/legea-295-2004-armelor-munitiilor/ Law 295/2004]. Romania has one of the toughest gun ownership laws in the world. In order for citizens to obtain a weapon, they must obtain a permit from the police, and must register their weapon once they purchase it. There are several categories of permits, with different requirements and rights, including hunting permits, self-defense permits, sports shooting permits and collectors permits. The only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits, magistrates, MPs, military forces and certain categories of diplomats. A psychological evaluation is required beforehand in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, knives with a blade longer than 15 cm are considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms.\n\nIn order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license, he must spend a certain \"practice time\" with a professional hunter. To obtain a self-defense permit, one must be under witness protection. Sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors' association, respectively.\n\nThe amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type. Sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun; Collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition.\n\nExplosive weapons and ammunitions, fully automatic weapons, weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object, armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited\n\nThe type of gun is also regulated by permit. Below is a shortened version of the table detailing the restrictions by type of lethal weapon and permit, for civilian owners. Note that for collectors, short weapons designed after 1945 are forbidden, while only non-lethal weapons are allowed for self-defense permits.\n\nIt is illegal to use or carry weapons with a muzzle velocity of over 10kJ if \"the barrel is fitted with devices conceived or adapted to reduce recoil\"\n\nNote that there are other restrictions for obtaining weapons under a sports-shooting license.\n\nMinors (14 and older) may also use a weapon, provided that they are under the supervision of someone who has a gun license. However, they cannot own or carry one until the age of 18.\n\nThe use of guns for self-defense is only allowed if the gun is a last resort option.\n\nSlovakia\n\nGun ownership in Slovakia is regulated principally by law 190/2003. \nA firearms license may be issued to an applicant at least 21 years of age, with no criminal history, and of sound health and mind, who passes an oral exam covering aspects of gun law, safe handling, and first aid. Licenses are issued in 6 categories: (A) concealed carry for self-defense, (B) home self-defense, (C) possession for work purposes, (D) long guns for hunting, (E) possession for sport shooting, and (F) collecting. A concealed carry license is only issued if the police deem a sufficient justification; about 2% of the adult population holds this license.\n\nThere is an exception for non-repeating muzzle-loaded firearms, which may be purchased without a license.\n\nSlovenia\n\nGun ownership in Slovenia is regulated under the \"Weapons Law\" (Zakon o orožju) which is harmonised with the directives of the EU. Gun permits are issued to applicants at least 18 years old, reliable, without criminal history and who has not been a conscientious objector, who passes a medical exam and a test on firearm safety. A specific reason must be given for gun ownership: for hunting or target shooting, the applicant must provide proof of membership in a hunting or sports shooting organization; for collection, the applicant must arrange safe storage with a level of security dependent on the type of weapons; for self-defence, the applicant must prove a risk to personal safety to such an extent that a weapon is needed.\n\nAs in most EU member states, the ownership of Category A firearms is prohibited; however these can be owned by weapon collectors, providing that requirements are met. Firearms must be stored in a locked cabinet with ammunition stored separately. Concealed carry is allowed in special circumstances. A gun permit is also required for airguns with muzzle velocity greater than 200 m/s or energy of 20 J.\n\nSpain\n\nFirearm regulation in Spain is restrictive, enacted in Real Decreto 137/1993. A firearm license may be obtained from the Guardia Civil after passing a police background check, a physiological and medical test, and a practical and theoretical exam. Shotgun and rifle licenses must be renewed after 5 years, subject to firearm inspection.  Sporting licences must be renewed after 3 years.  Police may inspect firearms at any time. A self-defence and concealed carry license must be renewed every year, and is only available under special conditions.\n\nA license-holder may own up to 6 rimfire rifles and 6 shotguns, and as many centerfire rifles as they can securely store. With a sporting licence, valid for 3 years, 1 to 10 handguns may be owned, depending on sports-shooting level. Magazine capacity for semi-automatic centerfire rifles is limited to 4 rounds for sports shooting and 2 rounds for hunting; semi-automatic shotguns are limited to 2 rounds. Rimfire rifles, regardless of type have no magazine limit. Rifles chambered for certain \"war calibres\"  are prohibited, such as .223/5.56 NATO and .50 cal. and Winchester 308 and 7.68x39 (AK round) is only permitted in bolt-action or single-shot weapons. Proof of ownership of an approved safe is required for all centerfire rifles and handguns, and the owner is responsible for firearm thefts. Ammunition must be stored separately. Rifle and handgun ammunition may only be possessed for legally owned weapons, and purchases and possession is limited to 200 rounds rifle and 100 rounds for handguns. In addition, there are yearly limits in quantity; however additional quantities can be petitioned. For shotgun Ammunition adults with a valid ID can purchase/possess up to 5,000 shells and there are no yearly limits in quantity. Licence-holders are only allowed to transport their unloaded firearms from their residence to the shooting range or hunting field and back, with no detours. Firearms may only be discharged at approved shooting ranges or hunting grounds (in season).\n\nThere are firearm license for private security for handguns and rifles. These cannot be used outside of work and must be stored in the workplace premises (with approved safe).\n\nIn addition there are handgun license for self-defense in concealed carry. However, this is granted on a \"may issue\" basis with several standards of necessity to be met and very few are granted. This license must be renued annually and is not automatic.\n\nMembers of police forces and officers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces have a special firearms licence which encompasses all of the others. There are additional licenses for collectors and muzzle-loading firearms. English summary from the U.S. Law Library of Congress\n\nSweden\n\nGun ownership in Sweden is regulated by Vapenlagen 1996:67 (literally, The Weapon Law),\nmodified by weapon decree Vapenförordningen 1996:70\nand FAP 551-3 / RPSFS 2009:13. The police issue licenses to persons in good standing who have passed a hunting examination or belonged to an approved shooting club for six months. License-holders are usually 18 years or older, and may lend a weapon to a person at least 15 years of age for supervised use.\n\nA license-holder may own up to six hunting rifles, ten handguns, or a mix of eight rifles and handguns. Firearms must be stored in an approved safe. A firearm registered for sport shooting may not be used for hunting. A concealed carry permit can be obtained under very special circumstances, such as a proven threat to life.\n\nFirearm collectors must have a clearly stated demarcation of their interest in collecting (e.g.: pre-World War II British handguns). The police may demand security measures on keeping the collection. Collectors may request a time-limited permit to discharge their weapons. Firearms manufactured before 1890 and not using sealed cartridges are exempt from the weapon law.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK increased firearm regulation through several Firearms Acts,\nleading to an outright ban on automatic firearms and most self-loading firearms. Breech-loading handguns are also tightly controlled.\nFirearm ownership usually requires a police-issued Shotgun Certificate (SGC) or Firearm Certificate (FAC). The applicant must have: no criminal convictions; no history of medical condition including alcohol and drug-related conditions; no history of depression, mental or nervous disorder, or epilepsy; and a secure gun safe to store firearms. The FAC additionally requires demonstrating a good reason for each firearm the applicant wishes to own (such as hunting, pest control, collecting, or target shooting). Self-defence is only accepted as a good reason in Northern Ireland.\n\nAn SGC allows the holder to purchase and own any number of shotguns, so long as they can be securely stored. Shotgun magazine capacity is limited to two rounds. For weapons covered under an FAC, police may restrict the type and amount of ammunition held, and where and how the firearms are used. Aside from Northern Ireland, private ownership of most handguns was banned in 1997.\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia\n\nGun laws in Australia are under the jurisdiction of the state governments, which collectively agreed to reforms in the 1996 National Firearms Agreement. The states issue firearms licenses for hunting or sport shooting. Licenses are widely prohibited for convicted offenders and those with a history of mental illness. Licenses must be renewed every 1 or 5 years (or 10 years in the Northern Territory). Licence-holders must be 18 years or age; minor's permits allow using a firearm under adult supervision by those as young as 12.\n\nHandguns may be obtained by target shooters and certain security guards after serving a probationary six-month period with a shooting club. Restricted weapons include military weapons, high-capacity semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns holding more than 5 rounds.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72622.html Arms Act 1983], legislation.govt.nz\nArms Amendment Act 1992,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0095/latest/DLM278351.html Arms Amendment Act 1992], legislation.govt.nz\nand Arms Regulations 1992,[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0346/latest/DLM168889.html Arms Regulations 1992], legislation.govt.nz\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms licence may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms licence being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/your-duties-and-legal-requirements \"Arms Code Section 5: Your duties and legal requirements\"], NZ Police\nwhich specifically excludes self-defence.[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing \"The law does not permit the possession of firearms 'in anticipation' that a firearm may need to be used in self-defence.\"] NZ Police\n\nOwnership of certain types of firearms require stricter vetting procedures, a higher level of storage security, and a \"special reason\" for obtaining the weapon. The applicant must gain an appropriate endorsement on their licence and a permit to procure before obtaining handguns, machine guns, selective-fire assault rifles, and military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) (including those with magazine capacity of more than 15 rounds of rimfire or 7 rounds of centerfire).\n\nComparison \n\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNotes:\nShall issue – subject to fulfillment of legal conditions, the authorities may not deny license and/or firearm(s)\nMay issue – the authorities have final say in whether a person may obtain a license and/or firearm(s)\n:May issue – Specific reason needed – a specific reason must be proven in order to obtain license, i.e. specific threat to life for concealed carry or firearms collecting for fully automatic firearm\n:May issue – restricted – although the law provides for possibility of obtaining necessary licenses and permits, in reality, these are rarely or almost never issued\nPrivate citizens – it is possible for a private citizen to legally acquire a gun (usually for hunting, sport shooting and often also for collecting)\nPersonal protection – personal protection or self-defence is a legitimate reason to own a firearm (or citizens are not legally required to establish a genuine reason)\nOpen carry – a private citizen may carry a loaded firearm openly for immediate self-defense in public (for example, with a special permit)\nConcealed carry – a private citizen may carry a concealed firearm for self-defense (for example, with a special permit)\nCarry without permit – a private citizen may carry a loaded firearm for immediate self-defense in public without any special permit\nFully automatic firearms – fully automatic firearms are allowed for civilians (for example, with a special permit); automatic weapons don't need to be permanently disabled\nUnlimited magazine – no limits on magazine capacity\nFree of checks – medical or background checks are not required (\"yes\" means \"not required\")\nFree of registration – firearms are not required to be registered – no \"illegal possession\" law (\"yes\" means \"not required\")\nMax penalty – maximum penalty for simple illicit firearm possession (no intent to commit crime with firearm), years in prison.
