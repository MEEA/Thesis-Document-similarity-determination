  "textBody" : "Around 45% of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as art, competition, force, machine, money, police, publicity, role, routine and table, are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.\n\nThis article, on the other hand, covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably \"French\" to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French diacritics and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French; an entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a solecism.\n\nSome of them were never \"good French\", in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage.

Commonly used for the same thing as in English in Quebec.\n; arrêt à bon temps: A counterattack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack in fencing. Though grammatically correct, this expression is not used in French. The term arrêt exists in fencing, with the meaning of a \"simple counteroffensive action\"; the general meaning is \"a stop\". A related French expression: s'arrêter à temps (to stop in time).\n; artiste: a skilled performer, a person with artistic pretensions. In French: an artist. Can be used ironically for a person demonstrating little professional skill or passion in both languages.\n; au naturel: nude; in French, literally, in a natural manner or way (au is the contraction of à le, masculine form of à la). It means \"in an unaltered way\" and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (un entretien au naturel = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like thon au naturel: canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning \"in natural colours,\" especially flesh colour, which is not one of the \"standard\" colours of heraldry.\n; auteur: A film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation.  The English connotation derives from French film theory.  It was popularized in the journal Cahiers du cinéma: auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work.  In French, the word means \"author\", but some expressions like cinéma d'auteur are also in use.\n; bête noire: a scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypal scary monster in a story; literally \"black beast.\" In French, être la bête noire de quelqu'un (\"to be somebody's black beast\") means that you're particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you're scary or not. The dictionary of the Académie française admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admits it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person, who is thus considered their archenemy (for instance, \"Nadal is the bête noire of Roger Federer\").\n; boutique: a clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise. The expression hôtel-boutique can be used to refer to upmarket hotels, but the word is recent and not as  widespread as the equivalent expression boutique hotel.\n; boutonnière: In English, a boutonnière is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonnière is the buttonhole itself. Yet the French expression \"Une fleur à la boutonnière\" has an equivalent meaning.\n; c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre: \"it is magnificent, but it is not war\" — quotation from Marshal Pierre Bosquet commenting on the charge of the Light Brigade. Unknown quotation in French.\n; cause célèbre: An issue arousing widespread controversy or heated public debate, lit. 'famous cause'. It is correct grammatically, but the expression is not used in French.\n; chacun à son goût: the correct expressions in French are chacun ses goûts / à chacun ses goûts / à chacun son goût: \"to each his/her own taste(s)\".\n; chanson:  a classical \"art song,\" equiv. to the German Lied or the Italian aria; or, in Russian, a cabaret-style sung narrative, usually rendered by a guttural male voice with guitar accompaniment. In French, it can be used to refer to any song, but it also refers to the same music genre as in English (someone practicing this genre being generally called a chansonnier in Quebec, especially if they sing at a restaurant or cabaret).\n; château: a manor house or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions. The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort (\"strong castle\") is used to describe a castle.\n; chef: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French, a professional cook is a cuisinier (lit. \"cook\"), chef-cuisinier referring to a head cook. Also, sous-chef, the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, chef used to means the head, for example a \"couvre-chef\" is a headgear, but by extension it's often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: \"chef d'État\" (lit. \"Head of State\" and \"Chief of State\"), \"chef d'entreprise\" (\"Business executive\"), \"chef d'orchestre\" (Conductor of an Orchestra), \"sergeant-chef\" (Staff Sergeant), \"chef de gare\" (stationmaster), \"chef de famille\" (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a chef is a boss.\n; cinq à sept: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm. In French, though it can also mean this, it primarily means any relaxing time with friends between the end of work and the beginning of the marital obligations.\n; claque: a group of admirers; in French, la claque is a group of people paid to applaud or disturb a piece at the theatre, though the common meaning of \"claque\" is \"a slap\"; clique is used in this sense (but in a pejorative way).\n; connoisseur: an expert in wines, fine arts, or other matters of culture; a person of refined taste. It is spelled connaisseur in modern French (lit. \"someone who knows\").\n; corsage: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.\n; coup de main (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, [donner] un coup de main means  \"[to give] a hand\" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in faire le coup de main), it is old-fashioned.\n; coup d'état (pl. coups d'État): a sudden change in government by force; literally \"hit (blow) of state.\" French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word (État: a State, as in a country; état: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as coup, which literally means a \"hit\" in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.\n; début: first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means \"beginning.\" The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: [faire] ses débuts [sur scène] (to make one's débuts on the stage).\n; décolletage: a low-cut neckline, cleavage.  In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment's neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe.\n; démarche: a decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step (often used in the plural form), a specific set of steps to get a specific result (can be used in the singular form, sometimes the expression \"marche à suivre\" (lit. \"step to follow\") will be preferred), or a distinctive way of walking.\n; dépanneur: a neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to dép or dep). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman. In France, a convenience store would be a supérette or épicerie [de quartier].\n; émigré: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word exilé (exiled) or réfugié (refugee) or even \"exilé politique\" or \"réfugié politique\".\n; encore: A request to repeat a performance, as in Encore!, lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a gig. Francophones would say « Une autre ! » ('Another one!') or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».\n; en masse: in a mass or group, all together. In French, masse refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: \"they all together said 'get out'\" would be translated as ils ont dit 'dehors' en chœur ([like a chorus]). Also, en masse refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Québécois French, it means \"a bunch\" (as in il y avait du monde en masse, \"there was a bunch of people\").\n; en suite: as a set (not to be confused with ensuite, meaning \"then\"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, suite, when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other.  J'ai loué une suite au Ritz would be translated as \"I rented a suite at the Ritz.\"  En suite is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used.\n; entrée: lit. \"entrance\"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or \"plat de résistance\" comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to \"main dish\".  In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.\n; épée: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.\n; escritoire: a writing table. It is spelt écritoire in modern French.\n; exposé: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of \"to expose\"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.\n; femme: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, femme (pronounced 'fam') means \"woman.\"\n; fin de siècle: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) turn-of-the-century but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means \"end of the century,\" but it isn't a recognized expression as such. The French expression \"ambiance [de] fin de règne\" (lit. \"end-of-reign atmosphere\") also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.\n; forte: a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French fort(e) (strong) and/or Italian forte (strong, esp. \"loud\" in music) and/or Latin forte (neuter form of fortis, strong). French uses fort(e) for both people and objects.\nAccording to Merriam Webster Dictionary, \"In forte we have a word derived from French that in its \"strong point\" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\'for-tE\\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived forte. Their recommended pronunciation \\'fort\\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word le fort and would rhyme it with English for [French doesn't pronounce the final \"t\"]. All are standard, however. In British English \\'fo-\"tA\\ and \\'fot\\ predominate; \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\for-'tA\\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.\"\nThe New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, le fort d'une épée is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.\n\n; hors d'oeuvre: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally \"outside of the work\". The French use apéritif to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet \"hors d'œuvre\" is a synonym of \"entrée\" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. In Québécois French, apéritif refers to the drink only, and hors-d'œuvre (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an entrée is a small dish (an entrée can be made as hors-d'œuvres, but not all of them are).\n; la sauce est tout: \"The sauce is everything!\" or \"The secret's in the sauce!\" Tagline used in a 1950s American television commercial campaign for an American line of canned food products. Grammatically correct but not used in French, where one might say Tout est dans la sauce or C'est la sauce qui fait (passer) le poisson.\n; Lavatoire or Lavatory: A once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word Toilet was a rather vulgar, impure, corruption of the French word \"Toilettes\" and that Lavatory was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, \"Lavatoire\", which was supposed to mean \"to wash, or to clean, yourself\". Actually, though the word Lavatoire does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The Lavatoire was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.\n; marquee: the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From marquise, which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (l'affiche).\n; : \"yearning for the mud\"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgie%20de%20la%20boue Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.\n; objet trouvé:  an ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an objet d'art because it is aesthetically pleasing.\"Throughout the year, the acquisition of a new vase or photograph, or the discovery of an object trouvé – a skeleton leaf, a fragment of painted paper, an intriguingly shaped piece of wood – is the excuse for a bout of rearranging,\" Elspeth Thompson, Still life with Agnès, The Sunday Telegraph Magazine, 18 August 1996. In French, les objets trouvés, short for le bureau des objets trouvés, means the lost-and-found, the lost property.\n; outré: out of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor's style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to \"literary\" style.\n; passé: out of fashion. The correct expression in French is passé de mode.  Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.\n; peignoir: a woman's dressing gown. It means bathrobe. In French, both peignoir and robe de chambre are used interchangeably, though the latter is generally considered formal and the former is generally seen as colloquial.\n; pièce d'occasion: \"occasional piece\"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means \"second-hand hardware.\" Can be shortened as pièce d'occas or even occas (pronounced /okaz/).\n; portemanteau (pl. portemanteaux): in English a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, Lewis Carroll, in his novel Through the Looking Glass playfully coined a further figurative sense for portmanteau meaning a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English/ Lewis-Carroll  portemanteau is un mot-valise (lit. a suitcase word).\n; potpourri: medley, mixture; French write it pot-pourri, literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.\n; précis: a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, précis means precise, accurate.\n; première: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. \"La première\" can be used in same way in French, but it more generally means \"the first\".\n; raisonneur: a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a raisonneur is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. raisonneuse) who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.\n; recherché: lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.\n; rendezvous: lit. \"present yourself\" or \"proceed to\"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: rendez-vous. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.\n; reprise: repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a cover version, or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term rediffusion is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term coda.\n; résumé: in North American English, a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead curriculum vitæ, or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).\n; risqué (also risque): sexually suggestive;\"Teacher Alan Faulkner warned: 'Some of the skirts were getting very risque and [...] the girls would face disciplinary action',\" Daily Mail, Saturday September 21, 1996. in French, the meaning of risqué is \"risky,\" with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead osé (lit. \"daring\") or sometimes dévergondé (very formal language). Osé, unlike dévergondé, cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.\n; rouge (lit. \"red\") : 1) a rouge is red makeup, also called blusher. Rouge à lèvres is French for \"lipstick\", even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is \"fard à joues\" ; 2) in Canadian football, a rouge is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone. .\n; séance : a gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.\n; table d'hôte (pl. tables d'hôte): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be \"a bed & breakfast\" or \"B&B.\"  The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'hôte (literally \"table of the house\" or \"table of the host\"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled \"table d'hôte\" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a \"bed & breakfast -style\" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, table d'hôte generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression couette et café (lit. \"duvet and coffee\") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.\n; tableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as tableau): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture. Tableau means painting, tableau vivant, living painting. In French, it is an expression used in body painting.\n; touché: acknowledgment of an effective counterpoint. In French, used for \"emotionally touched\".\n; vignette: a brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture or a thumbnail. By extension a vignette is the name of a compulsory road tax in the form of a small sticker affixed to a vehicle windscreen, which is now also used in several European countries.\n\nFound only in English \n\n; aide-de-camp: \"camp assistant\"; in the army, a military assistant to a senior military officer (heads of State are considered military officers because of their status as head of the army). In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written aide de camp (without any hyphens).\n; cinquefoil: five-petal, five-leaf flower of the genus Potentilla, family Rosaceae; also a circular 5-lobed ornamental design. Spelled quintefeuille in French.\n; cri de cœur: \"cry from the heart\": an impassioned outcry, as of entreaty or protest. In French, the exact expression is cri du cœur.\n; demi-monde: a class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use une demi-mondaine to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.\n; double entendre: a figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. \"Entendre\" is an infinitive verb (\"to hear\"), not a noun; a correct rendering would be \"à double entente\", an adjectival phrase meaning \"of a double understanding or double interpretation\" (literally, \"with a double hearing\"). The modern French phrase is \"à double sens\".\n; in lieu (of): \"in place (of)\": a hybrid phrase, partially translated from the existing French phrase au lieu.\n; léger de main (legerdemain): \"light of hand\": sleight of hand, usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French, and has no equivalent. \n; maître d': translates as master o. Francophones would say maître d'hôtel (literally \"master of the house\" or \"master of the establishment\") instead (French never uses \"d alone). In French as in English, \"maître d'\" means the \"head waiter\", the manager of the service side.\n; negligée: A robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women. French uses négligé (masculine form) or nuisette. In French, the word négligée qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.\n; pièce de résistance (piece de resistance): the best; the main dish in a meal, or the main item in a series, literally \"a piece that resists.\"\"The living room, with its leather sofa from Harrods, payphone and glass coffee table, is the pièce de résistance,\" My friend the high-flying dole cheat, The Daily Telegraph, Wednesday, August 14, 1996. Francophones use plat de résistance (main dish).\n; succès de scandale: \"Success through scandal\"; Francophones might use succès par médisance.\n; voir dire: a trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection (Law French). Literally \"to speak the truth.\"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voir%20dire?r=1 voir dire] The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2006) (Anglo-Norman voir [truth] is etymologically unrelated to the modern French voir [to see].)[http://www.anglo-norman.net/D/voir voir] The Anglo-Norman Dictionary  In modern American court procedure, the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve, including inherent biases, views and predelictions; during this examination, each prospective juror must \"speak the truth\" so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused.  In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a \"trial within a trial,\" during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not.  For example, a judge might hold a \"voir dire\" to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.\n\nFrench phrases in international air-sea rescue \n\nInternational authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues. Note that the \"phonetic\" versions of spelling are presented as shown and not the IPA.\n\n; SECURITAY: (sécurité, \"safety\") the following is a safety message or warning, the lowest level of danger.\n; PAN PAN: (panne, \"breakdown\") the following is a message concerning a danger to a person or ship, the next level of danger.\n; MAYDAY: ([venez] m'aider, come to help me\"; aidez-moi means \"help me\") the following is a message of extreme urgency, the highest level of danger. (MAYDAY is used on voice channels for the same uses as SOS on Morse channels.)\n; SEELONCE: (silence, \"silence\") keep this channel clear for air-sea rescue communications.\n; SEELONCE FEE NEE: (silence fini, \"silence is over\") this channel is now available again.\n; PRU DONCE: (prudence, \"prudence\") silence partially lifted, channel may be used again for urgent non-distress communication.\n; MAY DEE CAL: (médical, \"medical\") medical assistance needed.\n\nIt is a serious breach in most countries, and in international zones, to use any of these phrases without justification.\n\nSee Mayday (distress signal) for a more detailed explanation.",

    "aggregatedText" : "Around 45% of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as art, competition, force, machine, money, police, publicity, role, routine and table, are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.\n\nThis article, on the other hand, covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably \"French\" to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French diacritics and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French; an entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a solecism.\n\nSome of them were never \"good French\", in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage. Some others were once normal French but have become very old-fashioned, or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language, to the extent that they would not be understood (either at all, or in the intended sense) by a native French speaker.\n\nUsed in English and French \n\nA \n\n; à gogo: in abundance. In French this is colloquial.\n; à la: short for à la manière de; in the manner of/in the style of\"I like my nature programmes à la Attenborough, where Nature is the subject matter and the presenter remains unobtrusive,\" Christina Odone, Moving experiences should be private, The Daily Telegraph, Thursday, September 12, 1996.\n; à la carte: lit. \"on the card, i.e. menu\"; In restaurants it refers to ordering individual dishes rather than a fixed-price meal.\n; à propos: regarding/concerning (the correct French syntax is à propos de) \n; accouchement: confinement during childbirth; the process of having a baby; only this latter meaning remains in French\n; acquis communautaire: used in European Union law to refer to the total body of EU law accumulated thus far.\n; aide-de-camp: lit. \"camp helper\"; A military officer who serves as an adjutant to a higher-ranking officer, prince or other high political dignitary.\n; aide-mémoire: lit. \"memory aid\"; an object or memorandum to assist in remembrance, or a diplomatic paper proposing the major points of discussion\n; Allons-y!: \"Let's go!\" The letter \"y\" is the place.\n; amour propre: \"Self-love\", Self-respect.\n; amuse-bouche or amuse-gueule: lit. \"mouth-amuser\"; a single, bite-sized hors d'œuvre. In France, the exact expression used is amuse-gueule, gueule being slang for mouth (gueule is the mouth of a carnivorous animal; when used to describe the mouth of a human, it is vulgar), although the expression in itself is not vulgar (see also: cul-de-sac). The expression refers to a small mouthful of food, served at the discretion of the chef before a meal as an hors d'oeuvre or between main courses.\n; ancien régime: a sociopolitical or other system that no longer exists, an allusion to pre-revolutionary France (used with capital letters in French with this meaning: Ancien Régime)\n; aperçu: preview; a first impression; initial insight.\n; apéritif or aperitif: lit. \"[drink] opening the appetite\", a before-meal drink.See the definition given in CNRTL's Trésor de la langue française: \"[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/ap%E9ritif?

The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort (\"strong castle\") is used to describe a castle.\n; chef: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French, a professional cook is a cuisinier (lit. \"cook\"), chef-cuisinier referring to a head cook. Also, sous-chef, the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, chef used to means the head, for example a \"couvre-chef\" is a headgear, but by extension it's often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: \"chef d'État\" (lit. \"Head of State\" and \"Chief of State\"), \"chef d'entreprise\" (\"Business executive\"), \"chef d'orchestre\" (Conductor of an Orchestra), \"sergeant-chef\" (Staff Sergeant), \"chef de gare\" (stationmaster), \"chef de famille\" (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a chef is a boss.\n; cinq à sept: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm.

It is spelled connaisseur in modern French (lit. \"someone who knows\").\n; corsage: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.\n; coup de main (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, [donner] un coup de main means  \"[to give] a hand\" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in faire le coup de main), it is old-fashioned.\n; coup d'état (pl. coups d'État): a sudden change in government by force; literally \"hit (blow) of state.\" French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word (État: a State, as in a country; état: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as coup, which literally means a \"hit\" in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.\n; début: first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means \"beginning.\" The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: [faire] ses débuts [sur scène] (to make one's débuts on the stage).\n; décolletage: a low-cut neckline, cleavage.  In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment's neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe.\n; démarche: a decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step (often used in the plural form), a specific set of steps to get a specific result (can be used in the singular form, sometimes the expression \"marche à suivre\" (lit. \"step to follow\") will be preferred), or a distinctive way of walking.\n; dépanneur: a neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to dép or dep). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman. In France, a convenience store would be a supérette or épicerie [de quartier].\n; émigré: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word exilé (exiled) or réfugié (refugee) or even \"exilé politique\" or \"réfugié politique\".\n; encore: A request to repeat a performance, as in Encore!, lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a gig. Francophones would say « Une autre ! » ('Another one!') or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».\n; en masse: in a mass or group, all together. In French, masse refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: \"they all together said 'get out'\" would be translated as ils ont dit 'dehors' en chœur ([like a chorus]). Also, en masse refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Québécois French, it means \"a bunch\" (as in il y avait du monde en masse, \"there was a bunch of people\").\n; en suite: as a set (not to be confused with ensuite, meaning \"then\"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, suite, when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other.  J'ai loué une suite au Ritz would be translated as \"I rented a suite at the Ritz.\"  En suite is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used.\n; entrée: lit. \"entrance\"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or \"plat de résistance\" comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to \"main dish\".  In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.\n; épée: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.\n; escritoire: a writing table. It is spelt écritoire in modern French.\n; exposé: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of \"to expose\"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.\n; femme: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, femme (pronounced 'fam') means \"woman.\"\n; fin de siècle: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) turn-of-the-century but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means \"end of the century,\" but it isn't a recognized expression as such. The French expression \"ambiance [de] fin de règne\" (lit. \"end-of-reign atmosphere\") also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.\n; forte: a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French fort(e) (strong) and/or Italian forte (strong, esp. \"loud\" in music) and/or Latin forte (neuter form of fortis, strong). French uses fort(e) for both people and objects.\nAccording to Merriam Webster Dictionary, \"In forte we have a word derived from French that in its \"strong point\" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\'for-tE\\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived forte. Their recommended pronunciation \\'fort\\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word le fort and would rhyme it with English for [French doesn't pronounce the final \"t\"]. All are standard, however. In British English \\'fo-\"tA\\ and \\'fot\\ predominate; \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\for-'tA\\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.\"\nThe New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, le fort d'une épée is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.\n\n; hors d'oeuvre: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally \"outside of the work\". The French use apéritif to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet \"hors d'œuvre\" is a synonym of \"entrée\" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. In Québécois French, apéritif refers to the drink only, and hors-d'œuvre (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an entrée is a small dish (an entrée can be made as hors-d'œuvres, but not all of them are).\n; la sauce est tout: \"The sauce is everything!\" or \"The secret's in the sauce!\" Tagline used in a 1950s American television commercial campaign for an American line of canned food products. Grammatically correct but not used in French, where one might say Tout est dans la sauce or C'est la sauce qui fait (passer) le poisson.\n; Lavatoire or Lavatory: A once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word Toilet was a rather vulgar, impure, corruption of the French word \"Toilettes\" and that Lavatory was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, \"Lavatoire\", which was supposed to mean \"to wash, or to clean, yourself\". Actually, though the word Lavatoire does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The Lavatoire was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.\n; marquee: the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From marquise, which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (l'affiche).\n; : \"yearning for the mud\"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgie%20de%20la%20boue Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.\n; objet trouvé:  an ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an objet d'art because it is aesthetically pleasing.\"Throughout the year, the acquisition of a new vase or photograph, or the discovery of an object trouvé – a skeleton leaf, a fragment of painted paper, an intriguingly shaped piece of wood – is the excuse for a bout of rearranging,\" Elspeth Thompson, Still life with Agnès, The Sunday Telegraph Magazine, 18 August 1996. In French, les objets trouvés, short for le bureau des objets trouvés, means the lost-and-found, the lost property.\n; outré: out of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor's style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to \"literary\" style.\n; passé: out of fashion. The correct expression in French is passé de mode.  Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.\n; peignoir: a woman's dressing gown. It means bathrobe. In French, both peignoir and robe de chambre are used interchangeably, though the latter is generally considered formal and the former is generally seen as colloquial.\n; pièce d'occasion: \"occasional piece\"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means \"second-hand hardware.\" Can be shortened as pièce d'occas or even occas (pronounced /okaz/).\n; portemanteau (pl. portemanteaux): in English a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, Lewis Carroll, in his novel Through the Looking Glass playfully coined a further figurative sense for portmanteau meaning a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English/ Lewis-Carroll  portemanteau is un mot-valise (lit. a suitcase word).\n; potpourri: medley, mixture; French write it pot-pourri, literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.\n; précis: a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, précis means precise, accurate.\n; première: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. \"La première\" can be used in same way in French, but it more generally means \"the first\".\n; raisonneur: a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a raisonneur is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. raisonneuse) who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.\n; recherché: lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.\n; rendezvous: lit. \"present yourself\" or \"proceed to\"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: rendez-vous. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.\n; reprise: repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a cover version, or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term rediffusion is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term coda.\n; résumé: in North American English, a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead curriculum vitæ, or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).\n; risqué (also risque): sexually suggestive;\"Teacher Alan Faulkner warned: 'Some of the skirts were getting very risque and [...] the girls would face disciplinary action',\" Daily Mail, Saturday September 21, 1996. in French, the meaning of risqué is \"risky,\" with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead osé (lit. \"daring\") or sometimes dévergondé (very formal language). Osé, unlike dévergondé, cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.\n; rouge (lit. \"red\") : 1) a rouge is red makeup, also called blusher. Rouge à lèvres is French for \"lipstick\", even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is \"fard à joues\" ; 2) in Canadian football, a rouge is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone. .\n; séance : a gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.\n; table d'hôte (pl. tables d'hôte): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be \"a bed & breakfast\" or \"B&B.\"  The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'hôte (literally \"table of the house\" or \"table of the host\"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled \"table d'hôte\" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a \"bed & breakfast -style\" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, table d'hôte generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression couette et café (lit. \"duvet and coffee\") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.\n; tableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as tableau): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture. Tableau means painting, tableau vivant, living painting. In French, it is an expression used in body painting.\n; touché: acknowledgment of an effective counterpoint. In French, used for \"emotionally touched\".\n; vignette: a brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture or a thumbnail. By extension a vignette is the name of a compulsory road tax in the form of a small sticker affixed to a vehicle windscreen, which is now also used in several European countries.\n\nFound only in English \n\n; aide-de-camp: \"camp assistant\"; in the army, a military assistant to a senior military officer (heads of State are considered military officers because of their status as head of the army). In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written aide de camp (without any hyphens).\n; cinquefoil: five-petal, five-leaf flower of the genus Potentilla, family Rosaceae; also a circular 5-lobed ornamental design. Spelled quintefeuille in French.\n; cri de cœur: \"cry from the heart\": an impassioned outcry, as of entreaty or protest. In French, the exact expression is cri du cœur.\n; demi-monde: a class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use une demi-mondaine to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.\n; double entendre: a figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. \"Entendre\" is an infinitive verb (\"to hear\"), not a noun; a correct rendering would be \"à double entente\", an adjectival phrase meaning \"of a double understanding or double interpretation\" (literally, \"with a double hearing\"). The modern French phrase is \"à double sens\".\n; in lieu (of): \"in place (of)\": a hybrid phrase, partially translated from the existing French phrase au lieu.\n; léger de main (legerdemain): \"light of hand\": sleight of hand, usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French, and has no equivalent. \n; maître d': translates as master o. Francophones would say maître d'hôtel (literally \"master of the house\" or \"master of the establishment\") instead (French never uses \"d alone). In French as in English, \"maître d'\" means the \"head waiter\", the manager of the service side.\n; negligée: A robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women. French uses négligé (masculine form) or nuisette. In French, the word négligée qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.\n; pièce de résistance (piece de resistance): the best; the main dish in a meal, or the main item in a series, literally \"a piece that resists.\"\"The living room, with its leather sofa from Harrods, payphone and glass coffee table, is the pièce de résistance,\" My friend the high-flying dole cheat, The Daily Telegraph, Wednesday, August 14, 1996. Francophones use plat de résistance (main dish).\n; succès de scandale: \"Success through scandal\"; Francophones might use succès par médisance.\n; voir dire: a trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection (Law French). Literally \"to speak the truth.\"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voir%20dire?r=1 voir dire] The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2006) (Anglo-Norman voir [truth] is etymologically unrelated to the modern French voir [to see].)[http://www.anglo-norman.net/D/voir voir] The Anglo-Norman Dictionary  In modern American court procedure, the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve, including inherent biases, views and predelictions; during this examination, each prospective juror must \"speak the truth\" so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused.  In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a \"trial within a trial,\" during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not.  For example, a judge might hold a \"voir dire\" to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.\n\nFrench phrases in international air-sea rescue \n\nInternational authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues.
