  "textBody" : "Harlan Jay Ellison (born May 27, 1934) is an American writer. His principal genre is speculative fiction.\n\nHis published works include over 1,700 short stories, novellas, screenplays, comic book scripts, teleplays, essays, a wide range of criticism covering literature, film, television, and print media. He was editor and anthologist for two science fiction anthologies, Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). Ellison has won numerous awards including multiple Hugos, Nebulas and Edgars.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nEllison was born to a Jewish family[http://www.jewishjournal.com/geekheeb/item/top_5_jewish_moments_in_trek_20090507/ Jewish Journal: \"Top 5 Jewish moments in ‘Trek’\" by Adam Wills] May 7, 2009 in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (née Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler.[http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Harlan-Ellison.html \"Harlan Ellison Biography (1934–)\"]. filmreference.com His family subsequently moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home, taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, \"tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina, short-order cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, floorwalker in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House\".\n\nEllison attended The Ohio State University for 18 months (1951–53) before being expelled. He has said the expulsion was for hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability, and over the next twenty or so years he sent that professor a copy of every story he published.\n\nEllison published two stories in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, \"four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator.\"Gentleman Junkie, 14\n\nEllison served in the army from 1957 to 1959.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harlan-Ellison\n\nHollywood and beyond\n\nEllison moved to California in 1962, and subsequently began to sell his writing to Hollywood. He wrote the screenplay for The Oscar, starring Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer. Ellison also sold scripts to many television shows:  The Loretta Young Show (using the name Harlan Ellis),The Flying Nun, Burke's Law, Route 66, The Outer Limits,Keegan, Rebecca (October 5, 2010). The Futurist: The Life and Times of James Cameron, Three Rivers Press (Kindle location 885) Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Cimarron Strip, and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\nEllison's screenplay for the Star Trek episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" has been considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series. \n\nHe participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAlso in 1966, in an article Esquire magazine would later name as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote about the goings-on around the enigmatic Frank Sinatra. The article, entitled \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\", briefly describes a clash between the young Harlan Ellison and Frank Sinatra, when the crooner took exception to Ellison's boots during a billiards game.  Talese wrote of the incident, \"Sinatra probably forgot about it at once, but Ellison will remember it all his life.\"\n\nEllison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios but was fired on his first day after Roy O. Disney overheard him in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters. Ellison recounted this incident in his book Stalking the Nightmare, as part 3 of an essay titled \"The 3 Most Important Things in Life\".\n\nEllison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\" (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (1967) is an allegory of Hell, where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity; the story was the basis of a 1995 computer game; Ellison participated in the game's design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM. Another story, \"A Boy and His Dog\", examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, post-apocalyptic world and was made into the 1975 film of the same name, starring Don Johnson. \n\nEllison served as creative consultant to the 1980s version of  The Twilight Zone science fiction TV series and Babylon 5. As a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), he has voiceover credits for shows including The Pirates of Dark Water, Mother Goose and Grimm, Space Cases, Phantom 2040, and Babylon 5, as well as made an onscreen appearance in the Babylon 5 episode \"The Face of the Enemy\". \n\nEllison's 1992 short story \"The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore\" was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of The Best American Short Stories.Kennison, Katrina and Erdrich, Louise (editors), The Best American Short Stories 1993, New York, 1993.\n\nIn 2014 Ellison made a guest appearance on the album Finding Love in Hell by the stoner metal band Leaving Babylon, reading his piece \"The Silence\" (originally published in Mind Fields) as an introduction to the song \"Dead to Me.\"\n\nEllison and others have maintained his official website (harlanellison.com) for several years, however Ellison himself has not posted there since 2015. \n\nPseudonyms\n \n\nEllison has on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he feels his creative contribution to a project has been mangled beyond repair by others, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also Alan Smithee). The first such work to which he signed the name was \"The Price of Doom\", an episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of Burke's Law (\"Who Killed Alex Debbs?\") credited to Ellison contains a character given this name, played by Sammy Davis, Jr. \n\nThe \"Cordwainer Bird\" moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, Cordwainer Smith. The origin of the word \"cordwainer\" is shoemaker (from working with cordovan leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author. Ellison has said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean \"a shoemaker for birds\". Since he has used the pseudonym mainly for works he wants to distance himself from, it may be understood to mean that \"this work is for the birds\" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of \"the bird\" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled \"Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto\", describing his experience with the Starlost television series). \n\nThe Bird moniker has since become a character in one of Ellison's own stories, not without some prompting. In his book Strange Wine, Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jose Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, the Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in \"The New York Review of Bird,\" in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York Literary Establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of same. \n\nOther pseudonyms Ellison has used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, Harlan Ellis and Jay Solo.\n\nControversies and disputes\n\nTemperament\n\nEllison has a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative. Ellison has generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of his books described him as \"possibly the most contentious person on Earth\". Ellison has filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; as part of a dispute about fulfillment of a contract, he once sent 213 bricks to a publisher postage due, followed by a dead gopher via fourth-class mail.[http://harlanellison.com/text/newsfaq.txt \"alt.fan.harlan-ellison FAQ\" Version 1.5].  James Shearhart (jalmatom@wco.com). Archived at HarlanEllison.com. Last modified November 26, 1995. Retrieved 2012-11-17. In an October 21, 2017 piece in Wired, Ellison was dubbed, \"Sci-Fi's Most Controversial Figure.\"https://www.wired.com/2017/10/geeks-guide-harlan-ellison/\n\nStar Trek\n\nEllison has repeatedly criticized how Star Trek creator and producer Gene Roddenberry (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using \"Cordwainer Bird\" to indicate displeasure (above). \n\nEllison's original script was first published in the 1976 anthology Six Science Fiction Plays, edited by Roger Elwood. Ellison also novelized the story at that time, for the Star Trek Fotonovel series: The City on the Edge of Forever (Bantam Books, 1977, 0-553-11345-3). In 1995, Borderlands Press published The City on the Edge of Forever (), with nearly 300 pages, comprising an essay by Ellison, four versions of the teleplay, and eight \"Afterwords\" contributed by other parties. He greatly expanded the introduction for the paperback edition: Harlan Ellison's The City on the Edge of Forever, White Wolf Publishing, 1996; . It explains what he called a \"fatally inept treatment\". \n\nBoth versions of the script won awards: Ellison's original script won the 1968 Writers Guild Award for best episodic drama in television, while the shooting script won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television, seeking payment of 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison's behalf. On October 23, 2009, Variety magazine reported that a settlement had been reached.\n\nAggiecon I\n\nEllison was among those who in 1968 signed an anti-Vietnam War advertisement in Galaxy Science Fiction. In 1969, Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A&M University's first science fiction convention, Aggiecon, where he reportedly referred to the university's Corps of Cadets as \"... America's next generation of Nazis ...\", inspired in part by the continuing Vietnam War. Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the student body was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison's anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a Denny's because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school's administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year, and no guest of honor was invited for the next two Aggiecons. However, Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for Aggiecon V (1974) and Aggiecon XXXI (2000).\n\nThe Last Dangerous Visions\n\nThe Last Dangerous Visions (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison's anthology series, was originally announced for publication in 1973 but remains unpublished. Nearly 150 writers (many now dead) submitted works for the volume. In 1993, Ellison threatened to sue New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing \"Himself in Anachron\", a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and sold to Ellison for the book by his widow, but later reached an amicable settlement.\n\nBritish science fiction author Christopher Priest criticized Ellison's editorial practices in an article entitled \"The Book on the Edge of Forever\", later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish TLDV within a year of the statement. Priest claims he submitted a story at Ellison's request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by \"Book on the Edge of Forever\" and has, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions since its publication.\n\nI, Robot\n\nShortly after the release of Star Wars (1977), Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot short story collection for Warner Brothers. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warners, Robert Shapiro, Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the \"intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke\". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and published in book form.\nFrom Harlan Ellison's introduction to I Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay,  The 2004 film I, Robot, starring Will Smith, has no connection to Ellison's script.\n\nAllegations of assault on Charles Platt\n\nIn 1984 Ellison allegedly publicly assaulted author and critic Charles Platt at the Nebula Awards banquet. Platt did not pursue legal action against Ellison, and the two men later signed a \"non-aggression pact\", promising never to discuss the incident again nor to have any contact with one another. Platt claims that Ellison has often publicly boasted about the incident.\n\n2006 Hugo Awards ceremony\n\nEllison was presented with a special committee award at the 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony.  His onstage behavior was bizarre (as seen in the referenced video on YouTube), including sucking on a microphone and culminating in his groping Connie Willis' breast.  Ellison subsequently complained that Willis refused to acknowledge his apology.\n\nLawsuit against Fantagraphics\n\nOn September 20, 2006, Ellison sued comic book and magazine publisher Fantagraphics, stating they had defamed him in their book Comics As Art (We Told You So).Spurgeon, Tom, and Jacob Covey. Comics As Art: We Told You So. Seattle, WA: Fantagraphics, 2006.   The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, The Comics Journal. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him \"bugfuck\" and \"derange-o\". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.\n\nEllison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics's website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal. On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website. No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.\n\nCopyright suits\n\nIn a lawsuit against ABC and Paramount Pictures, Ellison and Ben Bova claimed that a TV series, Future Cop was based on their short story, \"Brillo\", winning a $337,000 judgement.\n\nEllison alleged that James Cameron's film The Terminator drew from material from an episode of the original Outer Limits which Ellison had scripted, \"Soldier\" (1964). Hemdale, the production company and the distributor Orion Pictures, settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and added a credit to the film which acknowledged Ellison's work. Cameron objected to this acknowledgement, and has since labeled Ellison's claim a \"nuisance suit\". Ellison has publicly referred to The Terminator as \"a good film.\" Some accounts of the settlement state that another Outer Limits episode written by Ellison, \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" (also 1964), was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison has explicitly stated that \"'Terminator' was not stolen from 'Demon with a Glass Hand,' it was a ripoff of my OTHER Outer Limits script, 'Soldier.'\"\n\nOn April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the newsgroup \"alt.binaries.e-book\" without authorization. The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ, internet service providers who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the \"Notice and Takedown Procedure\" outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison has initiated legal action or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, \"If you put your hand in my pocket, you'll drag back six inches of bloody stump\".\n\nA lawsuit involving the film In Time (2011), which Ellison contended plagiarizes his short story \"\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman\" (first published in 1965) was withdrawn after Ellison viewed the film.[http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/8810 \"Harlan Ellison Comes Up Empty With 'In Time' Lawsuit\"] December 2, 2011, Airlock Alpha As part of the agreement to dismiss his lawsuit, Ellison agreed that each party would bear its own attorneys' fees.\n\nWorks\n\nNovels and novellas\n\n* Web of the City (1958) (originally published as Rumble)\n* The Man With Nine Lives (1960) (revised and reprinted in 2011 under the author's preferred title The Sound of a Scythe)\n* Spider Kiss (1961) (originally published as Rockabilly)\n* Doomsman (1967) (re-issued under the author's preferred title Way of an Assassin in the collection Rough Beasts)\n* A Boy and His Dog (1969) (made into a film)\n* The Starlost #1: Phoenix Without Ashes (1975) (adaptation by Edward Bryant of Ellison's TV pilot script)\n* All the Lies That Are My Life (1980) (later included in the author's 1980 collection Shatterday)\n* Run for the Stars (1991) (a 1957 novella here republished in a preferred text edition as part of a Tor Double)\n* Mefisto in Onyx (1993) (later included in the author's 1997 collection Slippage)\n\nShort-story collections\n\n* A Touch of Infinity (1958)\n* The Deadly Streets (1958)\n* Sex Gang (1959) (as by Paul Merchant)\n* Children of the Streets (1961) (originally published as The Juvies)\n* Gentleman Junkie and Other Stories of the Hung-Up Generation (1961)\n* Ellison Wonderland (1962) (also published as Earthman, Go Home!)

Occasionally performed at Star Trek conventions, it features an irate writer named \"Arlan Hellison\" who screamed at his producers, \"Art defilers! Script assassins!\"\n\nIn the 1971 novel by Larry Niven and David Gerrold, The Flying Sorcerers, the names and characteristics of the local gods are playful derivatives of those of many science fiction authors and editors. The Ellison reference is \"Elcin\", the tiny god of thunder and lightning—alluding to Ellison's short stature and stormy personality.\n\nBen Bova's 1975 novel The Starcrossed, a roman à clef about Bova and Ellison's experience on The Starlost TV series,[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/starlost_the SF Encyclopedia entry] about The Starlost features a character \"Ron Gabriel\" who is a pastiche of Ellison. Bova's novel is dedicated to Ellison's pseudonym \"Cordwainer Bird\", who was credited as series creator on The Starlost per Ellison's demand. In the novel, \"Ron Gabriel\" requires the fictional series producers to credit him under the pseudonym \"Victor Lawrence Talbot Frankenstein\".Ben Bova, [https://books.google.com/books?&idC1AgAQAAIAAJ&dq\nbova+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22&focussearchwithinvolume&q\n+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22 Laugh Lines] () (collection containing The Starcrossed and some other works), p. 162.\n\nRobert Silverberg named a character in his first novel, Revolt on Alpha C, for Ellison, who was a neighbor of Silverberg in New York at the time he was writing the book. This was confirmed in a special edition on the occasion of Silverberg's 35th year in the business.[http://www.majipoor.com/work.php?id=940 \"Revolt on Alpha C by Robert Silverberg\"]. Majipoor.com: The Works of Robert Silverberg. Jon Davis.\n\nEllison is featured as a recurring character in the 2010 television show Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, where he is plays a fictionalized version of himself portrayed as a professor of literature at the fictional Miskatonic University and colleague of H.P Hatecraft. His writings in speculative fiction give him a unique understanding of alternate timelines and place him in the role of an advisor to the protagonists. The character is voice-acted by Harlan Ellison himself and is reminiscent of Ellison's real-life personality.\n\nEllison appeared as himself in \"Married to the Blob\", a 2014 episode of The Simpsons,Melrose, Kevin (January 9, 2014).

I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1966, Ellison married his third wife, Lory Patrick. The marriage lasted only seven weeks.\n\nIn 1976, he married his fourth wife, Lori Horowitz. He was 41 and she was 19. He said of the marriage, \"I was desperately in love with her, but it was a stupid marriage on my part.\" They were divorced after eight months.\n\nEllison lives in Los Angeles with Susan, his fifth wife, whom he married in 1986. In 1994, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery. Since 2010 (\"the worst, the lowest point in [his] life\"), he also suffers from, and is under treatment for, clinical depression.\n\nOn about October 10, 2014, Ellison suffered a stroke.Melrose, Harlan (October 14, 2014).

He was editor and anthologist for two science fiction anthologies, Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). Ellison has won numerous awards including multiple Hugos, Nebulas and Edgars.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nEllison was born to a Jewish family[http://www.jewishjournal.com/geekheeb/item/top_5_jewish_moments_in_trek_20090507/ Jewish Journal: \"Top 5 Jewish moments in ‘Trek’\" by Adam Wills] May 7, 2009 in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (née Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler.[http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Harlan-Ellison.html \"Harlan Ellison Biography (1934–)\"]. filmreference.com His family subsequently moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home, taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, \"tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina, short-order cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, floorwalker in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House\".\n\nEllison attended The Ohio State University for 18 months (1951–53) before being expelled. He has said the expulsion was for hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability, and over the next twenty or so years he sent that professor a copy of every story he published.\n\nEllison published two stories in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, \"four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator.\"Gentleman Junkie, 14\n\nEllison served in the army from 1957 to 1959.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harlan-Ellison\n\nHollywood and beyond\n\nEllison moved to California in 1962, and subsequently began to sell his writing to Hollywood. He wrote the screenplay for The Oscar, starring Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer. Ellison also sold scripts to many television shows:  The Loretta Young Show (using the name Harlan Ellis),The Flying Nun, Burke's Law, Route 66, The Outer Limits,Keegan, Rebecca (October 5, 2010). The Futurist: The Life and Times of James Cameron, Three Rivers Press (Kindle location 885) Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Cimarron Strip, and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\nEllison's screenplay for the Star Trek episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" has been considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series. \n\nHe participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAlso in 1966, in an article Esquire magazine would later name as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote about the goings-on around the enigmatic Frank Sinatra. The article, entitled \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\", briefly describes a clash between the young Harlan Ellison and Frank Sinatra, when the crooner took exception to Ellison's boots during a billiards game.  Talese wrote of the incident, \"Sinatra probably forgot about it at once, but Ellison will remember it all his life.\"\n\nEllison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios but was fired on his first day after Roy O. Disney overheard him in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters. Ellison recounted this incident in his book Stalking the Nightmare, as part 3 of an essay titled \"The 3 Most Important Things in Life\".\n\nEllison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\" (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (1967) is an allegory of Hell, where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity; the story was the basis of a 1995 computer game; Ellison participated in the game's design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM. Another story, \"A Boy and His Dog\", examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, post-apocalyptic world and was made into the 1975 film of the same name, starring Don Johnson. \n\nEllison served as creative consultant to the 1980s version of  The Twilight Zone science fiction TV series and Babylon 5. As a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), he has voiceover credits for shows including The Pirates of Dark Water, Mother Goose and Grimm, Space Cases, Phantom 2040, and Babylon 5, as well as made an onscreen appearance in the Babylon 5 episode \"The Face of the Enemy\". \n\nEllison's 1992 short story \"The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore\" was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of The Best American Short Stories.Kennison, Katrina and Erdrich, Louise (editors), The Best American Short Stories 1993, New York, 1993.\n\nIn 2014 Ellison made a guest appearance on the album Finding Love in Hell by the stoner metal band Leaving Babylon, reading his piece \"The Silence\" (originally published in Mind Fields) as an introduction to the song \"Dead to Me.\"\n\nEllison and others have maintained his official website (harlanellison.com) for several years, however Ellison himself has not posted there since 2015. \n\nPseudonyms\n \n\nEllison has on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he feels his creative contribution to a project has been mangled beyond repair by others, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also Alan Smithee). The first such work to which he signed the name was \"The Price of Doom\", an episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of Burke's Law (\"Who Killed Alex Debbs?\") credited to Ellison contains a character given this name, played by Sammy Davis, Jr. \n\nThe \"Cordwainer Bird\" moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, Cordwainer Smith. The origin of the word \"cordwainer\" is shoemaker (from working with cordovan leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author. Ellison has said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean \"a shoemaker for birds\". Since he has used the pseudonym mainly for works he wants to distance himself from, it may be understood to mean that \"this work is for the birds\" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of \"the bird\" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled \"Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto\", describing his experience with the Starlost television series). \n\nThe Bird moniker has since become a character in one of Ellison's own stories, not without some prompting. In his book Strange Wine, Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jose Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, the Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in \"The New York Review of Bird,\" in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York Literary Establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of same. \n\nOther pseudonyms Ellison has used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, Harlan Ellis and Jay Solo.\n\nControversies and disputes\n\nTemperament\n\nEllison has a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative. Ellison has generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of his books described him as \"possibly the most contentious person on Earth\". Ellison has filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; as part of a dispute about fulfillment of a contract, he once sent 213 bricks to a publisher postage due, followed by a dead gopher via fourth-class mail.[http://harlanellison.com/text/newsfaq.txt \"alt.fan.harlan-ellison FAQ\" Version 1.5].  James Shearhart (jalmatom@wco.com). Archived at HarlanEllison.com. Last modified November 26, 1995. Retrieved 2012-11-17. In an October 21, 2017 piece in Wired, Ellison was dubbed, \"Sci-Fi's Most Controversial Figure.\"https://www.wired.com/2017/10/geeks-guide-harlan-ellison/\n\nStar Trek\n\nEllison has repeatedly criticized how Star Trek creator and producer Gene Roddenberry (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using \"Cordwainer Bird\" to indicate displeasure (above). \n\nEllison's original script was first published in the 1976 anthology Six Science Fiction Plays, edited by Roger Elwood. Ellison also novelized the story at that time, for the Star Trek Fotonovel series: The City on the Edge of Forever (Bantam Books, 1977, 0-553-11345-3). In 1995, Borderlands Press published The City on the Edge of Forever (), with nearly 300 pages, comprising an essay by Ellison, four versions of the teleplay, and eight \"Afterwords\" contributed by other parties. He greatly expanded the introduction for the paperback edition: Harlan Ellison's The City on the Edge of Forever, White Wolf Publishing, 1996; . It explains what he called a \"fatally inept treatment\". \n\nBoth versions of the script won awards: Ellison's original script won the 1968 Writers Guild Award for best episodic drama in television, while the shooting script won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television, seeking payment of 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison's behalf. On October 23, 2009, Variety magazine reported that a settlement had been reached.\n\nAggiecon I\n\nEllison was among those who in 1968 signed an anti-Vietnam War advertisement in Galaxy Science Fiction. In 1969, Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A&M University's first science fiction convention, Aggiecon, where he reportedly referred to the university's Corps of Cadets as \"... America's next generation of Nazis ...\", inspired in part by the continuing Vietnam War. Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the student body was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison's anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a Denny's because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school's administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year, and no guest of honor was invited for the next two Aggiecons. However, Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for Aggiecon V (1974) and Aggiecon XXXI (2000).\n\nThe Last Dangerous Visions\n\nThe Last Dangerous Visions (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison's anthology series, was originally announced for publication in 1973 but remains unpublished. Nearly 150 writers (many now dead) submitted works for the volume. In 1993, Ellison threatened to sue New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing \"Himself in Anachron\", a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and sold to Ellison for the book by his widow, but later reached an amicable settlement.\n\nBritish science fiction author Christopher Priest criticized Ellison's editorial practices in an article entitled \"The Book on the Edge of Forever\", later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish TLDV within a year of the statement. Priest claims he submitted a story at Ellison's request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by \"Book on the Edge of Forever\" and has, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions since its publication.\n\nI, Robot\n\nShortly after the release of Star Wars (1977), Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot short story collection for Warner Brothers. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warners, Robert Shapiro, Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the \"intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke\". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and published in book form.\nFrom Harlan Ellison's introduction to I Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay,  The 2004 film I, Robot, starring Will Smith, has no connection to Ellison's script.\n\nAllegations of assault on Charles Platt\n\nIn 1984 Ellison allegedly publicly assaulted author and critic Charles Platt at the Nebula Awards banquet. Platt did not pursue legal action against Ellison, and the two men later signed a \"non-aggression pact\", promising never to discuss the incident again nor to have any contact with one another. Platt claims that Ellison has often publicly boasted about the incident.\n\n2006 Hugo Awards ceremony\n\nEllison was presented with a special committee award at the 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony.  His onstage behavior was bizarre (as seen in the referenced video on YouTube), including sucking on a microphone and culminating in his groping Connie Willis' breast.  Ellison subsequently complained that Willis refused to acknowledge his apology.\n\nLawsuit against Fantagraphics\n\nOn September 20, 2006, Ellison sued comic book and magazine publisher Fantagraphics, stating they had defamed him in their book Comics As Art (We Told You So).Spurgeon, Tom, and Jacob Covey. Comics As Art: We Told You So. Seattle, WA: Fantagraphics, 2006.   The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, The Comics Journal. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him \"bugfuck\" and \"derange-o\". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.\n\nEllison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics's website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal. On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website. No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.\n\nCopyright suits\n\nIn a lawsuit against ABC and Paramount Pictures, Ellison and Ben Bova claimed that a TV series, Future Cop was based on their short story, \"Brillo\", winning a $337,000 judgement.\n\nEllison alleged that James Cameron's film The Terminator drew from material from an episode of the original Outer Limits which Ellison had scripted, \"Soldier\" (1964). Hemdale, the production company and the distributor Orion Pictures, settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and added a credit to the film which acknowledged Ellison's work. Cameron objected to this acknowledgement, and has since labeled Ellison's claim a \"nuisance suit\". Ellison has publicly referred to The Terminator as \"a good film.\" Some accounts of the settlement state that another Outer Limits episode written by Ellison, \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" (also 1964), was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison has explicitly stated that \"'Terminator' was not stolen from 'Demon with a Glass Hand,' it was a ripoff of my OTHER Outer Limits script, 'Soldier.'\"\n\nOn April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the newsgroup \"alt.binaries.e-book\" without authorization. The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ, internet service providers who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the \"Notice and Takedown Procedure\" outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison has initiated legal action or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, \"If you put your hand in my pocket, you'll drag back six inches of bloody stump\".\n\nA lawsuit involving the film In Time (2011), which Ellison contended plagiarizes his short story \"\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman\" (first published in 1965) was withdrawn after Ellison viewed the film.[http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/8810 \"Harlan Ellison Comes Up Empty With 'In Time' Lawsuit\"] December 2, 2011, Airlock Alpha As part of the agreement to dismiss his lawsuit, Ellison agreed that each party would bear its own attorneys' fees.\n\nWorks\n\nNovels and novellas\n\n* Web of the City (1958) (originally published as Rumble)\n* The Man With Nine Lives (1960) (revised and reprinted in 2011 under the author's preferred title The Sound of a Scythe)\n* Spider Kiss (1961) (originally published as Rockabilly)\n* Doomsman (1967) (re-issued under the author's preferred title Way of an Assassin in the collection Rough Beasts)\n* A Boy and His Dog (1969) (made into a film)\n* The Starlost #1: Phoenix Without Ashes (1975) (adaptation by Edward Bryant of Ellison's TV pilot script)\n* All the Lies That Are My Life (1980) (later included in the author's 1980 collection Shatterday)\n* Run for the Stars (1991) (a 1957 novella here republished in a preferred text edition as part of a Tor Double)\n* Mefisto in Onyx (1993) (later included in the author's 1997 collection Slippage)\n\nShort-story collections\n\n* A Touch of Infinity (1958)\n* The Deadly Streets (1958)\n* Sex Gang (1959) (as by Paul Merchant)\n* Children of the Streets (1961) (originally published as The Juvies)\n* Gentleman Junkie and Other Stories of the Hung-Up Generation (1961)\n* Ellison Wonderland (1962) (also published as Earthman, Go Home!)

Script assassins!\"\n\nIn the 1971 novel by Larry Niven and David Gerrold, The Flying Sorcerers, the names and characteristics of the local gods are playful derivatives of those of many science fiction authors and editors.

Bova's novel is dedicated to Ellison's pseudonym \"Cordwainer Bird\", who was credited as series creator on The Starlost per Ellison's demand. In the novel, \"Ron Gabriel\" requires the fictional series producers to credit him under the pseudonym \"Victor Lawrence Talbot Frankenstein\".Ben Bova, [https://books.google.com/books?&idC1AgAQAAIAAJ&dq\nbova+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22&focussearchwithinvolume&q\n+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22 Laugh Lines] () (collection containing The Starcrossed and some other works), p. 162.\n\nRobert Silverberg named a character in his first novel, Revolt on Alpha C, for Ellison, who was a neighbor of Silverberg in New York at the time he was writing the book.

Majipoor.com: The Works of Robert Silverberg. Jon Davis.\n\nEllison is featured as a recurring character in the 2010 television show Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, where he is plays a fictionalized version of himself portrayed as a professor of literature at the fictional Miskatonic University and colleague of H.P Hatecraft. His writings in speculative fiction give him a unique understanding of alternate timelines and place him in the role of an advisor to the protagonists. The character is voice-acted by Harlan Ellison himself and is reminiscent of Ellison's real-life personality.\n\nEllison appeared as himself in \"Married to the Blob\", a 2014 episode of The Simpsons,Melrose, Kevin (January 9, 2014).

I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1966, Ellison married his third wife, Lory Patrick. The marriage lasted only seven weeks.\n\nIn 1976, he married his fourth wife, Lori Horowitz. He was 41 and she was 19. He said of the marriage, \"I was desperately in love with her, but it was a stupid marriage on my part.\" They were divorced after eight months.\n\nEllison lives in Los Angeles with Susan, his fifth wife, whom he married in 1986. In 1994, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery. Since 2010 (\"the worst, the lowest point in [his] life\"), he also suffers from, and is under treatment for, clinical depression.\n\nOn about October 10, 2014, Ellison suffered a stroke.Melrose, Harlan (October 14, 2014).
