  "textBody" : "John Hoyer Updike (March 18, 1932 – January 27, 2009) was an American novelist, poet, short story writer, art critic, and literary critic. One of only three writers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others were Booth Tarkington and William Faulkner), Updike published more than twenty novels, more than a dozen short-story collections, as well as poetry, art and literary criticism and children's books during his career.\n\nHundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in The New Yorker starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for The New York Review of Books. His most famous work is his \"Rabbit\" series (the novels Rabbit, Run; Rabbit Redux; Rabbit Is Rich; Rabbit at Rest; and the novella Rabbit Remembered), which chronicles the life of the middle-class everyman Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom over the course of several decades, from young adulthood to death. Both Rabbit Is Rich (1982) and Rabbit at Rest (1990) were recognized with the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nDescribing his subject as \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", Updike was recognized for his careful craftsmanship, his unique prose style, and his prolific outputhe wrote on average a book a year. Updike populated his fiction with characters who \"frequently experience personal turmoil and must respond to crises relating to religion, family obligations, and marital infidelity\"..\n\nHis fiction is distinguished by its attention to the concerns, passions, and suffering of average Americans, its emphasis on Christian theology, and its preoccupation with sexuality and sensual detail. His work has attracted significant critical attention and praise, and he is widely considered one of the great American writers of his time. Updike's highly distinctive prose style features a rich, unusual, sometimes arcane vocabulary as conveyed through the eyes of \"a wry, intelligent authorial voice\" that describes the physical world extravagantly while remaining squarely in the realist tradition.. He described his style as an attempt \"to give the mundane its beautiful due\"..\n\nEarly life and education\n\nUpdike was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the only child of Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington.[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/upd0bio-1 \"John Updike Biography\"] . Academy of Achievement.  Retrieved 30 January 2010. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's attempts to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. \"One of my earliest memories\", he later recalled, \"is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper.  And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in.\"\n\nThese early years in Berks County, Pennsylvania, would influence the environment of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, as well as many of his early novels and short stories. Updike graduated from Shillington High School as co-valedictorian and class president in 1950 and received a full scholarship to Harvard College, where he was the roommate of Christopher Lasch during their freshman year.Lasch, Christopher. Plain Style : A Guide to Written English. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 6. Updike had already received recognition for his writing as a teenager by winning a Scholastic Art & Writing Award,Scholastic Inc. Art & Writing Awards, Alumni, http://www.artandwriting.org/who-we-are/alumni/ and at Harvard he soon became well known among his classmates as a talented and prolific contributor to The Harvard Lampoon, of which he served as president. He graduated summa cum laude in 1954 with a degree in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society.Boswell, Marshall. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rectrue&UID\n4502 \"John Updike\"], The Literary Encyclopedia, March 18, 2004\n\nUpon graduation, Updike attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at the University of Oxford with the ambition of becoming a cartoonist.. After returning to the United States, Updike and his family moved to New York, where he became a regular contributor to The New Yorker. This was the beginning of his professional writing career.\n\nCareer as a writer\n\n1950s\n\nUpdike stayed at The New Yorker as a full staff writer for only two years, writing \"Talk of the Town\" columns and submitting poetry and short stories to the magazine. In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like The Carpentered Hen (1958) and The Same Door (1959). These works were influenced by Updike's early engagement with The New Yorker. This early work also featured the influence of J. D. Salinger (\"A&P\"); John Cheever (\"Snowing in Greenwich Village\"); and the Modernists Marcel Proust, Henry Green, James Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nDuring this time, Updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis.  Suffering from a loss of religious faith, he began reading Søren Kierkegaard and the theologian Karl Barth. Both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs, which in turn figured prominently in his fiction. Updike remained a believing Christian for the rest of his life..\n\n1960s–1970s\n\nLater, Updike and his family relocated to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Many commentators, including a columnist in the local Ipswich Chronicle, asserted that the fictional town of Tarbox in Couples was based on Ipswich. Updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper.The Ipswich Chronicle. 25 April 1968. Letter: \"Updike 'flatly denies' that Tarbox is Ipswich.\" Impressions of Updike's day-to-day life in Ipswich during the 1960s and 1970s are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after Updike's death and written by a friend and contemporary. In Ipswich, Updike wrote Rabbit, Run (1960), on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and The Centaur (1963), two of his most acclaimed and famous works; the latter won the National Book Award.\n\nRabbit, Run featured Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become Updike's most enduring and critically acclaimed character. Updike wrote three additional novels about him. Rabbit, Run was featured in Times All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/ All-Time 100 Novels]\n\nShort stories\n\nUpdike's career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with The New Yorker, which published him frequently throughout his career, despite the fact that he had departed the magazine's employment after only two years. Updike's memoir indicates that he stayed in his \"corner of New England to give its domestic news\" with a focus on the American home from the point of view of a male writer.Gross, Terry (2004).  Being square.  All I did was ask:  Conversations with writers, actors, musicians, and artists (p. 24).  New York, NY:  Hyperion. Updike's contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts, but William Shawn, The New Yorker's editor from 1952 to 1987, rejected several as too explicit.\n\nThe Maple short stories, collected in Too Far To Go (1979), reflected the ebb and flow of Updike's first marriage; \"Separating\" (1974) and \"Here Come the Maples\" (1976) related to his divorce. These stories also reflect the role of alcohol in 1970s America.Donahue, Peter. \"Pouring Drinks and Getting Drunk: The Social and Personal Implications of Drinking in John Updike's Too Far to Go.\" Studies in Short Fiction 33.3 (1996): (p. 362). Ebscohost. Web. 22 Mar. 2017 They were the basis for the television movie also called Too Far To Go, broadcast by NBC in 1979.\n\nUpdike's short stories were collected in several volumes published by Alfred A. Knopf over five decades. In 2013, the Library of America issued a two-volume boxed edition of 186 stories under the title The Collected Stories.https://www.loa.org/books/391-the-collected-stories-boxed-set Retrieved 14 March 2017\n\nNovels\n\nIn 1971, Updike published a sequel to Rabbit, Run called Rabbit Redux, his response to the 1960s; Rabbit reflected much of Updike's confusion and ambivalence towards the social and political changes that beset the United States during that time.[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6584 Charlie Rose]  interview, 24 October 1995\n\nUpdike's early Olinger period was set in the Pennsylvania of his youth; it ended around 1965 with the lyrical Of the Farm.\n\nAfter his early novels, Updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity, adultery, and marital unrest, especially in suburban America; and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores.\n[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2009/01/updike-john-mortimer-rabbit \"Farewell, King John of Suburbia\"], New Statesman, 29 January 2009 He once wrote that it was \"a subject which, if I have not exhausted, has exhausted me\". The most prominent of Updike's novels of this vein is Couples (1968), a novel about adultery in a small fictional Massachusetts town called Tarbox. It garnered Updike an appearance on the cover of Time magazine with the headline \"The Adulterous Society\". Both the magazine article and, to an extent, the novel struck a chord of national concern over whether American society was abandoning all social standards of conduct in sexual matters.\n\nThe Coup (1978), a lauded[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1978/dec/21/updike-le-noir/ Updike le Noir | by John Thompson | The New York Review of Books] novel about an African dictatorship inspired by a visit he made to Africa, found Updike working in new territory.\n\n1980s–2000s\n\nIn 1980, he published another novel featuring Harry Angstrom, Rabbit Is Rich, which won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—all three major American literary prizes. The novel found \"Rabbit the fat and happy owner of a Toyota dealership.\" Updike found it difficult to end the book, because he was \"having so much fun\" in the imaginary county Rabbit and his family inhabited.\n\nAfter writing Rabbit Is Rich, Updike published The Witches of Eastwick (1984), a playful novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He described it as an attempt to \"make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors\".Michiko Kakutani, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/books/20kaku.html?_r1&ref\nbooks&oref=slogin Books of the Times: 'The Widows of Eastwick]'\", New York Times, 19 October 2008 One of Updike's most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom's list of canonical 20th-century literature (in The Western Canon).Harold Bloom, The Western Canon: The Books and Schools of the Ages (1994), \"The Chaotic Age: The United States,\" Riverhead Trade. In 2008 Updike published The Widows of Eastwick, a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.\n\nIn 1986, he published the unconventional novel Roger's Version, the second volume of the so-called Scarlet Letter trilogy, about an attempt to prove God's existence using a computer program. Author and critic Martin Amis called it a \"near-masterpiece\".Martin Amis, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/john-updike-interview-amis-martin When Amis met Updike ...]\", The Guardian, 1 February 2009 The novel S. (1989), uncharacteristically featuring a female protagonist, concluded Updike's reworking of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter.\n\nUpdike enjoyed working in series; in addition to the Rabbit novels and the Maples stories, a recurrent Updike alter ego is the moderately well-known, unprolific Jewish novelist and eventual Nobel laureate Henry Bech, chronicled in three comic short-story cycles: Bech, a Book (1970), Bech Is Back (1981) and Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel (1998). These stories were compiled as The Complete Henry Bech (2001) by Everyman's Library. Bech is a comical and self-conscious antithesis of Updike's own literary persona: Jewish, a World War II veteran, reclusive, and unprolific to a fault.Jack De Bellis (ed.), The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), \"Bech, Henry\", pp. 52–53.\n\nIn 1990, he published the last Rabbit novel, Rabbit at Rest, in which his main character died. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike's most celebrated. In 2000, Updike included the novella Rabbit Remembered in his collection Licks of Love, drawing the Rabbit saga to a close. His Pulitzers for the last two Rabbit novels make Updike one of only three writers to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, the others being William Faulkner and Booth Tarkington.\n\nIn 1995, Everyman's Library collected and canonized the four novels as the omnibus Rabbit Angstrom; Updike wrote an introduction in which he described Rabbit as \"a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight.\"John Updike, \"Introduction\", Rabbit Angstrom (1995), Everyman's Library. Updike later called Rabbit \"a brother to me, and a good friend. He opened me up as a writer.\", 1996\n\nAfter the publication of Rabbit at Rest, Updike spent the rest of the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of Memories of the Ford Administration (1992), the magical realism of Brazil (1994), the science fiction of Toward the End of Time (1997), the postmodernism of Gertrude and Claudius (2000), and the experimental fiction of Seek My Face (2002).\n\nIn the midst of these, he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel, In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996), a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in America. It is considered the most successful novel of Updike's late career. Some critics have predicted that posterity may consider the novel a \"late masterpiece overlooked or praised by rote in its day, only to be rediscovered by another generation\",Adam Gopnik, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/02/09/090209ta_talk_gopnik Postscript: John Updike]\", The New Yorker, 9 February 2009 while others thought it overlong and depressing. In Villages (2004), Updike returned to the familiar territory of infidelities in New England. His 22nd novel, Terrorist (2006), the story of a fervent young extremist Muslim in New Jersey, garnered media attention but little critical praise.\n\nIn 2003, Updike published The Early Stories, a large collection of his short fiction spanning the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. More than 800 pages long, with over one hundred stories, it has been called \"a richly episodic and lyrical Bildungsroman ... in which Updike traces the trajectory from adolescence, college, married life, fatherhood, separation and divorce\". It won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2004.[http://www.powells.com/prizes/penfaulkner_fiction.html Award Winners—The PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction] . Powell's Books, Powells.com This lengthy volume nevertheless excluded several stories found in his short-story collections of the same period.\n\nUpdike worked in a wide array of genres, including fiction, poetry (most of it compiled in Collected Poems: 1953–1993, 1993), essays (collected in nine separate volumes), a play (Buchanan Dying, 1974), and a memoir (Self-Consciousness, 1989).\n\nUpdike's array of awards includes two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, two National Book Awards, three National Book Critics Circle awards, the 1989 National Medal of Arts, the 2003 National Humanities Medal, and the Rea Award for the Short Story for outstanding achievement. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Updike to present the 2008 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government's highest humanities honor; Updike's lecture was titled \"The Clarity of Things: What Is American about American Art\".\n\nAt the end of his life, Updike was working on a novel about St. Paul and early Christianity.[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/06/updikes-roots-and-evolution/ Updike’s roots and evolution | Harvard Gazette] Upon his death, The New Yorker published an appreciation by Adam Gopnik of Updike's lifetime association with the magazine, calling him \"one of the greatest of all modern writers, the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing\".\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nUpdike married Mary E. Pennington, an art student at Radcliffe College, in 1953, while he was still a student at Harvard. She accompanied him to Oxford, England, where he attended art school and where their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1955. The couple had three more children together: writer David (born 1957), artist Michael (born 1959) and Miranda (born 1960). They divorced in 1974. Updike had seven grandsons, Anoff, Kwame, Wesley, Trevor, Kai, Sawyer and Seneca.\n\nIn 1977 Updike married Martha Ruggles Bernhard, with whom he lived for more than thirty years in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. He died of lung cancer at a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, on January 27, 2009, at the age of 76.Ancestry.com. Social Security Death Index [database on-line].

Social Security Administration.\n\nPoetry\n\nUpdike published eight volumes of poetry over his career, including his first book The Carpentered Hen (1958), and one of his last, the posthumous Endpoint (2009). The New Yorker published excerpts of Endpoint in its 16 March 2009 issue.  Much of Updike's poetical output was recollected in Knopf's Collected Poems (1993). He wrote that \"I began as a writer of light verse, and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form.\"[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id\n81868 John Updike: The Poetry Foundation, archive] The poet Thomas M. Disch noted that because Updike was such a well-known novelist, his poetry \"could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible\"; Disch saw Updike's light verse instead as a poetry of \"epigrammatical lucidity\".[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/660 Poets.org: John Updike] His poetry has been praised for its engagement with \"a variety of forms and topics\", its \"wit and precision\", and for its depiction of topics familiar to American readers.\n\nBritish poet Gavin Ewart praised Updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability \"to make the ordinary seem strange\", and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry.Gavin Ewart, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/06/lifetimes/updike-facingnature.html Making it strange]\", New York Times, 28 April 1985 Reading Endpoint aloud, the critic Charles McGrath claimed that he found \"another, deeper music\" in Updike's poetry, finding that Updike's wordplay \"smooths and elides itself\" and has many subtle \"sound effects\".Charles McGrath, \"[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/reading-updikes-last-words-aloud/?ref=books Reading Updike's Last Words, Aloud]\", New York Times, 3 April 2009 John Keenan, who praised the collection Endpoint as \"beautiful and poignant\", noted that his poetry's engagement with \"the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him\".John Keenan, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/mar/12/updike-poetry-endpoint The clarity of Updike's poetry should not obscure its class]\", The Guardian, 12 March 2009\n\nLiterary criticism and art criticism\n\nUpdike was also a critic of literature and art, one frequently cited as one of the best American critics of his generation.James Atlas, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n02/atla01_.html Towards the Transhuman]\", London Review of Books, 2 February 1984 In the introduction to Picked-Up Pieces, his 1975 collection of prose, he listed his personal rules for literary criticism:\n\n1. Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt.\n\n2. Give enough direct quotation—at least one extended passage—of the book's prose so the review's reader can form his own impression, can get his own taste.\n\n3. Confirm your description of the book with quotation from the book, if only phrase-long, rather than proceeding by fuzzy précis.\n\n4. Go easy on plot summary, and do not give away the ending.\n\n5. If the book is judged deficient, cite a successful example along the same lines, from the author's œuvre or elsewhere. Try to understand the failure. Sure it's his and not yours?\n\nTo these concrete five might be added a vaguer sixth, having to do with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never ... try to put the author \"in his place,\" making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.\"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/ Remembering Updike: The Gospel According to John]\", New Yorker online\n\nHe reviewed \"nearly every major writer of the 20th century and some 19th-century authors\", typically in The New Yorker, always trying to make his reviews \"animated.\" He also championed young writers, comparing them to his own literary heroes including Vladimir Nabokov and Marcel Proust.ZZ Packer, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/index.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online Good reviews from Updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales; some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as Erica Jong, Thomas Mallon and Jonathan Safran Foer.Charles McGrath, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/weekinreview/01mcgrath.html John Updike's Mighty Pen]\", New York Times, 31 January 2009\n\nBad reviews by Updike sometimes caused controversy,Alex Carnevale, \"[http://gawker.com/5069587/toni-morrison-is-john-updikes-latest-lit+fit-victim Literary Feuds: Toni Morrison is John Updike's Latest Lit-Fit Victim]\", October 2008, Gawker.com as when in late 2008 he gave a \"damning\" review of Toni Morrison's novel A Mercy.\"[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1565,updike-takes-a-swipe-at-toni-morrison,52615 Updike takes a swipe at Toni Morrison]\", The First Post, 29 October 2008John Updike, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/11/03/081103crbo_books_updike Dreamy Wilderness]\", New Yorker, 3 November 2008\n\nUpdike was praised for his literary criticism's conventional simplicity and profundity, for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms, and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism.Wyatt Mason, \"[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/12/0081837 Among the reviewers: John Updike and the book-review bugaboo]\", Harper's, December 2007\n\nMuch of Updike's art criticism appeared in The New York Review of Books, where he often wrote about American art.[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/158 \"John Updike\"].

The American artist, first born into a continent without museums and art schools, took Nature as his only instructor, and things as his principal study. A bias toward the empirical, toward the evidential object in the numinous fullness of its being, leads to a certain lininess, as the artist intently maps the visible in a New World that feels surrounded by chaos and emptiness.\n\nCritical reputation and style\n\nUpdike is considered one of the greatest American fiction writers of his generation.\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/books/fiction-25-years.html What Is the Best Work of American Fiction of the Last 25 Years?]\" New York Times, 21 May 2006, \"a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages\" listed the Rabbit series as one of the few greatest works of modern American fiction.

Some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault, questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes, while others criticized Updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships.\n\nOther critics argue that Updike's \"dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader\". On the whole, however, Updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres, wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style, with \"shrewd insight into the sorrows, frustrations, and banality of American life\".\n\nUpdike's character Rabbit Angstrom, the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his magnum opus, has been said to have \"entered the pantheon of signal American literary figures\", along with Huckleberry Finn, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield and others.Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/books/28updike.html?pagewanted\n2&ref=books John Updike, a Lyrical Writer of the Middle Class, Dies at 76]\", New York Times, 28 January 2009 A 2002 list by Book magazine of the 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 listed Rabbit in the top five.Book magazine, March/April 2002, \"[http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html 100 Best Fictional Characters since 1900]\", via NPR The Rabbit novels, the Henry Bech stories, and the Maples stories have been canonized by Everyman's Library.[http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/classics/authors.html \"Everyman's Library: Authors\"], Random House\n\nAfter Updike's death, Harvard's Houghton Library acquired his papers, manuscripts, and letters, naming the collection the John Updike Archive.Tracy Jan, \"[http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2009/10/07/harvard_buys_updike_archive/ Harvard buys Updike archive]\", Boston Globe, 7 October 2009 2009 also saw the founding of the John Updike Society,[http://blogs.iwu.edu/johnupdikesociety/ \"The John Updike Society Homepage\"].

Retrieved 9 December 2009.\n\nEulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist Ian McEwan wrote that Updike's \"literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the Shakespearean\", and that Updike's death marked \"the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century's second half.\"\n\nMcEwan said the Rabbit series is Updike's \"masterpiece and will surely be his monument\", and concluded:\nUpdike is a master of effortless motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.\n\nThis is at the heart of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an exercise in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, \"and not chop them down to what you think is the right size.\"Ian McEwan, \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22391 On John Updike]\", New York Review of Books Vol 56 No 4, 12 March 2009\n\nJonathan Raban, highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to Updike's prose, called Rabbit at Rest \"one of the very few modern novels in English ... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, and not feel the draft ... It is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details, of shades and nuances, of the byplay between one sentence and the next, and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness.\"Jonathan Raban, The Oxford Book of the Sea (1993), Oxford University Press, pp. 509–517.\n\nThe novelist Philip Roth, considered one of Updike's chief literary rivals,\"[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/updike/appreciation.html John Updike: 2008 Jefferson Lecture] \", National Endowment for the Humanities wrote, \"John Updike is our time's greatest man of letters, as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer. He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"\n\nThe noted critic James Wood called Updike \"a prose writer of great beauty, but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough, and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey\".James Wood, The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief (2000), \"John Updike's Complacent God\", Modern Library, pp. 192. In a review of Licks of Love (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's \"prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons\" but that there often exists in his work a \"hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview\". Wood both praised and criticized Updike's language for having \"an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract\". According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing \"the perfect sentence\" and his style is characterized by a \"delicate deferral\" of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of that language floats above reality, Wood wrote: For some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books—here extended a further instance—suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us—'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed—and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.James Wood, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n08/wood02_.html Gossip in Gilt]\", London Review of Books, 19 April 2001\n\nIn direct contrast to Wood's evaluation, the Oxford critic Thomas Karshan asserted that Updike is \"intensely intellectual\", with a style that constitutes his \"manner of thought\" not merely \"a set of dainty curlicues\". Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the \"traditional role of the epic writer\". According to Karshan, \"Updike's writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child.\"\n\nDisagreeing with Wood's critique of Updike's alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike's language as convincingly naturalistic:\nUpdike's sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith. Rather, like Proust's sentences in Updike's description, they \"seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith.\" Updike aspires to \"this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that Cézanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs.\" Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world. But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them.\n\nHarold Bloom once called Updike \"a minor novelist with a major style. A quite beautiful and very considerable stylist ... He specializes in the easier pleasures.\"Richard Eder, \"The Paris Interviews\", New York Times, 25 December 2007. Bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on Updike in 1987, in which he concluded that Updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are \"beyond praise\"; nevertheless, Bloom went on, \"the American sublime will never touch his pages\".Harold Bloom, ed., Modern Critical Views of John Updike, \"Introduction,\" Chelsea House, New York, 1987.\n\nOn The Dick Cavett Show in 1981, the novelist and short-story writer John Cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review Rabbit Is Rich. He replied:\nThe reason I didn't review the book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My appreciation of it is that diverse and that complicated ... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.Dick Cavett, \"[http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/writers-bloc-when-updike-and-cheever-came-to-visit/?apage=5 Writers Bloc: When Updike and Cheever Came to Visit]\", New York Times, 13 February 2009. Video 14 October 1981\n\nThe Fiction Circus, an online and multimedia literary magazine, called Updike one of the \"four Great American Novelists\" of his time along with Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo, each jokingly represented as a sign of the Zodiac. Furthermore, Updike was seen as the \"best prose writer in the world\", like Nabokov before him. But in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries, the Circus asserted that nobody \"thought of Updike as a vital writer.\"S. Future, \"[http://fictioncircus.com/news.php?id280&mode\none Updike]\", The Fiction Circus, 27 January 2009,\n\nAdam Gopnik of The New Yorker evaluated Updike as \"the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing ... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction—the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite to get it all in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly—were both alive in him.\"\n\nThe critic James Wolcott, in a review of Updike's last novel, The Widows of Eastwick (2008), noted that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an affirmation of America's ultimate merits: \"Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden dab of sperm.\"James Wolcott, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/wolc01_.html Caretaker/Pallbearer]\", London Review of Books, 1 January 2009\n\nGore Vidal, in a controversial essay in the Times Literary Supplement, professed to have \"never taken Updike seriously as a writer\". He criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its \"blandness and acceptance of authority in any form\". He concludes that Updike \"describes to no purpose\". In reference to Updike's wide establishment acclaim, Vidal mockingly called him \"our good child\" and excoriated his alleged political conservatism. Vidal ultimately concluded, \"Updike's work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where Authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up.\"Gore Vidal, \"[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5610640.ece Rabbit's own burrow]\", Times Literary Supplement, 26 April 1996\n\nRobert B.

[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99921377 Robert B. Silvers interview for NPR Remembrances: \"John Updike: The Shy Man And Great Writer\"]. NPR, Day to Day, 27 January 2009\n\nThe short-story writer Lorrie Moore, who once described Updike as \"American literature's greatest short story writer ... and arguably our greatest writer\",Mary Rourke, \"[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-updike28-2009jan28,0,3942596.story John Updike dies at 76; Pulitzer-winning author]\", Los Angeles Times, 28 January 2009 reviewed Updike's body of short stories in The New York Review, praising their intricate detail and rich imagery: \"his eye and his prose never falter, even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his story's way\".Lorrie Moore, \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16794 Home Truths]\", New York Review of Books, 20 November 2003\n\nIn a post commemorating his birthday in 2011, blogger and literary critic Christy Potter called Updike \"... THE Writer, the kind of writer everyone has heard of, the one whose name you can bring up at a party and people who have never read one thing he wrote will still nod their heads knowingly and say, 'Oh yes, John Updike. The writer.'\"Potter, Christy. Unraveling the Mysterious Appeal of John Updike. http://www.ChristytheWriter.com/?p=2611, 2011\n\nDuring November 2008 the editors of the UK's Literary Review magazine awarded Updike their Bad Sex in Fiction Lifetime Achievement Award, which celebrates \"crude, tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature\".\n\nThemes\n\nThe principal themes in Updike's work are religion, sex, and AmericaThe Economist, \"[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id13014056 An American subversive]\", 29 January 2009 as well as death.Jack De Bellis (ed.), \"Mortality and Immortality\", The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), pp. 286. See here for many subsequent quotes and citations on death. Often he would combine them, frequently in his favored terrain of \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", of which he once said, \"I like middles. It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.\"\n\nFor example, the decline of religion in America is chronicled in In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996) alongside the history of cinema, and Rabbit Angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend Reverend Jack Eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in Rabbit, Run (1960).\n\nCritics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.\n\nDescribing his purpose in writing prose, Updike himself, in the introduction to his Early Stories: 1953–1975 (2004), wrote that his aim was always \"to give the mundane its beautiful due.\" Elsewhere he famously said, \"When I write, I aim my mind not towards New York but towards a vague spot east of Kansas.\"Robert McCrun, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/john-updike-literary-generation John Updike was of a generation that changed the literary landscape irrevocably],\" The Guardian, 1 February 2009 Some have suggested that the \"best statement of Updike's aesthetic comes in his early memoir 'The Dogwood Tree'\" (1962): \"Blankness is not emptiness; we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else. And in fact there is a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.\"John Updike, \"The Dogwood Tree\", Assorted Prose (1965), Knopf.\n\nSex\n\nSex in Updike's work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it:\n\nThe critic Edward Champion notes that Updike's prose heavily favors \"external sexual imagery\" rife with \"explicit anatomical detail\" rather than descriptions of \"internal emotion\" in descriptions of sex.The Bat Segundo Show, [http://www.edrants.com/segundo/the-bat-segundo-show-50/ Show #50, John Updike] In Champion's interview with Updike on The Bat Segundo Show, Updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex \"real\" in his prose. Another sexual theme commonly addressed in Updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in Couples (1968). The Updikean narrator is often \"a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family.\"Antonya Nelson, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/2.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online\n\nUnited States\n\nSimilarly, Updike wrote about America with a certain nostalgia, reverence, and recognition and celebration of America's broad diversity. ZZ Packer wrote that in Updike, \"there seemed a strange ability to harken both America the Beautiful as well as America the Plain Jane, and the lovely Protestant backbone in his fiction and essays, when he decided to show it off, was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic.\"ZZ Packer, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online\n\nThe Rabbit novels in particular can be viewed, according to Julian Barnes, as \"a distraction from, and a glittering confirmation of, the vast bustling ordinariness of American life.\"Julian Barnes, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/2.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online But as Updike celebrated ordinary America, he also alluded to its decline: at times, he was \"so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of America.\"Jack De Bellis (ed.), \"More Matter\", The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), pp. 281. Adam Gopnik concludes that \"Updike's great subject was the American attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture. He documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and Toyotas and family love and family obligation. For Updike, this effort was blessed, and very nearly successful.\"\n\nUpdike's novels about America almost always contain references to political events of the time. In this sense, they are artifacts of their historical eras, showing how national leaders shape and define their times. The lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background.\n\nDeath\n\nUpdike often wrote about death, his characters providing a \"mosaic of reactions\" to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In The Poorhouse Fair (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, \"There is no goodness without belief... And if you have not believed, at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next\", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.\n\nFor Rabbit Angstrom, with his constant musings on mortality, his near-witnessing of his daughter's death, and his often shaky faith, death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications. At the end of Rabbit at Rest (1990), though, Rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty, telling his son Nelson on his deathbed, \"...But enough. Maybe. Enough.\" In The Centaur (1963), George Caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer. Death can also be a sort of unseen terror; it \"occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence.\"\n\nUpdike himself also experienced a \"crisis over the afterlife\", and indeed \"many of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man: Henry Bech's concern that he was 'a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust,' or Colonel Ellelloû's lament that 'we will be forgotten, all of us forgotten.' Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God—looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with 'its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.'\". Updike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings, including the poem \"Perfection Wasted\" (1990):\nAnd another regrettable thing about death\nis the ceasing of your own brand of magic....\n\nIn popular culture \n\n* Updike was featured on the cover of Time twice, on 26 April 1968 and again on 18 October 1982.[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/photocredit/achievers/upd0-006 26 April 1968 Time cover] , [http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/photocredit/achievers/upd0-007 18 October 1982 Time cover] \n* Updike was the subject of a \"closed book examination\" by Nicholson Baker, titled U and I (1991).

    "aggregatedText" : "John Hoyer Updike (March 18, 1932 – January 27, 2009) was an American novelist, poet, short story writer, art critic, and literary critic. One of only three writers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others were Booth Tarkington and William Faulkner), Updike published more than twenty novels, more than a dozen short-story collections, as well as poetry, art and literary criticism and children's books during his career.\n\nHundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in The New Yorker starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for The New York Review of Books. His most famous work is his \"Rabbit\" series (the novels Rabbit, Run; Rabbit Redux; Rabbit Is Rich; Rabbit at Rest; and the novella Rabbit Remembered), which chronicles the life of the middle-class everyman Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom over the course of several decades, from young adulthood to death. Both Rabbit Is Rich (1982) and Rabbit at Rest (1990) were recognized with the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nDescribing his subject as \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", Updike was recognized for his careful craftsmanship, his unique prose style, and his prolific outputhe wrote on average a book a year. Updike populated his fiction with characters who \"frequently experience personal turmoil and must respond to crises relating to religion, family obligations, and marital infidelity\"..\n\nHis fiction is distinguished by its attention to the concerns, passions, and suffering of average Americans, its emphasis on Christian theology, and its preoccupation with sexuality and sensual detail. His work has attracted significant critical attention and praise, and he is widely considered one of the great American writers of his time. Updike's highly distinctive prose style features a rich, unusual, sometimes arcane vocabulary as conveyed through the eyes of \"a wry, intelligent authorial voice\" that describes the physical world extravagantly while remaining squarely in the realist tradition.. He described his style as an attempt \"to give the mundane its beautiful due\"..\n\nEarly life and education\n\nUpdike was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the only child of Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington.[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/upd0bio-1 \"John Updike Biography\"] . Academy of Achievement.  Retrieved 30 January 2010. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's attempts to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. \"One of my earliest memories\", he later recalled, \"is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper.  And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in.\"\n\nThese early years in Berks County, Pennsylvania, would influence the environment of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, as well as many of his early novels and short stories. Updike graduated from Shillington High School as co-valedictorian and class president in 1950 and received a full scholarship to Harvard College, where he was the roommate of Christopher Lasch during their freshman year.Lasch, Christopher. Plain Style : A Guide to Written English. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 6. Updike had already received recognition for his writing as a teenager by winning a Scholastic Art & Writing Award,Scholastic Inc. Art & Writing Awards, Alumni, http://www.artandwriting.org/who-we-are/alumni/ and at Harvard he soon became well known among his classmates as a talented and prolific contributor to The Harvard Lampoon, of which he served as president. He graduated summa cum laude in 1954 with a degree in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society.Boswell, Marshall.

After returning to the United States, Updike and his family moved to New York, where he became a regular contributor to The New Yorker. This was the beginning of his professional writing career.\n\nCareer as a writer\n\n1950s\n\nUpdike stayed at The New Yorker as a full staff writer for only two years, writing \"Talk of the Town\" columns and submitting poetry and short stories to the magazine. In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like The Carpentered Hen (1958) and The Same Door (1959). These works were influenced by Updike's early engagement with The New Yorker. This early work also featured the influence of J. D. Salinger (\"A&P\"); John Cheever (\"Snowing in Greenwich Village\"); and the Modernists Marcel Proust, Henry Green, James Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nDuring this time, Updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis.  Suffering from a loss of religious faith, he began reading Søren Kierkegaard and the theologian Karl Barth. Both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs, which in turn figured prominently in his fiction. Updike remained a believing Christian for the rest of his life..\n\n1960s–1970s\n\nLater, Updike and his family relocated to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Many commentators, including a columnist in the local Ipswich Chronicle, asserted that the fictional town of Tarbox in Couples was based on Ipswich. Updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper.The Ipswich Chronicle. 25 April 1968. Letter: \"Updike 'flatly denies' that Tarbox is Ipswich.\" Impressions of Updike's day-to-day life in Ipswich during the 1960s and 1970s are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after Updike's death and written by a friend and contemporary. In Ipswich, Updike wrote Rabbit, Run (1960), on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and The Centaur (1963), two of his most acclaimed and famous works; the latter won the National Book Award.\n\nRabbit, Run featured Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become Updike's most enduring and critically acclaimed character. Updike wrote three additional novels about him. Rabbit, Run was featured in Times All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/ All-Time 100 Novels]\n\nShort stories\n\nUpdike's career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with The New Yorker, which published him frequently throughout his career, despite the fact that he had departed the magazine's employment after only two years. Updike's memoir indicates that he stayed in his \"corner of New England to give its domestic news\" with a focus on the American home from the point of view of a male writer.Gross, Terry (2004).  Being square.  All I did was ask:  Conversations with writers, actors, musicians, and artists (p. 24).  New York, NY:  Hyperion. Updike's contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts, but William Shawn, The New Yorker's editor from 1952 to 1987, rejected several as too explicit.\n\nThe Maple short stories, collected in Too Far To Go (1979), reflected the ebb and flow of Updike's first marriage; \"Separating\" (1974) and \"Here Come the Maples\" (1976) related to his divorce. These stories also reflect the role of alcohol in 1970s America.Donahue, Peter. \"Pouring Drinks and Getting Drunk: The Social and Personal Implications of Drinking in John Updike's Too Far to Go.\" Studies in Short Fiction 33.3 (1996): (p. 362). Ebscohost. Web. 22 Mar. 2017 They were the basis for the television movie also called Too Far To Go, broadcast by NBC in 1979.\n\nUpdike's short stories were collected in several volumes published by Alfred A. Knopf over five decades. In 2013, the Library of America issued a two-volume boxed edition of 186 stories under the title The Collected Stories.https://www.loa.org/books/391-the-collected-stories-boxed-set Retrieved 14 March 2017\n\nNovels\n\nIn 1971, Updike published a sequel to Rabbit, Run called Rabbit Redux, his response to the 1960s; Rabbit reflected much of Updike's confusion and ambivalence towards the social and political changes that beset the United States during that time.[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6584 Charlie Rose]  interview, 24 October 1995\n\nUpdike's early Olinger period was set in the Pennsylvania of his youth; it ended around 1965 with the lyrical Of the Farm.\n\nAfter his early novels, Updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity, adultery, and marital unrest, especially in suburban America; and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores.\n[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2009/01/updike-john-mortimer-rabbit \"Farewell, King John of Suburbia\"], New Statesman, 29 January 2009 He once wrote that it was \"a subject which, if I have not exhausted, has exhausted me\". The most prominent of Updike's novels of this vein is Couples (1968), a novel about adultery in a small fictional Massachusetts town called Tarbox. It garnered Updike an appearance on the cover of Time magazine with the headline \"The Adulterous Society\". Both the magazine article and, to an extent, the novel struck a chord of national concern over whether American society was abandoning all social standards of conduct in sexual matters.\n\nThe Coup (1978), a lauded[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1978/dec/21/updike-le-noir/ Updike le Noir | by John Thompson | The New York Review of Books] novel about an African dictatorship inspired by a visit he made to Africa, found Updike working in new territory.\n\n1980s–2000s\n\nIn 1980, he published another novel featuring Harry Angstrom, Rabbit Is Rich, which won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—all three major American literary prizes. The novel found \"Rabbit the fat and happy owner of a Toyota dealership.\" Updike found it difficult to end the book, because he was \"having so much fun\" in the imaginary county Rabbit and his family inhabited.\n\nAfter writing Rabbit Is Rich, Updike published The Witches of Eastwick (1984), a playful novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He described it as an attempt to \"make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors\".Michiko Kakutani, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/books/20kaku.html?_r1&ref\nbooks&oref=slogin Books of the Times: 'The Widows of Eastwick]'\", New York Times, 19 October 2008 One of Updike's most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom's list of canonical 20th-century literature (in The Western Canon).Harold Bloom, The Western Canon: The Books and Schools of the Ages (1994), \"The Chaotic Age: The United States,\" Riverhead Trade. In 2008 Updike published The Widows of Eastwick, a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.\n\nIn 1986, he published the unconventional novel Roger's Version, the second volume of the so-called Scarlet Letter trilogy, about an attempt to prove God's existence using a computer program. Author and critic Martin Amis called it a \"near-masterpiece\".Martin Amis, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/john-updike-interview-amis-martin When Amis met Updike ...]\", The Guardian, 1 February 2009 The novel S. (1989), uncharacteristically featuring a female protagonist, concluded Updike's reworking of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter.\n\nUpdike enjoyed working in series; in addition to the Rabbit novels and the Maples stories, a recurrent Updike alter ego is the moderately well-known, unprolific Jewish novelist and eventual Nobel laureate Henry Bech, chronicled in three comic short-story cycles: Bech, a Book (1970), Bech Is Back (1981) and Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel (1998). These stories were compiled as The Complete Henry Bech (2001) by Everyman's Library. Bech is a comical and self-conscious antithesis of Updike's own literary persona: Jewish, a World War II veteran, reclusive, and unprolific to a fault.Jack De Bellis (ed.), The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), \"Bech, Henry\", pp. 52–53.\n\nIn 1990, he published the last Rabbit novel, Rabbit at Rest, in which his main character died. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike's most celebrated. In 2000, Updike included the novella Rabbit Remembered in his collection Licks of Love, drawing the Rabbit saga to a close. His Pulitzers for the last two Rabbit novels make Updike one of only three writers to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, the others being William Faulkner and Booth Tarkington.\n\nIn 1995, Everyman's Library collected and canonized the four novels as the omnibus Rabbit Angstrom; Updike wrote an introduction in which he described Rabbit as \"a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight.\"John Updike, \"Introduction\", Rabbit Angstrom (1995), Everyman's Library. Updike later called Rabbit \"a brother to me, and a good friend. He opened me up as a writer.\", 1996\n\nAfter the publication of Rabbit at Rest, Updike spent the rest of the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of Memories of the Ford Administration (1992), the magical realism of Brazil (1994), the science fiction of Toward the End of Time (1997), the postmodernism of Gertrude and Claudius (2000), and the experimental fiction of Seek My Face (2002).\n\nIn the midst of these, he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel, In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996), a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in America. It is considered the most successful novel of Updike's late career. Some critics have predicted that posterity may consider the novel a \"late masterpiece overlooked or praised by rote in its day, only to be rediscovered by another generation\",Adam Gopnik, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/02/09/090209ta_talk_gopnik Postscript: John Updike]\", The New Yorker, 9 February 2009 while others thought it overlong and depressing. In Villages (2004), Updike returned to the familiar territory of infidelities in New England. His 22nd novel, Terrorist (2006), the story of a fervent young extremist Muslim in New Jersey, garnered media attention but little critical praise.\n\nIn 2003, Updike published The Early Stories, a large collection of his short fiction spanning the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. More than 800 pages long, with over one hundred stories, it has been called \"a richly episodic and lyrical Bildungsroman ... in which Updike traces the trajectory from adolescence, college, married life, fatherhood, separation and divorce\". It won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2004.[http://www.powells.com/prizes/penfaulkner_fiction.html Award Winners—The PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction] . Powell's Books, Powells.com This lengthy volume nevertheless excluded several stories found in his short-story collections of the same period.\n\nUpdike worked in a wide array of genres, including fiction, poetry (most of it compiled in Collected Poems: 1953–1993, 1993), essays (collected in nine separate volumes), a play (Buchanan Dying, 1974), and a memoir (Self-Consciousness, 1989).\n\nUpdike's array of awards includes two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, two National Book Awards, three National Book Critics Circle awards, the 1989 National Medal of Arts, the 2003 National Humanities Medal, and the Rea Award for the Short Story for outstanding achievement. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Updike to present the 2008 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government's highest humanities honor; Updike's lecture was titled \"The Clarity of Things: What Is American about American Art\".\n\nAt the end of his life, Updike was working on a novel about St. Paul and early Christianity.[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/06/updikes-roots-and-evolution/ Updike’s roots and evolution | Harvard Gazette] Upon his death, The New Yorker published an appreciation by Adam Gopnik of Updike's lifetime association with the magazine, calling him \"one of the greatest of all modern writers, the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing\".\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nUpdike married Mary E. Pennington, an art student at Radcliffe College, in 1953, while he was still a student at Harvard. She accompanied him to Oxford, England, where he attended art school and where their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1955. The couple had three more children together: writer David (born 1957), artist Michael (born 1959) and Miranda (born 1960). They divorced in 1974. Updike had seven grandsons, Anoff, Kwame, Wesley, Trevor, Kai, Sawyer and Seneca.\n\nIn 1977 Updike married Martha Ruggles Bernhard, with whom he lived for more than thirty years in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. He died of lung cancer at a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, on January 27, 2009, at the age of 76.Ancestry.com. Social Security Death Index [database on-line].

Social Security Administration.\n\nPoetry\n\nUpdike published eight volumes of poetry over his career, including his first book The Carpentered Hen (1958), and one of his last, the posthumous Endpoint (2009). The New Yorker published excerpts of Endpoint in its 16 March 2009 issue.  Much of Updike's poetical output was recollected in Knopf's Collected Poems (1993). He wrote that \"I began as a writer of light verse, and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form.\"[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id\n81868 John Updike: The Poetry Foundation, archive] The poet Thomas M. Disch noted that because Updike was such a well-known novelist, his poetry \"could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible\"; Disch saw Updike's light verse instead as a poetry of \"epigrammatical lucidity\".[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/660 Poets.org: John Updike] His poetry has been praised for its engagement with \"a variety of forms and topics\", its \"wit and precision\", and for its depiction of topics familiar to American readers.\n\nBritish poet Gavin Ewart praised Updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability \"to make the ordinary seem strange\", and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry.Gavin Ewart, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/06/lifetimes/updike-facingnature.html Making it strange]\", New York Times, 28 April 1985 Reading Endpoint aloud, the critic Charles McGrath claimed that he found \"another, deeper music\" in Updike's poetry, finding that Updike's wordplay \"smooths and elides itself\" and has many subtle \"sound effects\".Charles McGrath, \"[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/reading-updikes-last-words-aloud/?ref=books Reading Updike's Last Words, Aloud]\", New York Times, 3 April 2009 John Keenan, who praised the collection Endpoint as \"beautiful and poignant\", noted that his poetry's engagement with \"the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him\".John Keenan, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/mar/12/updike-poetry-endpoint The clarity of Updike's poetry should not obscure its class]\", The Guardian, 12 March 2009\n\nLiterary criticism and art criticism\n\nUpdike was also a critic of literature and art, one frequently cited as one of the best American critics of his generation.James Atlas, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n02/atla01_.html Towards the Transhuman]\", London Review of Books, 2 February 1984 In the introduction to Picked-Up Pieces, his 1975 collection of prose, he listed his personal rules for literary criticism:\n\n1. Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt.\n\n2. Give enough direct quotation—at least one extended passage—of the book's prose so the review's reader can form his own impression, can get his own taste.\n\n3. Confirm your description of the book with quotation from the book, if only phrase-long, rather than proceeding by fuzzy précis.\n\n4. Go easy on plot summary, and do not give away the ending.\n\n5. If the book is judged deficient, cite a successful example along the same lines, from the author's œuvre or elsewhere. Try to understand the failure. Sure it's his and not yours?\n\nTo these concrete five might be added a vaguer sixth, having to do with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never ... try to put the author \"in his place,\" making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.\"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/ Remembering Updike: The Gospel According to John]\", New Yorker online\n\nHe reviewed \"nearly every major writer of the 20th century and some 19th-century authors\", typically in The New Yorker, always trying to make his reviews \"animated.\" He also championed young writers, comparing them to his own literary heroes including Vladimir Nabokov and Marcel Proust.ZZ Packer, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/index.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online Good reviews from Updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales; some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as Erica Jong, Thomas Mallon and Jonathan Safran Foer.Charles McGrath, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/weekinreview/01mcgrath.html John Updike's Mighty Pen]\", New York Times, 31 January 2009\n\nBad reviews by Updike sometimes caused controversy,Alex Carnevale, \"[http://gawker.com/5069587/toni-morrison-is-john-updikes-latest-lit+fit-victim Literary Feuds: Toni Morrison is John Updike's Latest Lit-Fit Victim]\", October 2008, Gawker.com as when in late 2008 he gave a \"damning\" review of Toni Morrison's novel A Mercy.\"[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1565,updike-takes-a-swipe-at-toni-morrison,52615 Updike takes a swipe at Toni Morrison]\", The First Post, 29 October 2008John Updike, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/11/03/081103crbo_books_updike Dreamy Wilderness]\", New Yorker, 3 November 2008\n\nUpdike was praised for his literary criticism's conventional simplicity and profundity, for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms, and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism.Wyatt Mason, \"[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/12/0081837 Among the reviewers: John Updike and the book-review bugaboo]\", Harper's, December 2007\n\nMuch of Updike's art criticism appeared in The New York Review of Books, where he often wrote about American art.[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/158 \"John Updike\"].

The American artist, first born into a continent without museums and art schools, took Nature as his only instructor, and things as his principal study. A bias toward the empirical, toward the evidential object in the numinous fullness of its being, leads to a certain lininess, as the artist intently maps the visible in a New World that feels surrounded by chaos and emptiness.\n\nCritical reputation and style\n\nUpdike is considered one of the greatest American fiction writers of his generation.\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/books/fiction-25-years.html What Is the Best Work of American Fiction of the Last 25 Years?]\" New York Times, 21 May 2006, \"a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages\" listed the Rabbit series as one of the few greatest works of modern American fiction.

Some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault, questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes, while others criticized Updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships.\n\nOther critics argue that Updike's \"dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader\". On the whole, however, Updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres, wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style, with \"shrewd insight into the sorrows, frustrations, and banality of American life\".\n\nUpdike's character Rabbit Angstrom, the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his magnum opus, has been said to have \"entered the pantheon of signal American literary figures\", along with Huckleberry Finn, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield and others.Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/books/28updike.html?pagewanted\n2&ref=books John Updike, a Lyrical Writer of the Middle Class, Dies at 76]\", New York Times, 28 January 2009 A 2002 list by Book magazine of the 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 listed Rabbit in the top five.Book magazine, March/April 2002, \"[http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html 100 Best Fictional Characters since 1900]\", via NPR The Rabbit novels, the Henry Bech stories, and the Maples stories have been canonized by Everyman's Library.[http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/classics/authors.html \"Everyman's Library: Authors\"], Random House\n\nAfter Updike's death, Harvard's Houghton Library acquired his papers, manuscripts, and letters, naming the collection the John Updike Archive.Tracy Jan, \"[http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2009/10/07/harvard_buys_updike_archive/ Harvard buys Updike archive]\", Boston Globe, 7 October 2009 2009 also saw the founding of the John Updike Society,[http://blogs.iwu.edu/johnupdikesociety/ \"The John Updike Society Homepage\"].

Retrieved 9 December 2009.\n\nEulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist Ian McEwan wrote that Updike's \"literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the Shakespearean\", and that Updike's death marked \"the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century's second half.\"\n\nMcEwan said the Rabbit series is Updike's \"masterpiece and will surely be his monument\", and concluded:\nUpdike is a master of effortless motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.\n\nThis is at the heart of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an exercise in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, \"and not chop them down to what you think is the right size.\"Ian McEwan, \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22391 On John Updike]\", New York Review of Books Vol 56 No 4, 12 March 2009\n\nJonathan Raban, highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to Updike's prose, called Rabbit at Rest \"one of the very few modern novels in English ... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, and not feel the draft ... It is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details, of shades and nuances, of the byplay between one sentence and the next, and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness.\"Jonathan Raban, The Oxford Book of the Sea (1993), Oxford University Press, pp. 509–517.\n\nThe novelist Philip Roth, considered one of Updike's chief literary rivals,\"[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/updike/appreciation.html John Updike: 2008 Jefferson Lecture] \", National Endowment for the Humanities wrote, \"John Updike is our time's greatest man of letters, as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer. He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"\n\nThe noted critic James Wood called Updike \"a prose writer of great beauty, but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough, and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey\".James Wood, The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief (2000), \"John Updike's Complacent God\", Modern Library, pp. 192. In a review of Licks of Love (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's \"prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons\" but that there often exists in his work a \"hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview\". Wood both praised and criticized Updike's language for having \"an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract\". According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing \"the perfect sentence\" and his style is characterized by a \"delicate deferral\" of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of that language floats above reality, Wood wrote: For some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books—here extended a further instance—suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us—'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed—and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.James Wood, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n08/wood02_.html Gossip in Gilt]\", London Review of Books, 19 April 2001\n\nIn direct contrast to Wood's evaluation, the Oxford critic Thomas Karshan asserted that Updike is \"intensely intellectual\", with a style that constitutes his \"manner of thought\" not merely \"a set of dainty curlicues\". Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the \"traditional role of the epic writer\". According to Karshan, \"Updike's writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child.\"\n\nDisagreeing with Wood's critique of Updike's alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike's language as convincingly naturalistic:\nUpdike's sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith. Rather, like Proust's sentences in Updike's description, they \"seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith.\" Updike aspires to \"this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that Cézanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs.\" Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world. But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them.\n\nHarold Bloom once called Updike \"a minor novelist with a major style. A quite beautiful and very considerable stylist ... He specializes in the easier pleasures.\"Richard Eder, \"The Paris Interviews\", New York Times, 25 December 2007. Bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on Updike in 1987, in which he concluded that Updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are \"beyond praise\"; nevertheless, Bloom went on, \"the American sublime will never touch his pages\".Harold Bloom, ed., Modern Critical Views of John Updike, \"Introduction,\" Chelsea House, New York, 1987.\n\nOn The Dick Cavett Show in 1981, the novelist and short-story writer John Cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review Rabbit Is Rich. He replied:\nThe reason I didn't review the book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My appreciation of it is that diverse and that complicated ... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.Dick Cavett, \"[http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/writers-bloc-when-updike-and-cheever-came-to-visit/?apage=5 Writers Bloc: When Updike and Cheever Came to Visit]\", New York Times, 13 February 2009. Video 14 October 1981\n\nThe Fiction Circus, an online and multimedia literary magazine, called Updike one of the \"four Great American Novelists\" of his time along with Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo, each jokingly represented as a sign of the Zodiac. Furthermore, Updike was seen as the \"best prose writer in the world\", like Nabokov before him. But in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries, the Circus asserted that nobody \"thought of Updike as a vital writer.\"S. Future, \"[http://fictioncircus.com/news.php?id280&mode\none Updike]\", The Fiction Circus, 27 January 2009,\n\nAdam Gopnik of The New Yorker evaluated Updike as \"the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing ... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction—the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite to get it all in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly—were both alive in him.\"\n\nThe critic James Wolcott, in a review of Updike's last novel, The Widows of Eastwick (2008), noted that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an affirmation of America's ultimate merits: \"Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden dab of sperm.\"James Wolcott, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/wolc01_.html Caretaker/Pallbearer]\", London Review of Books, 1 January 2009\n\nGore Vidal, in a controversial essay in the Times Literary Supplement, professed to have \"never taken Updike seriously as a writer\". He criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its \"blandness and acceptance of authority in any form\". He concludes that Updike \"describes to no purpose\". In reference to Updike's wide establishment acclaim, Vidal mockingly called him \"our good child\" and excoriated his alleged political conservatism. Vidal ultimately concluded, \"Updike's work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where Authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up.\"Gore Vidal, \"[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5610640.ece Rabbit's own burrow]\", Times Literary Supplement, 26 April 1996\n\nRobert B. Silvers, editor of The New York Review of Books, called Updike \"one of the most elegant and coolly observant writers of his generation\".Brand, Madeleine. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99921377 Robert B. Silvers interview for NPR Remembrances: \"John Updike: The Shy Man And Great Writer\"]. NPR, Day to Day, 27 January 2009\n\nThe short-story writer Lorrie Moore, who once described Updike as \"American literature's greatest short story writer ... and arguably our greatest writer\",Mary Rourke, \"[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-updike28-2009jan28,0,3942596.story John Updike dies at 76; Pulitzer-winning author]\", Los Angeles Times, 28 January 2009 reviewed Updike's body of short stories in The New York Review, praising their intricate detail and rich imagery: \"his eye and his prose never falter, even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his story's way\".Lorrie Moore, \"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16794 Home Truths]\", New York Review of Books, 20 November 2003\n\nIn a post commemorating his birthday in 2011, blogger and literary critic Christy Potter called Updike \"... THE Writer, the kind of writer everyone has heard of, the one whose name you can bring up at a party and people who have never read one thing he wrote will still nod their heads knowingly and say, 'Oh yes, John Updike. The writer.'\"Potter, Christy. Unraveling the Mysterious Appeal of John Updike. http://www.ChristytheWriter.com/?p=2611, 2011\n\nDuring November 2008 the editors of the UK's Literary Review magazine awarded Updike their Bad Sex in Fiction Lifetime Achievement Award, which celebrates \"crude, tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature\".\n\nThemes\n\nThe principal themes in Updike's work are religion, sex, and AmericaThe Economist, \"[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id13014056 An American subversive]\", 29 January 2009 as well as death.Jack De Bellis (ed.), \"Mortality and Immortality\", The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), pp. 286. See here for many subsequent quotes and citations on death. Often he would combine them, frequently in his favored terrain of \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", of which he once said, \"I like middles. It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.\"\n\nFor example, the decline of religion in America is chronicled in In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996) alongside the history of cinema, and Rabbit Angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend Reverend Jack Eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in Rabbit, Run (1960).\n\nCritics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.\n\nDescribing his purpose in writing prose, Updike himself, in the introduction to his Early Stories: 1953–1975 (2004), wrote that his aim was always \"to give the mundane its beautiful due.\" Elsewhere he famously said, \"When I write, I aim my mind not towards New York but towards a vague spot east of Kansas.\"Robert McCrun, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/john-updike-literary-generation John Updike was of a generation that changed the literary landscape irrevocably],\" The Guardian, 1 February 2009 Some have suggested that the \"best statement of Updike's aesthetic comes in his early memoir 'The Dogwood Tree'\" (1962): \"Blankness is not emptiness; we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else. And in fact there is a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.\"John Updike, \"The Dogwood Tree\", Assorted Prose (1965), Knopf.\n\nSex\n\nSex in Updike's work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it:\n\nThe critic Edward Champion notes that Updike's prose heavily favors \"external sexual imagery\" rife with \"explicit anatomical detail\" rather than descriptions of \"internal emotion\" in descriptions of sex.The Bat Segundo Show, [http://www.edrants.com/segundo/the-bat-segundo-show-50/ Show #50, John Updike] In Champion's interview with Updike on The Bat Segundo Show, Updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex \"real\" in his prose. Another sexual theme commonly addressed in Updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in Couples (1968). The Updikean narrator is often \"a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family.\"Antonya Nelson, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/2.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online\n\nUnited States\n\nSimilarly, Updike wrote about America with a certain nostalgia, reverence, and recognition and celebration of America's broad diversity. ZZ Packer wrote that in Updike, \"there seemed a strange ability to harken both America the Beautiful as well as America the Plain Jane, and the lovely Protestant backbone in his fiction and essays, when he decided to show it off, was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic.\"ZZ Packer, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online\n\nThe Rabbit novels in particular can be viewed, according to Julian Barnes, as \"a distraction from, and a glittering confirmation of, the vast bustling ordinariness of American life.\"Julian Barnes, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/remembering-upd/2.html Remembering Updike]\", New Yorker online But as Updike celebrated ordinary America, he also alluded to its decline: at times, he was \"so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of America.\"Jack De Bellis (ed.), \"More Matter\", The John Updike Encyclopedia (2000), pp. 281. Adam Gopnik concludes that \"Updike's great subject was the American attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture. He documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and Toyotas and family love and family obligation. For Updike, this effort was blessed, and very nearly successful.\"\n\nUpdike's novels about America almost always contain references to political events of the time. In this sense, they are artifacts of their historical eras, showing how national leaders shape and define their times. The lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background.\n\nDeath\n\nUpdike often wrote about death, his characters providing a \"mosaic of reactions\" to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In The Poorhouse Fair (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, \"There is no goodness without belief... And if you have not believed, at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next\", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.\n\nFor Rabbit Angstrom, with his constant musings on mortality, his near-witnessing of his daughter's death, and his often shaky faith, death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications. At the end of Rabbit at Rest (1990), though, Rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty, telling his son Nelson on his deathbed, \"...But enough. Maybe. Enough.\" In The Centaur (1963), George Caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer. Death can also be a sort of unseen terror; it \"occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence.\"\n\nUpdike himself also experienced a \"crisis over the afterlife\", and indeed \"many of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man: Henry Bech's concern that he was 'a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust,' or Colonel Ellelloû's lament that 'we will be forgotten, all of us forgotten.' Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God—looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with 'its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.'\". Updike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings, including the poem \"Perfection Wasted\" (1990):\nAnd another regrettable thing about death\nis the ceasing of your own brand of magic....\n\nIn popular culture \n\n* Updike was featured on the cover of Time twice, on 26 April 1968 and again on 18 October 1982.[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/photocredit/achievers/upd0-006 26 April 1968 Time cover] , [http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/photocredit/achievers/upd0-007 18 October 1982 Time cover] \n* Updike was the subject of a \"closed book examination\" by Nicholson Baker, titled U and I (1991).
