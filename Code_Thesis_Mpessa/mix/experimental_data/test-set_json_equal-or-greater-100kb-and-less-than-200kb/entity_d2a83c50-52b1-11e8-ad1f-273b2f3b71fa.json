It is said to occupy continuous territory that are otherwise conventionally Eastern Europe and Western Europe.[http://www.historyguide.org/europe/lecture14.html Lecture 14: The Origins of the Cold War]. Historyguide.org. Retrieved on 29 October 2011. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \"strategic awakening\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope and the Visegrád Four. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121150504/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2010_EN_Table1.pdf 2010 Human Development Index]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 29 October 2011.\n\nHistorical perspective \n\nMiddle Ages and early modern era \n\nElements of unity for Western and Central Europe were Roman Catholicism and Latin. However Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), Eastern Europe developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Church Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nFile:Carolingian empire 843 888.jpg|Frankish Empire and its tributaries (AD 843-888)\nFile:Great Moravia Svatopluk.jpg|alt=Moravia under Svatopluk|Certain and disputed borders of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I (AD 870–894)\nFile:Church in poland 12-13c.svg|Kingdom of Poland in late 12th-13th centuries.\nFile:Karte Böhmen unter Ottokar II.png|Bohemia in 1273\nFile:Europe mediterranean 1190 cropped.jpg|Kingdom of Hungary in 1190\nFile:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|Holy Roman Empire in 1600 superimposed on modern state borders\n\nAccording to Hungarian historian Jenő Szűcs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.\n\nIn 1335 under the rule of the King Charles I of Hungary, the castle of Visegrád, the seat of the Hungarian monarchs was the scene of the royal summit of the Kings of Poland, Bohemia and Hungary. They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful Central European initiative.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted Magdeburg rights.\n\nBefore World War I \n\nBefore 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in Eastern Europe, industrialization lagged far behind. Russia, for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.Jackson J. Spielvogel: Western Civilization: Alternate Volume: Since 1300. p. 618.\nThe concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century, but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called Mitteleuropa. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from Rhine to Vistula, or even Dnieper, and from the Baltic Sea to the Balkans.A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004 An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, Central Europe, New York 1903\n\nOn 21 January 1904, Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein (Central European Economic Association) was established in Berlin with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The \"bible\" of the concept was Friedrich Naumann’s book MitteleuropaF. Naumann, Mitteleuropa, Berlin: Reimer, 1915 in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its centre Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other. The concept failed after the German defeat in World War I and the dissolution of Austria–Hungary. The revival of the idea may be observed during the Hitler era.\n\nInterwar period \n\nAccording to Emmanuel de Martonne, in 1927 the Central European countries included: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Switzerland. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; Géographie universelle (1927), edited by Paul Vidal de la Blache and Lucien Gallois\n\nThe interwar period (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of \"new\" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither Little Entente nor Intermarium (Międzymorze) ideas succeeded.\n\nThe interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, Austria), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance. After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in Brussels in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.\n\nHungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study Versailles System and Central Europe (2006): \"Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the Little Entente, military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down\".\n\nThe avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The Sourcebook of Central European avantgards (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, and Poland from 1910 to 1930. The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.\n\nMitteleuropa \n\nThe German term Mitteleuropa (or alternatively its literal translation into English, Middle EuropeJohnson, p. 165) is an ambiguous German concept. It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic cultural hegemony until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the Baltic countries north of East Prussia). According to Fritz Fischer Mitteleuropa was a scheme in the era of the Reich of 1871–1918 by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.Hayes, p. 16 Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic \"Drang nach Westen\" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a Mitteleuropa ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.Hayes, p. 17\n\nIn Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union, and ethnically cleansed of Germans by communist authorities and forces (see expulsion of Germans after World War II) due to Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference decisions. In this view Bohemia and Moravia, with its dual Western Slavic and Germanic heritage, combined with the historic element of the \"Sudetenland\", is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.\n\nThe term \"Mitteleuropa\" conjures up negative historical associations among some elder people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.Johnson, p. 6 Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.Johnson, p. 7 German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century Vienna, Budapest and Prague became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of \"Mitteleuropa\" destroyed this kind of culture instead.Johnson, p. 170 However, the term \"Mitteleuropa\" is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism. In fact, many people from the new states of Germany do not identify themselves as being part of Western Europe and therefore prefer the term \"Mitteleuropa\".\n\nCentral Europe behind the Iron Curtain \n\nFollowing World War II, large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the Eastern bloc. Czech author Milan Kundera (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the \"Tragedy of Central Europe\" in the New York Review of Books. Consequently, the English term Central Europe was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe. This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.\n\nThe post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the Eastern Bloc countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the Stalinist doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book The limits and divisions of European history, London and New York 1950 At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004\n\nAccording to Karl A. Sinnhuber (Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term) most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides Austria, only marginal Central European states of Finland and Yugoslavia did preserve their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out from any military alliances in Europe.\n\nAccording to Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon,Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980 Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Switzerland, and northern marginal regions of Italy and Yugoslavia (northern states – Croatia, Vojvodina and Slovenia), as well as northeastern France.\n\nCurrent views \n\nRather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.\n\nMain propositions, gathered by Jerzy Kłoczowski, include:Jerzy Kłoczowski, Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 \n* West-Central and East-Central Europe – this conception, presented in 1950,Oskar Halecki, The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed & Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the Reich, and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations from Finland to Greece, placed between great empires of Scandinavia, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union.\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth – Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with Polish historians, insist on the importance of the concept.\n* Central Europe as a region connected to the Western civilisation for a very long time, including countries such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kingdom of Croatia, Holy Roman Empire, later German Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Crown of Bohemia. Central Europe understood in this way borders on Russia and South-Eastern Europe, but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later Austria-Hungary) – a concept which is popular in regions along the Danube River.\n\n* A concept underlining the links connecting Belarus and Ukraine with Russia and treating the Russian Empire together with the whole Slavic Orthodox population as one entity – this position is taken by the Russian historiography.\n* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the South-Eastern states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the \"East Centre\" expressing their links with the Western culture.\n\nAccording to Ronald Tiersky, the 1991 summit held in Visegrád, Hungary and attended by the Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the Visegrád Group became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.Tiersky, p. 472\n\nPeter J. Katzenstein described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the Visegrád Group countries in different, though comparable ways.Katzenstein, p. 6 According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse \"Central European identity\" refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.Katzenstein, p. 4\n\nLonnie R. Johnson points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from Western, Eastern and Southeast Europe:Lonnie R. Johnson \"Central Europe: enemies, neighbors, friends\", Oxford University Press, 1996 \n* One criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the Roman Catholic West and the Orthodox East.Johnson, p.4 The pagans of Central Europe were converted to Roman Catholicism while in Southeastern and Eastern Europe they were brought into the fold of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.Johnson, p. 4 Hungary and Poland, small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories. The historical Kingdom of Hungary was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today, while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the 16th century. Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples.\n\nHe also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamic historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, Lithuania, a fair share of Belarus and western Ukraine are in Eastern Europe today, but  years ago they were in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Johnson's study on Central Europe received acclaim and positive reviews in the scientific community. However, according to Romanian researcher Maria Bucur this very ambitious project suffers from the weaknesses imposed by its scope (almost 1600 years of history).\n\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia defines Central Europe as: Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. The World Factbook uses the same definition adding Slovenia too. Encarta Encyclopedia and Encyclopædia Britannica do not clearly define the region, but Encarta places the same countries into Central Europe in its individual articles on countries, adding Slovenia in \"south central Europe\".\n\nThe German Encyclopaedia Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon (Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the Schelde to Vistula and from the Danube to the Moravian Gate. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland; in the broader sense Romania too, occasionally also Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nStates \n\nThe comprehension of the concept of Central Europe is an ongoing source of controversy, though the Visegrád Group constituents are almost always included as de facto C.E. countries. Although views on which countries belong to Central Europe are vastly varied, according to many sources (see section Current views on Central Europe) the region includes the states listed in the sections below.\n\n*\n*Lonnie Johnson, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Central_Europe.html?id\ne_m13Hk3AFEC&redir_esc=y Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends], Oxford University Press (alternatively placed in Southeastern Europe)Andrew Geddes, Charles Lees, Andrew Taylor : \"The European Union and South East Europe: The Dynamics of Europeanization and multilevel governance\", 2013, RoutledgeKlaus Liebscher, Josef Christl, Peter Mooslechner, Doris Ritzberger-Grünwald : \"European Economic Integration and South-East Europe: Challenges and Prospects\", 2005, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* (sometimes placed in Southeastern Europe)\n*\n\nDepending on context, Central European countries are sometimes grouped as Eastern or Western European countries, collectively or individually but some place them in Eastern Europe instead: for instance Austria can be referred to as Central European, as well as Eastern European or Western European.\n\nOther countries and regions \n\nSome sources also add neighbouring countries for historical reasons (the former Austro-Hungarian and German Empires, and modern Baltic states), or based on geographical and/or cultural reasons:\n\n* (TransylvaniaSven Tägil, [https://books.google.com/books?idll-6JYQyPsIC&pg\nPA191&dqTransylvania+%22Central+Europe%22&hl\nen&saX&ei\nLy7HT_mtM4mZhQeQiM2NCw&sqi2&ved\n0CDcQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nTransylvania%20%22Central%20Europe%22&ffalse Regions in Central Europe: The Legacy of History], C.

Benelux countries are generally considered a part of Western Europe, rather than Central Europe. Nevertheless, they are occasionally mentioned in the Central European context due to cultural, historical and linguistic ties.\n\nThe following states or some of their regions may sometimes be included in Central Europe:\n* (South Tyrol, Trentino, Trieste and Gorizia, Friuli, occasionally Veneto or all of Northern Italy)\n* (Transcarpathia, Galicia and Northern Bukovina)\n\nGeography \n\nGeography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the North across the Baltic Sea namely the Northern Europe (or Scandinavia), and to the South across the Alps, the Apennine peninsula (or Italy), and the Balkan peninsula across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to Western Europe and Eastern Europe are geographically less defined and for this reason the cultural and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The Rhine river which runs South-North through Western Germany is an exception.\n\nSouthwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube- and their respective floodplains.[http://www.icpdr.org/main/sites/default/files/BA%20Facts%20Figures.pdf Danube Facts and Figures. Bosnia and Herzegovina (April 2007)] (PDF file) The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) and Ukraine (\"peri- Pannonian states\").\n\nAs southeastern division of the Eastern Alps, the Dinaric Alps extend for 650 kilometres along the coast of the Adriatic Sea (northwest-southeast), from the Julian Alps in the northwest down to the Šar-Korab massif, north-south. According to the Freie Universitaet Berlin, this mountain chain is classified as South Central European.\n\nThe Central European flora region stretches from Central France (the Massif Central) to Central Romania (Carpathians) and Southern Scandinavia.Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch; Lehrbuch der Geobotanik. Pflanze und Vegetation in Raum und Zeit. Elsevier, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, München 2004 \n\nAt times, the term \"Central Europe\" denotes a geographic definition as the Danube region in the heart of the continent, including the language and culture areas which are today included in the states of Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and usually also Austria and Germany, but never Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union towards the Ural mountains.\n\nStatistics \n\nData \n\n*Area: 1.036.370 km2 (2012) \n*Population: (calculated data) 163.518.571 (July 2012) \n*Population density: (calculated data) 157.78/km2 (2012) \n*GDP (PPP) per capita: US$34.444 (2012) \n*Life expectancy: (calculated data) 78.32-year (2012) \n*Unemployment rate: 8.2% (2012) \n*Fertility rate: 1.41 births/woman (2012) \n*Human Development Index: 0.874 (2012) (very high) \n*Globalization Index (regional): 80.09 (2013) There is no data in the Liechtenstein of economic globalization\n\nDemography \n\nCentral Europe is one of continent's most populous regions. It includes countries of varied sizes, ranging from tiny Liechtenstein to Germany, the largest European country by population (that is entirely placed in Europe). Demographic figures for countries entirely located within notion of Central Europe (\"the core countries\") number around 165 million people, out of which around 82 million are residents of Germany. Other populations include: Poland with around 38.5 million residents, Czech Republic at 10.5 million, Hungary at 10 million, Austria with 8.5 million, Switzerland with its 8 million inhabitants, Slovakia at 5.4 million, Croatia with its 4.3 million residents, Slovenia at 2 million (2014 estimate) and Liechtenstein at a bit less than 40,000.\n\nIf the countries which are occasionally included in Central Europe were counted in, partially or in whole – Romania (20 million), Serbia (6.9 million), Lithuania (2.9 million), Latvia (2 million), Estonia (1.3 million) – it would contribute to the rise of between 25–35 million, depending on whether regional or integral approach was used. If smaller, western and eastern historical parts of Central Europe would be included in the demographic corpus, further 20 million people of different nationalities would also be added in the overall count, it would surpass the 200 million people figure.\n\nEconomy \n\nCurrencies \n\nCurrently, the members of the Eurozone include Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland use their currencies (Croatian kuna, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish złoty), but are obliged to adopt the Euro. Switzerland uses its own currency, Swiss franc.\n\nHuman Development Index \n\nCountries in descending order of Human Development Index (2014 data):\n*: 0.917  (ranked 3)\n*: 0.911  (ranked 6)\n*: 0.889  (ranked 18)\n*: 0.881  (ranked 21)\n*: 0.874  (ranked 25)\n*: 0.861  (ranked 28)\n*: 0.834  (ranked 35)\n*: 0.830  (ranked 37)\n*: 0.818  (ranked 43)\n*: 0.812  (ranked 47)\n\nGlobalisation \n\nThe index of globalization in Central European countries (2015 data):\n\n*: 89.83 (ranked 4)\n*: 87.01 (ranked 5)\n*: 85.78 (ranked 9)\n*: 83.62 (ranked 16)\n*: 83.60 (ranked 17)\n*: 83.55 (ranked 18)\n*: 79.90 (ranked 23)\n*: 78.24 (ranked 27)\n*: 76.24 (ranked 32)\n*: 75.59 (ranked 35)\n*: not listed (ranked 180 in 2015 with 29.23)\n\nProsperity Index \n\nLegatum Prosperity Index demonstrates an average and high level of prosperity in Central Europe (2016 data):\n* (ranked 4)\n* (ranked 11)\n* (ranked 12)\n* (ranked 15)\n* (ranked 20)\n* (ranked 27)\n* (ranked 34)\n* (ranked 36)\n* (ranked 43)\n* (ranked 47)\n\nCorruption \n\nMost countries in Central Europe score tend to score above the average in the Corruption Perceptions Index (2015 data):\n* (ranked 7)\n* (ranked 10, tied)\n* (ranked 16, tied)\n* (ranked 30, tied)\n* (ranked 35)\n* (ranked 37, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n\nAccording to the Bribe Payers Index, released yearly since 1995 by the Berlin-based NGO Transparency International, Germany and Switzerland, the only two Central European countries examined in the study, were respectively ranked 2nd and 4th in 2011.\n\nInfrastructure \n\nIndustrialisation occurred early in Central Europe. That caused construction of rail and other types of infrastructure.\n\nRail \n\nCentral Europe contains the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion was recorded in Austro-Hungarian and German territories between 1860-1870s. By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste). Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total length of lines operated (km) per 1,000 km2, is the highest in the Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5). when compared with most of Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nRiver transport and canals \n\nBefore the first railroads appeared in the 1840s, river transport constituted the main means of communication and trade. Earliest canals included Plauen Canal (1745), Finow Canal, and also Bega Canal (1710) which connected Timișoara to Novi Sad and Belgrade via Danube. The most significant achievement in this regard was the facilitation of navigability on Danube from the Black sea to Ulm in the 19th century.\n\nBranches \n\nCompared to most of Europe, the economies of Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland tend to demonstrate high complexity. Industrialisation has reached Central Europe relatively early: Luxembourg and Germany by 1860, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland by 1870, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia by 1880.\n\nAgriculture \n\nCentral European countries are some of the most significant food producers in the world.

It was established in 1991 by the Hungarian philanthropist George Soros, who has provided an endowment of US$880 million, making the university one of the wealthiest in Europe. In the academic year 2013/2014, the CEU had 1,381 students from 93 countries and 388 faculty members from 58 countries.\n\nRegional exchange program \n\nCentral European Exchange Program for University Studies (CEEPUS) is an international exchange program for students and teachers teaching or studying in participating countries. Its current members include (year it joined for the first time in brackets):\n* (2006)\n* (2005)\n* (2008)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n*Kosovo* (2008)\n* (2006)\n* (2011)\n* (2006)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n* (2005)\n\nCulture and society \n\nResearch centres of Central European literature include Harvard (Cambridge, MA), Purdue University\n\nArchitecture \n\nCentral European architecture has been shaped by major European styles including but not limited to: Brick Gothic, Rococo, Secession (art) and Modern architecture.

Large Protestant groups include Lutheran and Calvinist. Significant populations of Eastern Catholicism and Old Catholicism are also prevalent throughout Central Europe. Central Europe has been a centre of Protestantism in the past; however, it has been mostly eradicated by the Counterreformation. The Czech Republic (Bohemia) was historically the first Protestant country, then violently recatholised, and now overwhelmingly non-religious, nevertheless the largest number of religious people are Catholic (10.3%). Romania and Serbia are mostly Eastern Orthodox with significant Protestant and Catholic minorities.\n\nBefore the Holocaust (1941–45), there was also a sizeable Ashkenazi Jewish community in the region, numbering approximately 16.7 million people., based on \n\nIn some of these countries, there is a number of atheists, undeclared and non-religious people: the Czech Republic (non-religious 34.2% and undeclared 45.2%), Germany (non-religious 38%), Slovenia (atheist 30.2%), Luxembourg (25% non-religious), Switzerland (20.1%), Hungary (27.2% undeclared, 16.7% \"non-religious\" and 1.5% atheists), Slovakia (atheists and non-religious 13.4%, \"not specified\" 10.6%) Austria (19.7% of \"other or none\"), Liechtenstein (10.6% with no religion), Croatia (4%) and Poland (3% of non-believers/agnostics and 1% of undeclared).\n\nCentral Europe church buildings gallery \n\nFile:Veitsdom-sideview.jpg|St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague (Catholic), Czech Republic\nFile:Kathedrale - Zagreb - 2010.jpg|Zagreb Cathedral, Zagreb (Catholic), Croatia\nFile:Katedra św.

Most countries share many dishes. The most popular dishes typical to Central Europe are sausages and cheeses, where the earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE (Kujawy, Poland). Other foods widely associated with Central Europe are goulash and beer. List of countries by beer consumption per capita is led by the Czech Republic, followed by Germany and Austria. Poland comes 5th, Croatia 7th and Slovenia 13th.\n\nHuman rights \n\nHistory \n\nHuman rights have a long tradition in Central Europe. In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its \"Golden Bull\". In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.\n\nOn the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as \"Nihil novi\" in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.\n\nPresent \n\nGenerally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as same-sex marriage. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland also have a history of participation in the CIA's extraordinary rendition and detention program, according to the Open Society Foundation.\n\nLiterature \n\nRegional writing tradition revolves around the turbulent history of the region, as well as its cultural diversity. Its existence is sometimes challenged. Specific courses on Central European literature are taught at Stanford University,[https://undergrad.stanford.edu/courses/central-european-literature]  Harvard University and Jagiellonian University The as well as cultural magazines dedicated to regional literature. Angelus Central European Literature Award is an award worth 150,000.00 PLN (about $50,000 or £30,000) for writers originating from the region. Likewise, the Vilenica International Literary Prize is awarded to a Central European author for \"outstanding achievements in the field of literature and essay writing.\"\n\nMedia \n\nThere is a whole spectrum of media active in the region: newspapers, television and internet channels, radio channels, internet websites etc.\nCentral European media are regarded as free, according to the Press Freedom Index, although the situation in Poland, Hungary and Croatia is described as \"problematic\". Some of the top scoring countries are in Central Europe include:\n* (position 7)\n* (position 11)\n* (position 16)\n* (position 17)\n* (position 23)\n* (position 32)\n* (position 37)\n* (position 54)\n* (position 71)\n* (position 74)\n\nSport \n\nThere is a number of Central European Sport events and leagues. They include:\n*Central European Tour Miskolc GP (Hungary)*\n*Central European Tour Budapest GP (Hungary)\n*Central Europe Rally (Romania and Hungary)*\n*Central European Football League (Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey)\n*Central European International Cup (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Switzerland and Yugoslavia; 1927–1960)\n*Central Europe Throwdown*\n\nFootball is one of the most popular sports. Countries of Central Europe had many great national teams throughout history and hosted several major competitions.\nYugoslavia hosted UEFA Euro 1976 before the competition expanded to 8 teams and Germany (at that times as West Germany) hosted UEFA Euro 1988. Recently, 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships were held in Austria & Switzerland and Poland & Ukraine respectively.\nGermany hosted 2 FIFA World Cups (1974 and 2006) and are the current champions (as of 2014).\n\nPolitics \n\nOrganisations \n\nCentral Europe is a birthplace of regional political organisations:\n* Visegrad group\n* Centrope\n* Central European Initiative\n* Central European Free Trade Agreement\n* Middleeuropean Initiative\n* Central European Defence Cooperation\n* Three Seas Initiative\n\nFile:CEI members.png|Central European Initiative\nFile:CEDC.svg|Central European Defence Cooperation\nFile:Visegrad group countries.svg|Visegrád Group\nFile:CEFTA 1992.PNG|CEFTA founding states\nFile:CEFTA 2003.PNG|CEFTA members in 2003, before joining the EU\nFile:Europe-cefta-map.png|Current CEFTA members\nFile:Central Europe Katzenstein.png|Central Europe according to Peter J.

However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism. Most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., Polish people's referendum in 1946) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia). Nevertheless, these experiences have been dealt in most of them. Most of Central European countries score very highly in the Democracy Index:\n*  (position 6)\n*  (position 13)\n*  (position 14)\n*  (position 25)\n*  (position 37)\n*  (position 40)\n*  (position 45)\n*  (position 50)\n*  (position 51)\n*  (not listed)\n\nGlobal Peace Index \n\nIn spite of its turbulent history, Central Europe is currently one of world's safest regions. Most Central European countries are in top 20%:\n* (position 3)\n* (position 5)\n* (position 11)\n* (position 14)\n* (position 17)\n* (position 19)\n* (position 23)\n* (position 22)\n* (position 26)\n* (not listed)\n\nCentral European Time \n\nThe time zone used in most parts of the European Union is a standard time which is 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is commonly called Central European Time because it has been first adopted in central Europe (by year):\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* (1893Since Poland was partitioned since 1922 (official adoption), the dates of introduction in Germany (1893) and Austria (1893) should be understood as de facto adoption)\n*\n*\n*\n\nIn popular culture \n\nCentral Europe is mentioned in 35th episode of Lovejoy, entitled \"The Prague Sun\", filmed in 1992. While walking over the famous Charles Bridge, the main character, Lovejoy says: \" I've never been to Prague before. Well, it is one of the great unspoiled cities in Central Europe. Notice: I said: \"Central\", not \"Eastern\"! The Czechs are a bit funny about that, they think of Eastern Europeans as turnip heads.\"\n\nWes Anderson's Oscar-winning film The Grand Budapest Hotel is regarded as a fictionalised celebration of the 1930s in Central Europe and region's musical tastes",

Central Europe is going through a phase of \"strategic awakening\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope and the Visegrád Four. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121150504/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2010_EN_Table1.pdf 2010 Human Development Index].

However Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), Eastern Europe developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Church Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nFile:Carolingian empire 843 888.jpg|Frankish Empire and its tributaries (AD 843-888)\nFile:Great Moravia Svatopluk.jpg|alt=Moravia under Svatopluk|Certain and disputed borders of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I (AD 870–894)\nFile:Church in poland 12-13c.svg|Kingdom of Poland in late 12th-13th centuries.\nFile:Karte Böhmen unter Ottokar II.png|Bohemia in 1273\nFile:Europe mediterranean 1190 cropped.jpg|Kingdom of Hungary in 1190\nFile:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|Holy Roman Empire in 1600 superimposed on modern state borders\n\nAccording to Hungarian historian Jenő Szűcs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.\n\nIn 1335 under the rule of the King Charles I of Hungary, the castle of Visegrád, the seat of the Hungarian monarchs was the scene of the royal summit of the Kings of Poland, Bohemia and Hungary. They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful Central European initiative.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted Magdeburg rights.\n\nBefore World War I \n\nBefore 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in Eastern Europe, industrialization lagged far behind. Russia, for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.Jackson J. Spielvogel: Western Civilization: Alternate Volume: Since 1300. p. 618.\nThe concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century, but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called Mitteleuropa. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from Rhine to Vistula, or even Dnieper, and from the Baltic Sea to the Balkans.A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004 An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, Central Europe, New York 1903\n\nOn 21 January 1904, Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein (Central European Economic Association) was established in Berlin with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The \"bible\" of the concept was Friedrich Naumann’s book MitteleuropaF. Naumann, Mitteleuropa, Berlin: Reimer, 1915 in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its centre Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other. The concept failed after the German defeat in World War I and the dissolution of Austria–Hungary. The revival of the idea may be observed during the Hitler era.\n\nInterwar period \n\nAccording to Emmanuel de Martonne, in 1927 the Central European countries included: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Switzerland. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; Géographie universelle (1927), edited by Paul Vidal de la Blache and Lucien Gallois\n\nThe interwar period (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of \"new\" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither Little Entente nor Intermarium (Międzymorze) ideas succeeded.\n\nThe interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, Austria), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance. After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in Brussels in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.\n\nHungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study Versailles System and Central Europe (2006): \"Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the Little Entente, military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down\".\n\nThe avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The Sourcebook of Central European avantgards (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, and Poland from 1910 to 1930. The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.\n\nMitteleuropa \n\nThe German term Mitteleuropa (or alternatively its literal translation into English, Middle EuropeJohnson, p. 165) is an ambiguous German concept. It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic cultural hegemony until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the Baltic countries north of East Prussia). According to Fritz Fischer Mitteleuropa was a scheme in the era of the Reich of 1871–1918 by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.Hayes, p. 16 Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic \"Drang nach Westen\" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a Mitteleuropa ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.Hayes, p. 17\n\nIn Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union, and ethnically cleansed of Germans by communist authorities and forces (see expulsion of Germans after World War II) due to Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference decisions. In this view Bohemia and Moravia, with its dual Western Slavic and Germanic heritage, combined with the historic element of the \"Sudetenland\", is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.\n\nThe term \"Mitteleuropa\" conjures up negative historical associations among some elder people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.Johnson, p. 6 Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.Johnson, p. 7 German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century Vienna, Budapest and Prague became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of \"Mitteleuropa\" destroyed this kind of culture instead.Johnson, p. 170 However, the term \"Mitteleuropa\" is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism. In fact, many people from the new states of Germany do not identify themselves as being part of Western Europe and therefore prefer the term \"Mitteleuropa\".\n\nCentral Europe behind the Iron Curtain \n\nFollowing World War II, large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the Eastern bloc. Czech author Milan Kundera (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the \"Tragedy of Central Europe\" in the New York Review of Books. Consequently, the English term Central Europe was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe. This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.\n\nThe post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the Eastern Bloc countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the Stalinist doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book The limits and divisions of European history, London and New York 1950 At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004\n\nAccording to Karl A. Sinnhuber (Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term) most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides Austria, only marginal Central European states of Finland and Yugoslavia did preserve their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out from any military alliances in Europe.\n\nAccording to Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon,Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980 Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Switzerland, and northern marginal regions of Italy and Yugoslavia (northern states – Croatia, Vojvodina and Slovenia), as well as northeastern France.\n\nCurrent views \n\nRather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.\n\nMain propositions, gathered by Jerzy Kłoczowski, include:Jerzy Kłoczowski, Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 \n* West-Central and East-Central Europe – this conception, presented in 1950,Oskar Halecki, The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed & Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the Reich, and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations from Finland to Greece, placed between great empires of Scandinavia, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union.\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth – Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with Polish historians, insist on the importance of the concept.\n* Central Europe as a region connected to the Western civilisation for a very long time, including countries such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kingdom of Croatia, Holy Roman Empire, later German Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Crown of Bohemia. Central Europe understood in this way borders on Russia and South-Eastern Europe, but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later Austria-Hungary) – a concept which is popular in regions along the Danube River.\n\n* A concept underlining the links connecting Belarus and Ukraine with Russia and treating the Russian Empire together with the whole Slavic Orthodox population as one entity – this position is taken by the Russian historiography.\n* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the South-Eastern states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the \"East Centre\" expressing their links with the Western culture.\n\nAccording to Ronald Tiersky, the 1991 summit held in Visegrád, Hungary and attended by the Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the Visegrád Group became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.Tiersky, p. 472\n\nPeter J. Katzenstein described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the Visegrád Group countries in different, though comparable ways.Katzenstein, p. 6 According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse \"Central European identity\" refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.Katzenstein, p. 4\n\nLonnie R. Johnson points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from Western, Eastern and Southeast Europe:Lonnie R. Johnson \"Central Europe: enemies, neighbors, friends\", Oxford University Press, 1996 \n* One criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the Roman Catholic West and the Orthodox East.Johnson, p.4 The pagans of Central Europe were converted to Roman Catholicism while in Southeastern and Eastern Europe they were brought into the fold of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.Johnson, p. 4 Hungary and Poland, small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories. The historical Kingdom of Hungary was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today, while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the 16th century. Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples.\n\nHe also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamic historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, Lithuania, a fair share of Belarus and western Ukraine are in Eastern Europe today, but  years ago they were in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Johnson's study on Central Europe received acclaim and positive reviews in the scientific community. However, according to Romanian researcher Maria Bucur this very ambitious project suffers from the weaknesses imposed by its scope (almost 1600 years of history).\n\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia defines Central Europe as: Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. The World Factbook uses the same definition adding Slovenia too. Encarta Encyclopedia and Encyclopædia Britannica do not clearly define the region, but Encarta places the same countries into Central Europe in its individual articles on countries, adding Slovenia in \"south central Europe\".\n\nThe German Encyclopaedia Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon (Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the Schelde to Vistula and from the Danube to the Moravian Gate. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland; in the broader sense Romania too, occasionally also Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nStates \n\nThe comprehension of the concept of Central Europe is an ongoing source of controversy, though the Visegrád Group constituents are almost always included as de facto C.E. countries. Although views on which countries belong to Central Europe are vastly varied, according to many sources (see section Current views on Central Europe) the region includes the states listed in the sections below.\n\n*\n*Lonnie Johnson, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Central_Europe.html?id\ne_m13Hk3AFEC&redir_esc=y Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends], Oxford University Press (alternatively placed in Southeastern Europe)Andrew Geddes, Charles Lees, Andrew Taylor : \"The European Union and South East Europe: The Dynamics of Europeanization and multilevel governance\", 2013, RoutledgeKlaus Liebscher, Josef Christl, Peter Mooslechner, Doris Ritzberger-Grünwald : \"European Economic Integration and South-East Europe: Challenges and Prospects\", 2005, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* (sometimes placed in Southeastern Europe)\n*\n\nDepending on context, Central European countries are sometimes grouped as Eastern or Western European countries, collectively or individually but some place them in Eastern Europe instead: for instance Austria can be referred to as Central European, as well as Eastern European or Western European.\n\nOther countries and regions \n\nSome sources also add neighbouring countries for historical reasons (the former Austro-Hungarian and German Empires, and modern Baltic states), or based on geographical and/or cultural reasons:\n\n* (TransylvaniaSven Tägil, [https://books.google.com/books?idll-6JYQyPsIC&pg\nPA191&dqTransylvania+%22Central+Europe%22&hl\nen&saX&ei\nLy7HT_mtM4mZhQeQiM2NCw&sqi2&ved\n0CDcQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nTransylvania%20%22Central%20Europe%22&ffalse Regions in Central Europe: The Legacy of History], C.

Benelux countries are generally considered a part of Western Europe, rather than Central Europe. Nevertheless, they are occasionally mentioned in the Central European context due to cultural, historical and linguistic ties.\n\nThe following states or some of their regions may sometimes be included in Central Europe:\n* (South Tyrol, Trentino, Trieste and Gorizia, Friuli, occasionally Veneto or all of Northern Italy)\n* (Transcarpathia, Galicia and Northern Bukovina)\n\nGeography \n\nGeography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the North across the Baltic Sea namely the Northern Europe (or Scandinavia), and to the South across the Alps, the Apennine peninsula (or Italy), and the Balkan peninsula across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to Western Europe and Eastern Europe are geographically less defined and for this reason the cultural and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The Rhine river which runs South-North through Western Germany is an exception.\n\nSouthwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube- and their respective floodplains.[http://www.icpdr.org/main/sites/default/files/BA%20Facts%20Figures.pdf Danube Facts and Figures. Bosnia and Herzegovina (April 2007)] (PDF file) The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) and Ukraine (\"peri- Pannonian states\").\n\nAs southeastern division of the Eastern Alps, the Dinaric Alps extend for 650 kilometres along the coast of the Adriatic Sea (northwest-southeast), from the Julian Alps in the northwest down to the Šar-Korab massif, north-south. According to the Freie Universitaet Berlin, this mountain chain is classified as South Central European.\n\nThe Central European flora region stretches from Central France (the Massif Central) to Central Romania (Carpathians) and Southern Scandinavia.Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch; Lehrbuch der Geobotanik. Pflanze und Vegetation in Raum und Zeit. Elsevier, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, München 2004 \n\nAt times, the term \"Central Europe\" denotes a geographic definition as the Danube region in the heart of the continent, including the language and culture areas which are today included in the states of Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and usually also Austria and Germany, but never Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union towards the Ural mountains.\n\nStatistics \n\nData \n\n*Area: 1.036.370 km2 (2012) \n*Population: (calculated data) 163.518.571 (July 2012) \n*Population density: (calculated data) 157.78/km2 (2012) \n*GDP (PPP) per capita: US$34.444 (2012) \n*Life expectancy: (calculated data) 78.32-year (2012) \n*Unemployment rate: 8.2% (2012) \n*Fertility rate: 1.41 births/woman (2012) \n*Human Development Index: 0.874 (2012) (very high) \n*Globalization Index (regional): 80.09 (2013) There is no data in the Liechtenstein of economic globalization\n\nDemography \n\nCentral Europe is one of continent's most populous regions. It includes countries of varied sizes, ranging from tiny Liechtenstein to Germany, the largest European country by population (that is entirely placed in Europe). Demographic figures for countries entirely located within notion of Central Europe (\"the core countries\") number around 165 million people, out of which around 82 million are residents of Germany. Other populations include: Poland with around 38.5 million residents, Czech Republic at 10.5 million, Hungary at 10 million, Austria with 8.5 million, Switzerland with its 8 million inhabitants, Slovakia at 5.4 million, Croatia with its 4.3 million residents, Slovenia at 2 million (2014 estimate) and Liechtenstein at a bit less than 40,000.\n\nIf the countries which are occasionally included in Central Europe were counted in, partially or in whole – Romania (20 million), Serbia (6.9 million), Lithuania (2.9 million), Latvia (2 million), Estonia (1.3 million) – it would contribute to the rise of between 25–35 million, depending on whether regional or integral approach was used. If smaller, western and eastern historical parts of Central Europe would be included in the demographic corpus, further 20 million people of different nationalities would also be added in the overall count, it would surpass the 200 million people figure.\n\nEconomy \n\nCurrencies \n\nCurrently, the members of the Eurozone include Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland use their currencies (Croatian kuna, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish złoty), but are obliged to adopt the Euro. Switzerland uses its own currency, Swiss franc.\n\nHuman Development Index \n\nCountries in descending order of Human Development Index (2014 data):\n*: 0.917  (ranked 3)\n*: 0.911  (ranked 6)\n*: 0.889  (ranked 18)\n*: 0.881  (ranked 21)\n*: 0.874  (ranked 25)\n*: 0.861  (ranked 28)\n*: 0.834  (ranked 35)\n*: 0.830  (ranked 37)\n*: 0.818  (ranked 43)\n*: 0.812  (ranked 47)\n\nGlobalisation \n\nThe index of globalization in Central European countries (2015 data):\n\n*: 89.83 (ranked 4)\n*: 87.01 (ranked 5)\n*: 85.78 (ranked 9)\n*: 83.62 (ranked 16)\n*: 83.60 (ranked 17)\n*: 83.55 (ranked 18)\n*: 79.90 (ranked 23)\n*: 78.24 (ranked 27)\n*: 76.24 (ranked 32)\n*: 75.59 (ranked 35)\n*: not listed (ranked 180 in 2015 with 29.23)\n\nProsperity Index \n\nLegatum Prosperity Index demonstrates an average and high level of prosperity in Central Europe (2016 data):\n* (ranked 4)\n* (ranked 11)\n* (ranked 12)\n* (ranked 15)\n* (ranked 20)\n* (ranked 27)\n* (ranked 34)\n* (ranked 36)\n* (ranked 43)\n* (ranked 47)\n\nCorruption \n\nMost countries in Central Europe score tend to score above the average in the Corruption Perceptions Index (2015 data):\n* (ranked 7)\n* (ranked 10, tied)\n* (ranked 16, tied)\n* (ranked 30, tied)\n* (ranked 35)\n* (ranked 37, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n* (ranked 50, tied)\n\nAccording to the Bribe Payers Index, released yearly since 1995 by the Berlin-based NGO Transparency International, Germany and Switzerland, the only two Central European countries examined in the study, were respectively ranked 2nd and 4th in 2011.\n\nInfrastructure \n\nIndustrialisation occurred early in Central Europe. That caused construction of rail and other types of infrastructure.\n\nRail \n\nCentral Europe contains the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion was recorded in Austro-Hungarian and German territories between 1860-1870s. By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste). Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total length of lines operated (km) per 1,000 km2, is the highest in the Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5). when compared with most of Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nRiver transport and canals \n\nBefore the first railroads appeared in the 1840s, river transport constituted the main means of communication and trade. Earliest canals included Plauen Canal (1745), Finow Canal, and also Bega Canal (1710) which connected Timișoara to Novi Sad and Belgrade via Danube. The most significant achievement in this regard was the facilitation of navigability on Danube from the Black sea to Ulm in the 19th century.\n\nBranches \n\nCompared to most of Europe, the economies of Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland tend to demonstrate high complexity. Industrialisation has reached Central Europe relatively early: Luxembourg and Germany by 1860, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland by 1870, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia by 1880.\n\nAgriculture \n\nCentral European countries are some of the most significant food producers in the world. Germany is the world's largest hops producer with 34.27% share in 2010,Gnel Gabrielyan, [http://www.impact.wsu.edu/MarshFiles/AAEA%20Domestic%20and%20International%20Price%20Formation%20of%20US%20Hops.pdf Domestic and Export Price Formation of U.S. Hops]  School of Economic Sciences at Washington State University.

Six Central European countries are amongst those countries with higher numbers of World Heritage Sites:\n* (position 5th, 42 sites)\n* (position 18th, 16 sites)\n* (position 22th, 12 sites)\n* (position 25th, 12 sites)\n* (position 27th, 10 sites)\n* (position 29th, 10 sites)\n\nReligion \n\nCentral European countries are mostly Roman Catholic (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia) or mixed Catholic and Protestant, (Germany and Switzerland).  Large Protestant groups include Lutheran and Calvinist. Significant populations of Eastern Catholicism and Old Catholicism are also prevalent throughout Central Europe. Central Europe has been a centre of Protestantism in the past; however, it has been mostly eradicated by the Counterreformation. The Czech Republic (Bohemia) was historically the first Protestant country, then violently recatholised, and now overwhelmingly non-religious, nevertheless the largest number of religious people are Catholic (10.3%). Romania and Serbia are mostly Eastern Orthodox with significant Protestant and Catholic minorities.\n\nBefore the Holocaust (1941–45), there was also a sizeable Ashkenazi Jewish community in the region, numbering approximately 16.7 million people., based on \n\nIn some of these countries, there is a number of atheists, undeclared and non-religious people: the Czech Republic (non-religious 34.2% and undeclared 45.2%), Germany (non-religious 38%), Slovenia (atheist 30.2%), Luxembourg (25% non-religious), Switzerland (20.1%), Hungary (27.2% undeclared, 16.7% \"non-religious\" and 1.5% atheists), Slovakia (atheists and non-religious 13.4%, \"not specified\" 10.6%) Austria (19.7% of \"other or none\"), Liechtenstein (10.6% with no religion), Croatia (4%) and Poland (3% of non-believers/agnostics and 1% of undeclared).\n\nCentral Europe church buildings gallery \n\nFile:Veitsdom-sideview.jpg|St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague (Catholic), Czech Republic\nFile:Kathedrale - Zagreb - 2010.jpg|Zagreb Cathedral, Zagreb (Catholic), Croatia\nFile:Katedra św.

Most countries share many dishes. The most popular dishes typical to Central Europe are sausages and cheeses, where the earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE (Kujawy, Poland). Other foods widely associated with Central Europe are goulash and beer. List of countries by beer consumption per capita is led by the Czech Republic, followed by Germany and Austria. Poland comes 5th, Croatia 7th and Slovenia 13th.\n\nHuman rights \n\nHistory \n\nHuman rights have a long tradition in Central Europe. In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its \"Golden Bull\". In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.\n\nOn the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as \"Nihil novi\" in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.\n\nPresent \n\nGenerally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as same-sex marriage. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland also have a history of participation in the CIA's extraordinary rendition and detention program, according to the Open Society Foundation.\n\nLiterature \n\nRegional writing tradition revolves around the turbulent history of the region, as well as its cultural diversity. Its existence is sometimes challenged. Specific courses on Central European literature are taught at Stanford University,[https://undergrad.stanford.edu/courses/central-european-literature]  Harvard University and Jagiellonian University The as well as cultural magazines dedicated to regional literature. Angelus Central European Literature Award is an award worth 150,000.00 PLN (about $50,000 or £30,000) for writers originating from the region. Likewise, the Vilenica International Literary Prize is awarded to a Central European author for \"outstanding achievements in the field of literature and essay writing.\"\n\nMedia \n\nThere is a whole spectrum of media active in the region: newspapers, television and internet channels, radio channels, internet websites etc.\nCentral European media are regarded as free, according to the Press Freedom Index, although the situation in Poland, Hungary and Croatia is described as \"problematic\". Some of the top scoring countries are in Central Europe include:\n* (position 7)\n* (position 11)\n* (position 16)\n* (position 17)\n* (position 23)\n* (position 32)\n* (position 37)\n* (position 54)\n* (position 71)\n* (position 74)\n\nSport \n\nThere is a number of Central European Sport events and leagues. They include:\n*Central European Tour Miskolc GP (Hungary)*\n*Central European Tour Budapest GP (Hungary)\n*Central Europe Rally (Romania and Hungary)*\n*Central European Football League (Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey)\n*Central European International Cup (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Switzerland and Yugoslavia; 1927–1960)\n*Central Europe Throwdown*\n\nFootball is one of the most popular sports. Countries of Central Europe had many great national teams throughout history and hosted several major competitions.\nYugoslavia hosted UEFA Euro 1976 before the competition expanded to 8 teams and Germany (at that times as West Germany) hosted UEFA Euro 1988. Recently, 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships were held in Austria & Switzerland and Poland & Ukraine respectively.\nGermany hosted 2 FIFA World Cups (1974 and 2006) and are the current champions (as of 2014).\n\nPolitics \n\nOrganisations \n\nCentral Europe is a birthplace of regional political organisations:\n* Visegrad group\n* Centrope\n* Central European Initiative\n* Central European Free Trade Agreement\n* Middleeuropean Initiative\n* Central European Defence Cooperation\n* Three Seas Initiative\n\nFile:CEI members.png|Central European Initiative\nFile:CEDC.svg|Central European Defence Cooperation\nFile:Visegrad group countries.svg|Visegrád Group\nFile:CEFTA 1992.PNG|CEFTA founding states\nFile:CEFTA 2003.PNG|CEFTA members in 2003, before joining the EU\nFile:Europe-cefta-map.png|Current CEFTA members\nFile:Central Europe Katzenstein.png|Central Europe according to Peter J.

However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism. Most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., Polish people's referendum in 1946) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia). Nevertheless, these experiences have been dealt in most of them. Most of Central European countries score very highly in the Democracy Index:\n*  (position 6)\n*  (position 13)\n*  (position 14)\n*  (position 25)\n*  (position 37)\n*  (position 40)\n*  (position 45)\n*  (position 50)\n*  (position 51)\n*  (not listed)\n\nGlobal Peace Index \n\nIn spite of its turbulent history, Central Europe is currently one of world's safest regions. Most Central European countries are in top 20%:\n* (position 3)\n* (position 5)\n* (position 11)\n* (position 14)\n* (position 17)\n* (position 19)\n* (position 23)\n* (position 22)\n* (position 26)\n* (not listed)\n\nCentral European Time \n\nThe time zone used in most parts of the European Union is a standard time which is 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is commonly called Central European Time because it has been first adopted in central Europe (by year):\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* (1893Since Poland was partitioned since 1922 (official adoption), the dates of introduction in Germany (1893) and Austria (1893) should be understood as de facto adoption)\n*\n*\n*\n\nIn popular culture \n\nCentral Europe is mentioned in 35th episode of Lovejoy, entitled \"The Prague Sun\", filmed in 1992. While walking over the famous Charles Bridge, the main character, Lovejoy says: \" I've never been to Prague before. Well, it is one of the great unspoiled cities in Central Europe. Notice: I said: \"Central\", not \"Eastern\"! The Czechs are a bit funny about that, they think of Eastern Europeans as turnip heads.\"\n\nWes Anderson's Oscar-winning film The Grand Budapest Hotel is regarded as a fictionalised celebration of the 1930s in Central Europe and region's musical tastes.
