  "textBody" : "Des Moines is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is on and named after the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the French colonial name, Rivière des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 216,553 as of the 2017 population estimate. The five-county metropolitan area is ranked 89th in terms of population in the United States with 634,725 residents according to the 2016 estimate by the United States Census Bureau.\n\nDes Moines is a major center of the U.S. insurance industry, and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and Pioneer Hi-Bred have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.[http://www.today.com/money/des-moines-where-regular-folks-can-live-rich-life-2D11965288 \"Des Moines, where regular folks can live rich life\"], Today show, NBC, 2014\n\nDes Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\nEtymology\n\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced, formerly) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, the Algonquian clan name for \"Loon\".Vogel, Virgil (1983) Iowa Place Names of Indian Origin University of Iowa Press, Iowa City.\n\nSome historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.\n\nOne popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the current city of St. Louis. This was some 200 mi from the Des Moines River.\"[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 Defining 'Des Moines'] \", Des Moines Register, September 14, 2003.\n\nPrehistory\n\nPrehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.\n\nAt least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin of Fort Des Moines\n\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.\n\nArchaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street.Mather, David and Ginalie Swaim (2005) \"The Heart of the Best Part: Fort Des Moines No. 2 and the Archaeology of a City,\" Iowa Heritage Illustrated 86(1):12–21. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.James H. Lees, \"History of Coal Mining in Iowa,\" Chapter III of [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA566 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, p. 566\n\nEarly, non-Native American, settlement\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses...The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.Perkins, Arozina, 1851 letter in: (1984) \"Teaching in Fort Des Moines, Iowa: November 13, 1850 to March 21, 1851.\" In Women Teachers on the Frontier, edited by P. W. Kaufman, pp. 126–143. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\"Mills and Company (1866) Des Moines City Directory and Business Guide. Des Moines, Iowa: Mills and Company, p. 6. Microfilm, State Historical Society Library, Iowa City. The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\nEra of growth\n\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.Brigham, Johnson (1911) Des Moines: The Pioneer of Municipal Progress and Reform of the Middle West. Volume 1. Chicago: S. J. Clarke\n\nIn 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150 ft mine shaft to reach a 5 ft coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region.James H. Lees, \"History of Coal Mining in Iowa,\" Chapter III of [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA566 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 566–569. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted.Henry Hinds, \"The Coal Deposits of Iowa,\" [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA121 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 121–127, and see map on page 102. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners.Tally Sheet, [https://books.google.com/books?idcfAUAAAAIAAJ&pg\nRA1-PA1005 Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Convention of the United Mine Workers of America], Jan 16 – February 2, 1912, Indianapolis; Volume 2, pages 180A-184A. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\n\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\n\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s.Dahl, Orin L. (1978) Des Moines: Capital City: A Pictorial and Entertaining Commentary on the Growth and Development of Des Moines, Iowa. Continental Heritage, Tulsa.Gardiner, Allen (2004) Des Moines: A History in Pictures. Heritage Media, San Marcos, California. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\nThis form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\n\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\n\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally planning growth and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\nCityscape\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed during the 1970s and 1980s, as several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\n\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 mi long and connects many downtown buildings.[http://www.seedesmoines.com/get_around/skywalks.php Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau] . Seedesmoines.com (July 21, 1998). Retrieved on September 5, 2013.[http://www.gannett.com/about/map/ataglance/desmoin.htm ] \n\nIn the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\n\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Dr. Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\n\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is  covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\n\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex certain parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period of time.\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, and Madison. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 611,549. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those four counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\nClimate\n\nLocated at the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 °F range, occasionally reaching 100 °F. Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 °F quite often. Snowfall averages  per season, and annual precipitation averages , with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\nDemographics\n\n2010 census\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

With its picturesque views, the lush, 10 acre \"people's park\" at the foot of the Capitol complex includes a promenade and landscaped gardens, in addition to providing public space for rallies and special events. A granite map of Iowa depicting all 99 counties rests at the base of the terrace and has become a popular attraction for in-state visitors, many of whom can be seen walking over the map to find their home county.\n\nIowa's history lives on in the State of Iowa Historical Museum. This modern granite and glass structure at the foot of the State Capitol Building houses permanent and temporary exhibits exploring the people, places, events, and issues of Iowa's past. The showcase includes native wildlife, American Indian and pioneer artifacts, and political and military items. The museum features a genealogy and Iowa history library, museum gift shop, and cafe.\n\nTerrace Hill, a National Historic Landmark and Iowa Governor's Residence, is among the best examples of American Victorian Second Empire architecture. This opulent 1869 home was built by Iowa's first millionaire, Benjamin F. Allen, and restored to the late 19th century period. It overlooks downtown Des Moines and is situated on 8 acre with a re-created Victorian formal garden. Tours are conducted Tuesdays through Saturdays from March through December.\n\nThe 110000 sqft Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater offers seven interactive learning areas, live programs, and hands-on activities encouraging learning and fun for all ages.

On Saturdays from May through October, the popular Downtown Farmers' Market draws visitors from across the state and is ranked the second best market in the country. Popular parades include Saint Patrick's Day Parade, Drake Relays Parade, Capitol City Pride Parade, Iowa State Fair Parade, Labor Day Parade, and Beaverdale Fall Festival Parade.\n\nOther annual festivals and events include: Des Moines Beer Week, 80/35 Music Festival, 515 Alive Music Festival, ArtFest Midwest, Blue Ribbon Bacon Fest, CelebrAsian Heritage Festival, Des Moines Pride Festival, Des Moines Renaissance Faire, Festa Italiana, Festival of Trees and Lights, World Food & Music Festival, I'll Make Me a World Iowa, Latino Heritage Festival, Oktoberfest, WineFest, ImaginEve!, Iowa's Premier Beer, Wine & Food Show, and Wild Rose Film Festival.\n\nMuseums\n\n* Des Moines Art Center\n* Des Moines Police Museum & Historical Society\n* Fort Des Moines Museum and Education Center\n* Jordan House Museum\n* Salisbury House\n* Science Center of Iowa\n* State Historical Society of Iowa\n* Terrace Hill – Official residence of the Governor of Iowa\n* Wallace House Museum\n* World Food Prize Hall of Laureates\n* Wells Fargo History Museum\n\nGovernment\n\nDes Moines currently operates under a council–manager form of government. The council consists of a mayor (currently, Frank Cownie) and is elected in citywide vote, two at-large members, and four members representing each of the city's four wards. In 2014, Jonathan Gano was appointed as the new Public Works Director. In 2015, Dana Wingert was appointed as Police Chief and Pam Cooksey was appointed as the new City Engineer.\n\nThe current council members include:\n\nA plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The consolidated city-county government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would have still retained its individual government but had the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, many city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.\n\nTransportation\n\nDes Moines has an extensive skywalk system within its downtown core. With over four miles of enclosed walkway, it is one of the largest of such systems in the United States. The Des Moines Skywalk System has been criticized for hurting street-level business, though a recent initiative has been made to make street-level Skywalk entrances more visible.\n\nInterstate 235 (I-235) cuts through the city, and I-35 and I-80 both pass through the Des Moines metropolitan area, as well as the city of Des Moines. On the northern side of the city of Des Moines and passing through the cities of Altoona, Clive, Johnston, Urbandale and West Des Moines, I-35 and I-80 converge into a long concurrency while I-235 takes a direct route through Des Moines, Windsor Heights, and West Des Moines before meeting up with I-35 and I-80 on the western edge of the metro. Des Moines' freeway design makes it easy for travelers. A motorist who misses an exit at the interstate \"mixmasters\" at the eastern and western edges of the metro eventually ends up at the convergence of the same interstates at the opposite side of the metro. These Interstates include I-35, I-80, and I-235. I-235, which takes the brunt of most congestion, is six lanes throughout the entire length and expands to eight and ten lanes near the downtown area. The remainder of traffic congestion in the area occurs near the East and West Mixmasters on either side of Des Moines. I-35 south of the West Mixmaster is currently being widened to six lanes all the way to the Iowa Highway 5 (Iowa 5) bypass interchanges.\n\nDue to increasing budget constraints, the city of Des Moines implemented a speeding camera program along I-235 to gain revenue through the most densely populated parts of Greater Des Moines. The East Mixmaster has also undergone a redesign with wider lanes and redesign of bridges allowing easier traffic flow in all directions along I-35, I-80, and I-235. U.S. Highway 65 (US 65) and Iowa 5 form a freeway loop, known as the \"South Belt Freeway,\" to the east and south of the city, providing a route through the southern part of the metropolitan area. US 6, US 69, Iowa 28, Iowa 141, Iowa 163, Iowa 330, and Iowa 415 are also important routes to and within the city.\n\nThere have been proposals to convert Iowa 5 and US 65, the \"South Belt Freeway,\" into what would be renamed Interstate 335, giving the Des Moines Metropolitan Area an interstate running from the northeast suburb of Altoona to the southeastern suburb of Carlisle and then connect with I-35 in the southern part of West Des Moines.\n\nDes Moines's public transit system, operated by DART (Des Moines Area Regional Transit), which was the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority until October 2006, consists entirely of buses, including regular in-city routes and express and commuter buses to outlying suburban areas.  In 2008, a light rail system was proposed for Des Moines, but, , it has yet to receive funding or popular support.\n\nBurlington Trailways, Jefferson Lines, and Megabus run long-distance, inter-city bus routes through Des Moines.\n\nAlthough Des Moines was historically a train hub, it does not currently have passenger train service. For east-west traffic it was served by The Rock Island's Corn Belt Rocket express from Omaha to the west, to Chicago in the east. The Rock Island also offered the Twin Star Rocket to Minneapolis to the north and Dallas and Houston to the south. Northward and northwest bound, there were Chicago and North Western trains to destinations including Minneapolis. The Wabash Railroad ran service to the southeast to St. Louis.\n\nThe nearest Amtrak station is Osceola, about 40 mi south of Des Moines, with no connecting Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach.  Osceola is served by the California Zephyr, running between Chicago and Emeryville, CA.  Note that while this source is suggestive, it is not : the map does not include all stations, due to the zoom (c.f. the tiny print).   There have been proposals to extend the upcoming Quad Cities Amtrak service along the Iowa Interstate Railroad main line to Des Moines proper. \n\nThe Des Moines International Airport (DSM), located on Fleur Drive in the southern part of Des Moines, offers nonstop service to destinations within the United States. Currently the only international service is cargo service, but there have been discussions about adding an international terminal.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Des Moines Public Schools district is the largest community school district in Iowa with 32,062 enrolled students as of the 2012–2013 school year. The district consists of 63 schools: 38 elementary schools, eleven middle schools, five high schools (East, Hoover, Lincoln, North, and Roosevelt), and ten special schools and programs.

    "aggregatedText" : "Des Moines is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is on and named after the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the French colonial name, Rivière des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 216,553 as of the 2017 population estimate. The five-county metropolitan area is ranked 89th in terms of population in the United States with 634,725 residents according to the 2016 estimate by the United States Census Bureau.\n\nDes Moines is a major center of the U.S. insurance industry, and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and Pioneer Hi-Bred have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.[http://www.today.com/money/des-moines-where-regular-folks-can-live-rich-life-2D11965288 \"Des Moines, where regular folks can live rich life\"], Today show, NBC, 2014\n\nDes Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\nEtymology\n\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced, formerly) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, the Algonquian clan name for \"Loon\".Vogel, Virgil (1983) Iowa Place Names of Indian Origin University of Iowa Press, Iowa City.\n\nSome historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.\n\nOne popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the current city of St. Louis. This was some 200 mi from the Des Moines River.\"[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 Defining 'Des Moines'] \", Des Moines Register, September 14, 2003.\n\nPrehistory\n\nPrehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.\n\nAt least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin of Fort Des Moines\n\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.\n\nArchaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street.Mather, David and Ginalie Swaim (2005) \"The Heart of the Best Part: Fort Des Moines No. 2 and the Archaeology of a City,\" Iowa Heritage Illustrated 86(1):12–21. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.James H. Lees, \"History of Coal Mining in Iowa,\" Chapter III of [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA566 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, p. 566\n\nEarly, non-Native American, settlement\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses...The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.Perkins, Arozina, 1851 letter in: (1984) \"Teaching in Fort Des Moines, Iowa: November 13, 1850 to March 21, 1851.\" In Women Teachers on the Frontier, edited by P. W. Kaufman, pp. 126–143. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\"Mills and Company (1866) Des Moines City Directory and Business Guide. Des Moines, Iowa: Mills and Company, p. 6. Microfilm, State Historical Society Library, Iowa City. The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\nEra of growth\n\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.Brigham, Johnson (1911) Des Moines: The Pioneer of Municipal Progress and Reform of the Middle West. Volume 1. Chicago: S. J. Clarke\n\nIn 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150 ft mine shaft to reach a 5 ft coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region.James H. Lees, \"History of Coal Mining in Iowa,\" Chapter III of [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA566 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 566–569. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted.Henry Hinds, \"The Coal Deposits of Iowa,\" [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpgPA415&pg\nPA121 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 121–127, and see map on page 102. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners.Tally Sheet, [https://books.google.com/books?idcfAUAAAAIAAJ&pg\nRA1-PA1005 Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Convention of the United Mine Workers of America], Jan 16 – February 2, 1912, Indianapolis; Volume 2, pages 180A-184A. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\n\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\n\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s.Dahl, Orin L. (1978) Des Moines: Capital City: A Pictorial and Entertaining Commentary on the Growth and Development of Des Moines, Iowa. Continental Heritage, Tulsa.Gardiner, Allen (2004) Des Moines: A History in Pictures. Heritage Media, San Marcos, California. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\nThis form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\n\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\n\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally planning growth and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\nCityscape\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed during the 1970s and 1980s, as several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\n\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 mi long and connects many downtown buildings.[http://www.seedesmoines.com/get_around/skywalks.php Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau] . Seedesmoines.com (July 21, 1998). Retrieved on September 5, 2013.[http://www.gannett.com/about/map/ataglance/desmoin.htm ] \n\nIn the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\n\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Dr. Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\n\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is  covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\n\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex certain parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period of time.\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, and Madison. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 611,549. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those four counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\nClimate\n\nLocated at the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 °F range, occasionally reaching 100 °F. Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 °F quite often.

Popular parades include Saint Patrick's Day Parade, Drake Relays Parade, Capitol City Pride Parade, Iowa State Fair Parade, Labor Day Parade, and Beaverdale Fall Festival Parade.\n\nOther annual festivals and events include: Des Moines Beer Week, 80/35 Music Festival, 515 Alive Music Festival, ArtFest Midwest, Blue Ribbon Bacon Fest, CelebrAsian Heritage Festival, Des Moines Pride Festival, Des Moines Renaissance Faire, Festa Italiana, Festival of Trees and Lights, World Food & Music Festival, I'll Make Me a World Iowa, Latino Heritage Festival, Oktoberfest, WineFest, ImaginEve!, Iowa's Premier Beer, Wine & Food Show, and Wild Rose Film Festival.\n\nMuseums\n\n* Des Moines Art Center\n* Des Moines Police Museum & Historical Society\n* Fort Des Moines Museum and Education Center\n* Jordan House Museum\n* Salisbury House\n* Science Center of Iowa\n* State Historical Society of Iowa\n* Terrace Hill – Official residence of the Governor of Iowa\n* Wallace House Museum\n* World Food Prize Hall of Laureates\n* Wells Fargo History Museum\n\nGovernment\n\nDes Moines currently operates under a council–manager form of government. The council consists of a mayor (currently, Frank Cownie) and is elected in citywide vote, two at-large members, and four members representing each of the city's four wards. In 2014, Jonathan Gano was appointed as the new Public Works Director. In 2015, Dana Wingert was appointed as Police Chief and Pam Cooksey was appointed as the new City Engineer.\n\nThe current council members include:\n\nA plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The consolidated city-county government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would have still retained its individual government but had the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, many city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.\n\nTransportation\n\nDes Moines has an extensive skywalk system within its downtown core. With over four miles of enclosed walkway, it is one of the largest of such systems in the United States. The Des Moines Skywalk System has been criticized for hurting street-level business, though a recent initiative has been made to make street-level Skywalk entrances more visible.\n\nInterstate 235 (I-235) cuts through the city, and I-35 and I-80 both pass through the Des Moines metropolitan area, as well as the city of Des Moines. On the northern side of the city of Des Moines and passing through the cities of Altoona, Clive, Johnston, Urbandale and West Des Moines, I-35 and I-80 converge into a long concurrency while I-235 takes a direct route through Des Moines, Windsor Heights, and West Des Moines before meeting up with I-35 and I-80 on the western edge of the metro. Des Moines' freeway design makes it easy for travelers. A motorist who misses an exit at the interstate \"mixmasters\" at the eastern and western edges of the metro eventually ends up at the convergence of the same interstates at the opposite side of the metro. These Interstates include I-35, I-80, and I-235. I-235, which takes the brunt of most congestion, is six lanes throughout the entire length and expands to eight and ten lanes near the downtown area. The remainder of traffic congestion in the area occurs near the East and West Mixmasters on either side of Des Moines. I-35 south of the West Mixmaster is currently being widened to six lanes all the way to the Iowa Highway 5 (Iowa 5) bypass interchanges.\n\nDue to increasing budget constraints, the city of Des Moines implemented a speeding camera program along I-235 to gain revenue through the most densely populated parts of Greater Des Moines. The East Mixmaster has also undergone a redesign with wider lanes and redesign of bridges allowing easier traffic flow in all directions along I-35, I-80, and I-235. U.S. Highway 65 (US 65) and Iowa 5 form a freeway loop, known as the \"South Belt Freeway,\" to the east and south of the city, providing a route through the southern part of the metropolitan area. US 6, US 69, Iowa 28, Iowa 141, Iowa 163, Iowa 330, and Iowa 415 are also important routes to and within the city.\n\nThere have been proposals to convert Iowa 5 and US 65, the \"South Belt Freeway,\" into what would be renamed Interstate 335, giving the Des Moines Metropolitan Area an interstate running from the northeast suburb of Altoona to the southeastern suburb of Carlisle and then connect with I-35 in the southern part of West Des Moines.\n\nDes Moines's public transit system, operated by DART (Des Moines Area Regional Transit), which was the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority until October 2006, consists entirely of buses, including regular in-city routes and express and commuter buses to outlying suburban areas.  In 2008, a light rail system was proposed for Des Moines, but, , it has yet to receive funding or popular support.\n\nBurlington Trailways, Jefferson Lines, and Megabus run long-distance, inter-city bus routes through Des Moines.\n\nAlthough Des Moines was historically a train hub, it does not currently have passenger train service. For east-west traffic it was served by The Rock Island's Corn Belt Rocket express from Omaha to the west, to Chicago in the east. The Rock Island also offered the Twin Star Rocket to Minneapolis to the north and Dallas and Houston to the south. Northward and northwest bound, there were Chicago and North Western trains to destinations including Minneapolis. The Wabash Railroad ran service to the southeast to St. Louis.\n\nThe nearest Amtrak station is Osceola, about 40 mi south of Des Moines, with no connecting Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach.  Osceola is served by the California Zephyr, running between Chicago and Emeryville, CA.  Note that while this source is suggestive, it is not : the map does not include all stations, due to the zoom (c.f. the tiny print).   There have been proposals to extend the upcoming Quad Cities Amtrak service along the Iowa Interstate Railroad main line to Des Moines proper. \n\nThe Des Moines International Airport (DSM), located on Fleur Drive in the southern part of Des Moines, offers nonstop service to destinations within the United States. Currently the only international service is cargo service, but there have been discussions about adding an international terminal.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Des Moines Public Schools district is the largest community school district in Iowa with 32,062 enrolled students as of the 2012–2013 school year. The district consists of 63 schools: 38 elementary schools, eleven middle schools, five high schools (East, Hoover, Lincoln, North, and Roosevelt), and ten special schools and programs. Small parts of the city are instead served by Carlisle Community Schools,\"[http://www.carlisle.k12.ia.us/dist_location.php Our Location].\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6FcNWXUAX?url\nhttp://www.carlisle.k12.ia.us/dist_location.php Archive]) Carlisle Community Schools.
