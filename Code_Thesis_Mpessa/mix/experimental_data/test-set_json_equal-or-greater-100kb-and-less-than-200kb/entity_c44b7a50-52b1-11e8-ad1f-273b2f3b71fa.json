He is held under the authority of Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF).\n\nZubaydah was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002 and has been in United States custody ever since, including four-and-a-half years in the secret prison network of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He was transferred among prisons in various countries as part of a United States rendition program. During his time in CIA custody, Zubaydah was extensively interrogated; he was water-boarded 83 timeshttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html?_r0 and subjected to numerous other torture techniques including forced nudity, sleep deprivation, confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, stress positions, and physical assaults. While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye. Videotapes of some of Zubaydah's interrogations are amongst those destroyed by the CIA in 2005.\n\nZubaydah and ten other \"high-value detainees\" were transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006. He and other former CIA detainees are held in Camp 7, where conditions are the most isolating. At his Combatant Status Review Tribunal in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered the Polish government to pay Zubaydah €100,000 in damages. It also awarded him €30,000 to cover his costs. Poland cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003. Zubaydah said through his US lawyer that he would be donating the full €100,000 in damages to victims of torture.https://news.yahoo.com/european-court-rejects-polish-appeal-cia-jail-case-183203445.html Joseph Margulies was a lawyer for Zubaydah.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/secrets-politics-and-torture/transcript-83/\n\nBiography and early activities \n\nAccording to his younger brother Hesham, they had eight siblings.\n\n Hesham remembers his older brother \"as a happy-go-lucky guy, and something of a womanizer.\" Born in Saudi Arabia, Zubaydah moved to the West Bank as a teenager, where he joined in Palestinian demonstrations against the Israelis.Mayer, Jane, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, 2008. p. 140[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId\n100559912 Christopher Dickey, Securing The City: Inside America's Best Counterterror Force—The NYPD], Simon & Schuster, 2009 Zubaydah is reported to have studied computer science in Pune, India prior to his travel to Afghanistan/Pakistan at the age of 20 in 1991.\n He joined the mujahideen in the Afghan civil war,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032802066.html Peter Finn and Joby Warrick, \"Detainee's Harsh Treatment Foiled No Plots\"], The Washington Post, March 29, 2009 perhaps serving under Mohamad Kamal Elzahabi.\n In 1992, Zubaydah was injured in a mortar shell blast, which left shrapnel in his head and caused severe memory loss, as well as the loss of the ability to speak for over one year.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/17/AR2007121702151_pf.html Dan Eggen and Walter Pincus, \"FBI, CIA Debate Significance of Terror Suspect: Agencies Also Disagree On Interrogation Methods\"], The Washington Post, December 18, 2007Ron Suskind, The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11, Simon & Schuster, 2006\n\nZubaydah eventually became involved in the jihad training site known as the Khalden training camp, where he oversaw the flow of recruits and obtained passports and paperwork for men transferring out of Khalden.

According to James Risen, \"It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia.\" One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: \"The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence.\"\n\nWhen Americans investigated the cards, they worked with \"a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence.\" Risen wrote, \"Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.\"\n\nA search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other. This was later incorrectly interpreted by some analysts reviewing the diary as symptoms of split personality disorder.\n\nZubaydah was turned over to the CIA.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/12/18/BL2007121800862.html Dan Froomkin, \"Bush’s Exhibit A for Torture\"], The Washington Post, December 18, 2007[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html Dana Priest, \"CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons\"], The Washington Post, November 2, 2005 Reports later alleged that he was transferred to secret CIA-operated prisons, known as black sites, in Pakistan, Thailand, Afghanistan, Poland, Northern Africa, and Diego Garcia.[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/europe/EU-GEN-Britain-Diego-Garcia.php \"Lawmakers to examine claims Indian Ocean island used in secret prison network\"], International Herald Tribune, October 19, 2007Dick Marty, [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2007/Emarty_20070608_NoEmbargo.pdf \"Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: Second report\"], Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, June 7, 2007[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id\n1375123 Brian Ross and Richard Esposito, \"EXCLUSIVE: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons\"], ABC News, December 5, 2005[http://www.globalpulse.net/archives/security/cia_shuttled_pr_000087.php \"CIA Shuffled Prisoners Out of Poland\"] , Global Pulse, December 5, 2005[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1237589,00.html Jason Burke, \"Secret World of U.S. Jails\"], The Observer, June 13, 2004[http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/FinalReprieveFASCExecutiveSummary.pdf Enforced Disappearance, Illegal Interstate Transfer, and Other Human Rights Abuses Involving the UK Overseas Territories: Executive Summary] , Reprieve Historically, renditions of prisoners to countries which commit torture have been illegal.

The memo reads:\nThis is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, \"I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Zubaydah was unimportant.

Apparently, the source of the rumor that Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself.

These claims directly conflict with the reports of the F.B.I. agents who first interrogated Zubaydah.

According to James Risen, \"It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia.\" One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: \"The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence.\"\n\nWhen Americans investigated the cards, they worked with \"a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence.\" Risen wrote, \"Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.\"\n\nA search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other.

They were held at what was informally known as \"Strawberry Fields,\" a secret camp within the complex built especially for former CIA detainees. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision, Rasul v. Bush (2004), might go against the Bush administration and require providing the prisoners with counsel and having to reveal data about them, on March 27, 2004, the CIA took the four men back into custody and transported them out of Guantanamo to one of their secret sites.\n\n At the time, the moves were all kept secret.\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross report \n\nIn February 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of \"14 high-value detainees,\" who had been held by the CIA and, after September 2006, by the military at Guantanamo. The ICRC described the twelve enhanced interrogation techniques covered in the OLC memos to the CIA: suffocation by water (which is described as \"torture\" by numerous US officials[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/18/the_dark_side_jane_mayer_on Amy Goodman, \"'The Dark Side': Jane Mayer on the Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, Interview Transcript\"], Democracy Now, July 18, 2008), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.

He said the most valuable information was gained before torture was used.

The memo reads:\nThis is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, \"I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Zubaydah was unimportant. Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information.\"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer] CNN, June 20, 2006\n\nIn his 2007 memoir, former CIA Director George Tenet writes:\nA published report in 2006 contended that Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to – and did – share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA, HarperCollins, 2007\n\nIntelligence obtained from Zubaydah and its aftereffects \n\nZubaydah's capture was touted as the biggest of the War on Terror until that of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed] CBS News, March 1, 2003 The director of the FBI stated Zubaydah's capture would help deter future attacks.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DB1E3AF937A35757C0A9649C8B63 NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks]. New York Times, April 4, 2002\n\nIn a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Zubaydah revealed useful intelligence when enhanced interrogation was used, including identification of two important suspects and information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil. These claims directly conflict with the reports of the F.B.I. agents who first interrogated Zubaydah. He gave them the names before torture was used, and the third piece of information came from other sources who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques, as well as other government officials.[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html \"Abu Zubaydah\"], New York Times, April 20, 2009\n\nIraq War (2003) \n\nThe Bush administration relied on some of Zubaydah's claims in justifying the invasion of Iraq.

He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary \"in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3\"—a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego. Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail \"what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said.\" Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, \"This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality.\" According to Suskind, this judgment was \"echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President.\" Coleman stated Zubaydah was a \"safehouse keeper\" with mental problems, who \"claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did.\"\n\nJoseph Margulies, Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an OpEd in the Los Angeles Times:\nPartly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away.
