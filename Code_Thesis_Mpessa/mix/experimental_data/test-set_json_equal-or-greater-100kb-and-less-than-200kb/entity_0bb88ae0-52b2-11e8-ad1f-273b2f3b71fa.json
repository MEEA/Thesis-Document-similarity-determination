  "textBody" : "Hadrian (; ;In Classical Latin, Hadrian's name would be inscribed as PVBLIVS AELIVS HADRIANVS AVGVSTVS.As emperor his name was Imperator Caesar Divi Traiani filius Traianus Hadrianus Augustus. 24 January 76 – 10 July 138) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138. He was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus, probably at Italica, near Santiponce (in modern-day Spain), into a Hispano-Roman family with centuries-old roots in Hispania.Alicia M. Canto, [https://www.academia.edu/1082511/It%C3%A1lica_sedes_natalis_de_Adriano._31_textos_hist%C3%B3ricos_y_argumentos_para_una_secular_pol%C3%A9mica_2004_ Itálica, sedes natalis de Adriano. 31 textos históricos y argumentos para una secular polémica], Athenaeum XCII/2, 2004, 367-408. His father was a maternal cousin of the emperor Trajan. Some years before Hadrian's accession, he married Trajan's grand-niece, Vibia Sabina. While Trajan did not officially designate an heir, his close friend and adviser Licinius Sura was well disposed towards Hadrian. Trajan's wife, Pompeia Plotina, claimed that her husband had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death.  \n\nRome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but soon after, four leading senators who had opposed Hadrian, or seemed to threaten his position, were unlawfully put to death; the senate held Hadrian responsible for this, and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and recent territorial gains in Mesopotamia, Assyria and Armenia, and parts of Dacia. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders, and the unification, under his overall leadership, of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia. Late in his reign he suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea; with this major exception, Hadrian's reign was generally peaceful.\n\nHadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests; accompanied by a probably vast Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators, he visited almost every province of the Empire. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and fostered, designed or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt or completed the Pantheon, and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria. An ardent admirer of Greece, he sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the Empire and ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with the Greek youth Antinous, and the latter's untimely death, led to Hadrian's establishment of an enduring and widespread popular cult. \n\nHadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. He saw the bar Kokhba revolt as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. His execution of two more senators for their alleged plots against him provoked further resentment. His marriage to Vibia Sabina had been unhappy, and childless; in 138 he adopted Antoninus Pius and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as his own heirs. Hadrian died the same year at Baiae, and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. Thereafter, Roman histories present Hadrian as a complex and difficult character. British historian Edward Gibbon includes him among the Empire's \"Five good emperors\", a \"benevolent dictator\"; Hadrian's own senate found him remote and authoritarian. He has been described as enigmatic and contradictory, with a capacity for both great personal generosity and extreme cruelty, and driven by insatiable curiosity, self-conceit, and above all, ambition.Ando, Clifford. “Phoenix.” Phoenix, vol. 52, no. 1/2, 1998, pp. 183–185. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1088268. Modern interest was revived largely thanks to Marguerite Yourcenar's novel Mémoires d'Hadrien (1951).\n\nEarly life\n\nHadrian was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in either Italica (near modern Seville) in the province of Hispania BaeticaAlicia M. Canto, \"Itálica, patria y ciudad natal de Adriano (31 textos históricos y argumentos contra Vita Hadr). His father died in AD 86 when Hadrian was at the age of 10. 1, 3\", Athenaeum vol.92.2, 2004, pp.367–408 [http://dobc.unipv.it/dipscant/athenaeum/athenaeum.html UNIPV.it]  or Rome,Ronald Syme, in his paper \"Hadrian and Italica\" (Journal of Roman Studies, LIV, 1964; pp.142–149) supported the position that Rome was Hadrian's birthplace. Canto, however, argues that only one extant ancient source gives Hadrian's birthplace as Rome (SHA, Vita Hadr 2,4, probably interpolated), as opposed to 25 other sources affirming that he was born in Italica. Among these alternative sources is Hadrian's own imperial horoscope, included in the surviving fragments of an astrological compendium attributed to Antigonus of Nicaea, written during the late 2nd century:cf. Stephan Heiler, \"The Emperor Hadrian in the Horoscopes of Antigonus of Nicaea\", in Günther Oestmann, H. Darrel Rutkin, Kocku von Stuckrad, eds.,Horoscopes and Public Spheres: Essays on the History of Astrology. Berlim: Walter de Gruyter, 2005, , page 49. This horoscope was well studied by prominent authors such as F.H. Cramer, Astrology in Roman Law and Politics, Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 37, Philadelphia, 1954 (repr. 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?idzv0UAAAAIAAJ&pgis\n1 see] for Hadrian pp.162–178, fn. 121b and 122, etc.: \"... Hadrian – whose horoscope is absolutely certainsurely was born in southern Spain ... (in) SHA, Hadrian, 2, 4, the birth was erroneously assigned to Rome instead of Italica, the actual birthplace of Hadrian...\", or O.Neugebauer and H.B. Van Hoesen in their magisterial compilation Greek Horoscopes, Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 48, Philadelphia, 1959, nr.L76, see now [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEgnLpm06zQC here, ed. 1987] pp.80, 90–1, and his footnote 19. They came also to the conclusion that the astronomic parallel of the Hadrian's birth is situated in the Baetica, today Andalusia: \"...L40 agrees exactly with the geographical latitude of southern Spain, the place of origin of Hadrian and his family...\".. \"since Hadrian was born in Italica (southern Spain, near Seville, latitude about 37° 30)...\". to a well-established Roman family with centuries-old roots in Italica. His biography in the Historia Augusta states that he was born in Rome on 24January 76 to an ethnically Hispanic family with vague paternal links to Italy, though this may be a complimentary fiction coined to make Hadrian appear a natural-born Roman instead of a provincial whose parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were born and raised in Hispania.Historia Augusta, 'Hadrian', I-II, here explicitly citing the autobiography. This is one of the passages in the Historia Augusta where there is no reason to suspect invention. But see now the Canto's 31 contrary arguments in the op.cit. supra; among them, in the same Historia Augusta and, from the same author, Aelius Spartianus, Vita Sev. 21: Falsus est etiam ipse Traianus in suo municipe ac nepote diligendo, see also :es:Adriano#cite note-nacimiento-0, and, characterizing him as a man of provinces (Canto, ibid.): Vita Hadr. 1,3: Quaesturam gessit Traiano quater et Articuleio consulibus, in qua cum orationem imperatoris in senatu agrestius pronuntians risus esset, usque ad summam peritiam et facundiam Latinis operam dedit It was general knowledge that Hadrian and his predecessor Trajan werein the words of Aurelius Victor\"aliens\", people \"from the outside\" (advenae).Alicia M. Canto, \"La dinastía Ulpio-Aelia (96–192 d.C.): ni tan Buenos, ni tan Adoptivos ni tan Antoninos\". Gerión (21.1): 263–305. 2003\n\nHadrian's father was Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, who as a senator of praetorian rank would have spent much of his time in Rome.On the numerous senatorial families from Spain residing at Rome and its vicinity around the time of Hadrian's birth see R. Syme, 'Spaniards at Tivoli', in Roman Papers IV (Oxford, 1988), pp.96–114. Tivoli (Tibur) was of course the site of Hadrian's own imperial villa. Hadrian's known paternal ancestry can be partly linked to a family from Hadria (modern Atri), an ancient town in Picenum, Italy. This family had settled in Italica soon after its founding by Scipio Africanus several centuries before Hadrian's birth. Hadrian's father, Afer, and his paternal cousin, the Emperor Trajan, were both born and raised in Hispania. Hadrian's mother was Domitia Paulina, daughter of a distinguished Hispano-Roman senatorial family from Gades (Cádiz).Royston Lambert, Beloved And God, pp.31–32. \n\nHadrian's elder sister and only sibling was Aelia Domitia Paulina, married to Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, who was consul three times. Hadrian also had a niece, Julia Serviana Paulina, and a great-nephew, Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator, from Barcino (Barcelona). In 86, when Hadrian was ten years old, his parents died, and he became a ward of both Trajan and Publius Acilius Attianus (who was later Trajan's Praetorian prefect). Hadrian was physically active, and enjoyed hunting; when he was 14, Trajan called him to Rome and arranged his further schooling in subjects appropriate to a young Roman aristocrat. Hadrian proved so fond of Greek literature that he was nicknamed Graeculus (\"Greekling\").\n\nPublic service\n\nHadrian's first official post in Rome was as a judge at the Inheritance court, one among many vigintivirate offices at the lowest level of the cursus honorum (\"course of honours\") that could lead to higher office and a senatorial career. He then served as a military tribune, first with the LegioII Adiutrix in 95, then with the Legio V Macedonica. During Hadrian's second stint as tribune, the frail and aged reigning emperor Nerva adopted Trajan as his heir; Hadrian was dispatched to give Trajan the news— or most probably was one of many emissaries charged with this same commission.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.37 Then he was transferred to Legio XXII Primigenia and a third tribunate.John D. Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96–99. Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, , p. 109 Hadrian's three tribunates gave him some career advantage. Most scions of the older senatorial families might serve one, or at most two military tribunates as a prerequisite to higher office.Thorsten Opper, The Emperor Hadrian. British Museum Press, 2008, p.39Jörg Fündling, Kommentar zur Vita Hadriani der Historia Augusta (= Antiquitas. Reihe 4: Beiträge zur Historia-Augusta-Forschung, Serie 3: Kommentare, Bände 4.1 und 4.2). Habelt, Bonn 2006, , p. 351. When Nerva died in 98, Hadrian is said to have hastened to Trajan, to inform him ahead of the official envoy sent by the governor, Hadrian's brother-in-law and rival Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus.John D. Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis, p. 109; Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds. The Cambridge Ancient History – XI. Cambridge U. P.: 2000, , p. 133.\n\nIn 101, Hadrian was back in Rome; he was elected quaestor, then quaestor imperatoris Traiani, liaison officer between Emperor and the assembled Senate, to whom he read the Emperor's communiqués and speeches – which he possibly composed on the emperor's behalf. In his role as imperial ghostwriter, Hadrian took the place of the recently deceased Licinius Sura, Trajan's all-powerful friend and kingmaker.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.54 His next post was as ab actis senatus, keeping the Senate's records.Boatwright, in Barrett, p. 158 During the First Dacian War, Hadrian took the field as a member of Trajan's personal entourage, but was excused from his military post to take office in Rome as Tribune of the Plebs, in 105. After the war, he was probably elected praetor.The text of Historia Augusta (Vita Hadriani, 3.8) is garbled, stating that Hadrian's election to the praetorship was contemporary \"to the second consulate of Suburanus and Servianus\" – two characters that had non-simultaneous second consulships – so Hadrian's election could be dated to 102 or 104, the later date being the most accepted During the Second Dacian War, Hadrian was in Trajan's personal service again, but was released to serve as legate of Legio I Minervia, then as governor of Lower Pannonia in 107, tasked with \"holding back the Sarmatians\".Bowman, p. 133Anthony Everitt, 2013, Chapter XI: \"holding back the Sarmatians\" may simply have meant maintaining and patrolling the border. \n\nNow in his mid-thirties, Hadrian travelled to Greece; he was granted Athenian citizenship and was appointed eponymous archon of Athens for a brief time (in 112).The inscription in footnote 1 The Athenians awarded him a statue with an inscription in the Theater of Dionysus ( IG II2 3286) offering a detailed account of his cursus honorum thus far.The Athenian inscription confirms and expands the one in Historia Augusta; see John Bodel, ed., Epigraphic Evidence: Ancient History From Inscriptions. Abingdon: Routledge, 2006, , p. 89His career in office up to 112/113 is attested by the Athens inscription, 112 AD: CIL III, 550 InscrAtt 3 \n IG II, 3286 Dessau 308 \n IDRE 2, 365: decemvir stlitibus iudicandis/ sevir turmae equitum Romanorum/ praefectus Urbi feriarum Latinarum/ tribunus militum legionis II Adiutricis Piae Fidelis (95, in Pannonia Inferior)/ tribunus militum legionis V Macedonicae (96, in Moesia Inferior)/ tribunus militum legionis XXII Primigeniae Piae Fidelis (97, in Germania Superior)/ quaestor (101)/ ab actis senatus/ tribunus plebis (105)/ praetor (106)/ legatus legionis I Minerviae Piae Fidelis (106, in Germania Inferior)/ legatus Augusti pro praetore Pannoniae Inferioris (107)/ consul suffectus (108)/ septemvir epulonum (before 112)/ sodalis Augustalis (before 112)/ archon Athenis (112/13). \n\nHe also held office as legatus Syriae (117): see H.W. Benario in [http://www.roman-emperors.org/hadrian.htm Roman-emperors.org] Thereafter no more is heard of him until Trajan's Parthian War. It is possible that he remained in Greece until his recall to the imperial retinue.\n\nHadrian joined Trajan's expedition against Parthia as a legate.Anthony Birley, Hadrian the Restless Emperor, p.68 When the governor of Syria was sent to deal with renewed troubles in Dacia, Hadrian was appointed his replacement, with independent command.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.75 Trajan became seriously ill, and took ship for Rome, while Hadrian remained in Syria, de facto general commander of the Eastern Roman army.Karl Strobel: Kaiser Traian. Eine Epoche der Weltgeschichte. Regensburg:  2010, p. 401. Trajan got as far as the coastal city of Selinus, in Cilicia; he was too ill to travel any further. He died there, on 8 August; he would be regarded as one of Rome's most admired, popular and best emperors. \n\nRelationship with Trajan and his family\n\nAround the time of his quaestorship, in 100 or 101, Hadrian had married Trajan's twelve-year-old grandniece, Vibia Sabina. The marriage might have been arranged by Trajan's empress, Plotina. This highly cultured, influential woman shared many of Hadrian's values and interests, including the idea of the Roman Empire as a commonwealth with an underlying Hellenic culture.Hidalgo de la Vega, Maria José:  \"Plotina, Sabina y Las Dos Faustinas: La Función de Las Augustas en La Politica Imperial\". Studia historica, Historia antigua, 18, 2000, pp. 191–224. Available at [http://campus.usal.es/~revistas_trabajo/index.php/0213-2052/article/viewFile/6224/6238]. Retrieved January 11, 2017 If Hadrian were to be appointed Trajan's successor, Plotina and her extended family could retain their social profile and political influence after Trajan's death.Plotina may have sought to avoid the fate of her contemporary, former empress Domitia Longina, who had fallen into social and political oblivion: see François Chausson, \"Variétés Généalogiques IV:Cohésion, Collusions, Collisions: Une Autre Dynastie Antonine\", in Giorgio Bonamente, Hartwin Brandt, eds., Historiae Augustae Colloquium Bambergense. Bari: Edipuglia, 2007, , p.143 Hadrian could also count on the support of his mother-in-law, Salonina Matidia, who was daughter of Trajan's beloved sister Ulpia Marciana.Marasco, p. 375Tracy Jennings, \"A Man Among Gods: Evaluating the Signficance of Hadrian's Acts of Deification.\" Journal of Undergraduate Research: 54.

Accessed April 15, 2017 When Ulpia Marciana died, in 112, Trajan had her deified, and made Salonina Matidia an Augusta.This made Hadrian the first senator in history to have an Augusta as his mother-in-law, something that his contemporaries could not fail to notice: see Christer Brun, \"Matidia die Jüngere\", IN Anne Kolb, ed., Augustae. Machtbewusste Frauen am römischen Kaiserhof?: Herrschaftsstrukturen und Herrschaftspraxis II. Akten der Tagung in Zürich 18.-20. 9. 2008. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010, , p.230 Trajan himself seems to have been less than enthusiastic about Sabina and Hadrian' marriage, and with good reason; the couple's relationship would prove to be scandalously poor.Robert H. Allen, The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia, Jefferson: Mcfarland, 2006, , p.120\n\nHadrian's personal relationship with Trajan was complex, and may have been difficult. Hadrian seems to have sought influence over Trajan, or Trajan's decisions, through cultivation of the latter's boy favourites; this gave rise to some unexplained quarrel, around the time of Hadrian's marriage to Sabina.Thorsten Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict. Harvard University Press, 2008, p.170David L. Balch, Carolyn Osiek, eds., Early Christian Families in Context: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003, , p.301 Late in Trajan's reign, Hadrian failed to achieve a senior consulship, being only suffect consul for 108;Anthony R Birley, Hadrian: The Restless Emperor, p.54 this gave him parity of status with other members of the senatorial nobility;Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds., The Cambridge Ancient History, XI, p. 133but no particular distinction befitting an heir designate.Mackay, Christopher. Ancient Rome: a Military and Political History. Cambridge U. Press: 2007, , p.229 Had Trajan wished it, he could have promoted his protege to patrician rank and its privileges, which included opportunities for a fast track to consulship without prior experience as tribune; but he chose not to.Fündling, 335 Hadrian was made Tribune of the Plebs somewhat younger than was customary, and was promoted to praetorian rank; but he was consistently excluded from Trajan's innermost circle of advisers.Gabriele Marasco, ed., Political Autobiographies and Memoirs in Antiquity: A Brill Companion. Leiden: Brill, 2011, , p.375 The Historia Augusta describes Trajan's gift to Hadrian of a diamond ring that Trajan himself had received from Nerva, which \"encouraged [Hadrian's] hopes of succeeding to the throne\".Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 3.7In 23 BC Augustus handed a similar ring to his heir apparent, Agrippa: see Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante, eds., The World of Roman Costume. University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 78 While Trajan actively promoted Hadrian's advancement, he did so with caution.Fündling, 351\n\nSuccession\n\nFailure to nominate an heir could invite chaotic, destructive wresting of power by a succession of competing claimants - a civil war. Too early a nomination could be seen as an abdication, and reduce the chance for an orderly transmission of power.Fündling, 384; Strobel, 401. As Trajan lay dying, nursed by his wife, Plotina, and closely watched by Prefect Attianus, he could have lawfully adopted Hadrian as heir, by means of a simple deathbed wish, expressed before witnesses;John Richardson, \"The Roman Mind and the power of fiction\" IN Lewis Ayres, Ian Gray Kidd, eds. The Passionate Intellect: Essays on the Transformation of Classical Traditions : Presented to Professor I.G. Kidd. New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1995, , p. 128 but when an adoption document was eventually presented, it was signed not by Trajan but by Plotina, and was dated the day after Trajan's death.Elizabeth Speller, p. 25 That Hadrian was still in Syria was a further irregularity, as Roman adoption law required the presence of both parties at the adoption ceremony. Rumours, doubts, and speculation attended Hadrian's adoption and succession. It has been suggested that Trajan's young manservant Phaedimus, who died very soon after Trajan, was killed (or killed himself) rather than face awkward questions.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 80 Ancient sources are divided on the legitimacy of Hadrian's adoption: Dio Cassius saw it as bogus and the Historia Augusta writer as genuine.Stephan Brassloff, \"Die Rechtsfrage bei der Adoption Hadrians\". Hermes 49. Bd., H. 4 (Sep., 1914), pp. 590–601 An aureus minted early in Hadrian's reign represents the official position; it presents Hadrian as a \"Caesar\" (meaning an heir designate).The coin legend runs HADRIANO TRAIANO CAESARI; see Roman, Yves, Rémy, Bernard & Riccardi, Laurent:\" Les intrigues de Plotine et la succession de Trajan. À propos d'un aureus au nom d'Hadrien César\". Révue des études anciennes, T. 111, 2009, no. 2, pp. 508-517\n\nEmperor (117)\n\nSecuring power\n\nAccording to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian informed the Senate of his accession in a letter as a fait accompli, explaining that \"the unseemly haste of the troops in acclaiming him emperor was due to the belief that the state could not be without an emperor\".Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 6.2 The new emperor rewarded the legions' loyalty with the customary bonus, and the Senate endorsed the acclamation. Various public ceremonies were organized on Hadrian's behalf, celebrating his \"divine election\" by all the gods, whose community now included Trajan, deified at Hadrian's request.Egyptian papyri tell of one such ceremony betwee n 117 and 118; see Michael Peppard, The Son of God in the Roman World: Divine Sonship in Its Social and Political Context. Oxford U. Press, 2011, , pp. 72f \n\nHadrian remained in the east for a while, suppressing the Jewish revolt that had broken out under Trajan. He relieved Judea's governor, the outstanding Moorish general Lusius Quietus, of his personal guard of Moorish auxiliaries;Royston Lambert, p. 34Cizek, Eugen.

In Rome, Attianus, Hadrian's former guardian, took charge as Praetorian Prefect. He claimed to have uncovered a conspiracy involving four leading senators, who included Lusius Quietus.Elizabeth Speller. There was no public trial for the four – they were tried in absentia, hunted down and killed. Hadrian claimed that Attianus had acted on his own initiative, and rewarded him with senatorial status and consular rank; then pensioned him off, no later than 120.It is likely that Hadrian found Attianus' ambition suspect. Attianus was likely dead, or executed, by the end of Hadrian's reign; see Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?: ascension des élites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste à Hadrien, 27 av. J.-C.-138 ap. J.-C. Madrid: Casa de Velázquez, 2005, , p. 611 Hadrian assured the senate that henceforth their ancient right to prosecute and judge their own would be respected. \n\nThe reasons for these four executions remain obscure. Official recognition of Hadrian as legitimate heir may have come too late to dissuade other potential claimants.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, 55 Hadrian's greatest rivals were Trajan's closest friends, the most experienced and senior members of the imperial council;John Antony Crook, Consilium Principis: Imperial Councils and Counsellors from Augustus to Diocletian. Cambridge University Press: 1955, pp. 54f any of them might have been a legitimate competitor for the imperial office (capaces imperii);Marasco, p. 377 and any of them might have supported Trajan's expansionist policies, which Hadrian intended to change.M. Christol & D. Nony, Rome et son Empire. Paris: Hachette, 2003, , p. 158 One of their number was Aulus Cornelius Palma who as a former conqueror of Arabia Nabatea would have retained a stake in the East.Hadrien Bru, Le pouvoir impérial dans les provinces syriennes: Représentations et célébrations d'Auguste à Constantin. Leiden: Brill, 2011, , pp. 46f The Historia Augusta describes Palma and a third executed senator, Lucius Publilius Celsus (consul for the second time in 113), as Hadrian's personal enemies, who had spoken in public against him.Carcopino Jérôme. \"L'hérédité dynastique chez les Antonins\". Revue des Études Anciennes. Tome 51, 1949, no.3–4. pp. 262–321. The fourth was Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, an ex-consul, intellectual, friend of Pliny the Younger and (briefly) Governor of Dacia at the start of Hadrian's reign. He was probably Hadrian's chief rival for the throne; a senator of highest rank, breeding, and connections; according to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian had considered making Nigrinus his heir apparent, before deciding to get rid of him.Cizek, \"L'éloge de Caius Avidius Nigrinus\"Nigrinus' ambiguous relationship with Hadrian would have consequences late in Hadrian's reign, when he had to plan his own succession; see Anthony Everitt, Hadrian and the triumph of Rome. New York: Random House, 2009, .\n\nSoon after, in 125, Hadrian appointed Marcius Turbo as his Praetorian Prefect.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 91 Turbo was his close friend, a leading figure of the equestrian order, a senior court judge and aprocurator.Christol & Nony, p. 158Richard P. Saller, Personal Patronage Under the Early Empire. Cambridge Un iversity Press: 2002, , p. 140 As Hadrian also forbade equestrians to try cases against senators,Richard A. Bauman, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Rome. London: Routledge, 2002, , p. 83 the Senate retained full legal authority over its members; it also remained the highest court of appeal, and formal appeals to the emperor regarding its decisions were forbidden.Digest, 49 2, I,2, quoted by P.E. Corbett, \"The Legislation of Hadrian\". University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register,  Vol. 74, No. 8 (Jun., 1926), pp. 753–766 If this was an attempt to repair the damage done by Attianus, with or without Hadrian's full knowledge, it was not enough; Hadrian's reputation and relationship with his Senate were iredeemably soured, for the rest of his reign.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 88 Some sources describe Hadrian's occasional recourse to a network of informers, the frumentariiChristopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order. Oxford University Press, 2012, , p. 153 to discretely investigate persons of high social standing, including senators and his close friends.Rose Mary Sheldon, Intelligence Activities in Ancient Rome: Trust in the Gods But Verify. London: Routledge, 2004, , p. 253\n\nTravels\n\nHadrian was to spend more than half his reign outside Italy. Whereas previous emperors had, for the most part, relied on the reports of their imperial representatives around the Empire, Hadrian wished to see things for himself. Previous emperors had often left Rome for long periods, but mostly to go to war, returning once the conflict was settled. Hadrian's near-incessant travels may represent a calculated break with traditions and attitudes in which the empire was a purely Roman hegemony. Hadrian sought to include provincials in a commonwealth of civilized peoples and a common Hellenic culture under Roman supervision.Paul Veyne, Le Pain et le Cirque, Paris: Seuil, 1976, , p. 655 He supported the creation of provincial towns (municipia), semi-autonomous urban communities with their own customs and laws, rather than the imposition of new Roman colonies with Roman constitutions.András Mócsy, Pannonia and Upper Moesia (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire, Routledge, 2014 \n\nThe cosmopolitan, ecumenical intent of Hadrian's travels is evident in coin issues of his later reign, showing the emperor \"raising up\" the personifications of various provinces.Paul Veyne, \" Humanitas: Romans and non-Romans\". In Andrea Giardina, ed., The Romans, University of Chicago Press: 1993, , p. 364 The Greek rhetorician Aelius Aristides later wrote that Hadrian \"extended over his subjects a protecting hand, raising them as one helps fallen men on their feet\".Christol & Nony, p. 159. All this did not go well with Roman traditionalists. The self-indulgent emperor Nero had enjoyed a prolonged and peaceful tour of Greece, and had been criticised by the Roman elite for abandoning his fundamental responsibilities as emperor. In the eastern provinces, and to some extent in the west, Nero had enjoyed popular support; claims of his imminent return or rebirth emerged almost immediately after his death.

Fronto writes about military losses in Britannia at the time.Opper, p. 79 Coin legends of 119-120 attest that Pompeius Falco was sent to restore order. In 122 Hadrian initiated the construction of a wall, \"to separate Romans from barbarians\".Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Hadrian, xi, 2 This deterred attacks on Roman territory at a lower cost than a massed border army,Patrick le Roux, Le haut-Empire romain en Occident d'Auguste aux Sévères.

By the end of 122, Hadrian had concluded his visit to Britannia. He never saw the finished wall that bears his name.\n\nHadrian appears to have continued through southern Gaul. At Nemausus, he may have overseen the building of a basilica dedicated to his patroness Plotina, who had recently died in Rome and had been deified at Hadrian's request.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 145 At around this time, Hadrian dismissed his secretary ab epistulis, the historian Suetonius, for \"excessive familiarity\" towards the empress.Jason König, Katerina Oikonomopoulou, Greg Woolf, eds. Ancient Libraries. Cambridge U. Press: 2013, , page 251 Marcius Turbo's colleague as Praetorian Prefect, Gaius Septicius Clarus was dismissed for the same alleged reason, perhaps a pretext to remove him from office.Anthony Everitt, Hadrian and the triumph of Rome. Hadrian spent the winter of 122/123 at Tarraco, in Spain, where he restored the Temple of Augustus.William E. Mierse, Temples and Towns in Roman Iberia: The Social and Architectural Dynamics of Sanctuary Designs from the Third Century B.C. to the Third Century A.D.. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, , page 141\n\nAfrica, Parthia and Anatolia; Antinous (123–124)\n\nIn 123, Hadrian crossed the Mediterranean to Mauretania, where he personally led a minor campaign against local rebels.Royston Lambert, pp. 41–2 The visit was cut short by reports of war preparations by Parthia; Hadrian quickly headed eastwards. At some point, he visited Cyrene, where he personally funded the training of young men from well-bred families for the Roman military. Cyrene had benefited earlier (in 119) from his restoration of public buildings destroyed during the earlier Jewish revolt.Anthony Birley, pp. 151–2The rebuilding continued until late in Hadrian's reign; in 138 a statue of Zeus was erected there, dedicated to Hadrian as Cyrene's \"saviour and founder\". See E. Mary Smallwood, The Jews Under Roman Rule from Pompey to Diocletian : a Study in Political Relations. Leiden, Brill, 2001, 0-391-04155-X, p. 410\n\nWhen Hadrian arrived on the Euphrates, he personally negotiated a settlement with the Parthian King Osroes I, inspected the Roman defences, then set off westwards, along the Black Sea coast.Anthony Birley, pp. 153–5 He probably wintered in Nicomedia, the main city of Bithynia. Nicomedia had been hit by an earthquake only shortly before his stay; Hadrian provided funds for its rebuilding, and was acclaimed as restorer of the province.Anthony Birley, pp. 157–8\n\nIt is possible that Hadrian visited Claudiopolis and saw the beautiful Antinous, a young man of humble birth who became Hadrian's beloved. Literary and epigraphic sources say nothing on when or where they met; depictions of Antinous show him aged 20 or so, shortly before his death in 130. In 123 he would most likely have been a youth of 13 or 14. It is also possible that Antinous was sent to Rome to be trained as a page to serve the emperor and only gradually rose to the status of imperial favourite.Royston Lambert, pp. 60–1 The actual history of their relationship is mostly unknown.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 171\n\nWith or without Antinous, Hadrian travelled through Anatolia. His route is unknown. Various traditions suggest his presence at particular locations; he is said to have founded a city within Mysia, Hadrianutherae, after a successful boar hunt, but this is debated. At about this time, plans to complete the Temple of Zeus in Cyzicus, begun by the kings of Pergamon, were put into practice. The temple received a colossal statue of Hadrian, and Cyzicus was made a regional centre for the Imperial cult (neocoros), sharing it with Pergamon, Smyrna, Ephesus and SardesAnthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 164–7 – something that offered the benefits of Imperial sponsorship of sacred games, attracting tourism, and stimulating private expenditure, as well as channelling intercity rivalry into a common acceptance of Roman rule.Boatwright, p. 136\n\nGreece (124–125)\n\nHadrian arrived in Greece during the autumn of 124, and participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries. He had a particular commitment to Athens, which had previously granted him citizenship and an archonate; at the Athenians' request, he revised their constitution – among other things, he added a new phyle (tribe), which was named after him.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 175–7 Hadrian combined active, hands-on interventions with cautious restraint. He refused to intervene in a local dispute between producers of olive oil and the Athenian Assembly and Council, who had imposed production quotas on oil producers;Kaja Harter-Uibopuu, \"Hadrian and the Athenian Oil Law\", in O.M.

Retrieved June 20, 2015 Generally Hadrian preferred that Greek notables, including priests of the Imperial cult, focus on more durable provisions, such as aqueducts and public fountains (nymphaea).Mark Golden, Greek Sport and Social Status, University of Texas Press, 2009, , p. 88 Athens was given two such fountains; another was given to Argos.Cynthia Kosso, Anne Scott, eds., The Nature and Function of Water, Baths, Bathing, and Hygiene from Antiquity Through the Renaissance. Leiden: Brill, 2009, , pp. 216f\n\nDuring the winter he toured the Peloponnese.

OUP : 2010, , p. 171 in thanks to their \"restorer\". He was especially generous to Mantinea, where he restored the Temple of Poseidon Hippios; this supports the theory that Antinous was in fact already Hadrian's lover because of the strong link between Mantinea and Antinous's home in Bithynia.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 177–80 As this kinship between Mantinea and Bythinia was itself a mythological fiction of the kind used at the time for encouraging political alliances between polities, a more serious reason might exist for Hadrian's particular generosity.David S. Potter,The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180–395. London: Routledge, 2014, , p. 44 Hadrian's building programme favoured long-established religious centers. Besides the temple at Mantinea, Hadrian restored other ancient shrines in Abae, Argos – where he restored the Heraion – and Megara.Boatwright, p. 134 This was a way of gathering legitimacy to Roman imperial rule by associating it with the glories of classical Greece – something well in line with contemporary antiquarian taste in cultural matters.K. W. Arafat, Pausanias' Greece: Ancient Artists and Roman Rulers. Cambridge U. Press, 2004, , p. 162 Pausanias credits Hadrian with restoring to Mantinea its ancient, classical name. It had been named Antigoneia since Hellenistic times, in honour of the Macedonian King Antigonus III Doson.K. W. Arafat, p. 185\n \nDuring his tour of the Peloponnese, Hadrian persuaded the Spartan grandee Eurycles Herculanus – leader of the Euryclid family that had ruled Sparta since Augustus' day – to enter the Senate, alongside the Athenian grandee Herodes Atticus the Elder. The two aristocrats would be the first from \"Old Greece\" to enter the Roman Senate, as representatives of the two \"great powers\" of the Classical Age.Birley, [http://uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/116pdf/116209.pdf \"Hadrian and Greek Senators\"], Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 116 (1997), pp. 209–245. Retrieved July 23, 2015 This was an important step in overcoming Greek notables' reluctance to take part in Roman political life.Christol & Nony, p. 203 In March 125, Hadrian presided at the Athenian festival of Dionysia, wearing Athenian dress. He initiated a substantial public building program in and around Athens. The Temple of Olympian Zeus had been under construction for more than five centuries; Hadrian committed the vast resources at his command to ensure that the job would be finished. He also organised the planning and construction of a particularly challenging and ambitious aqueduct to bring water to the Athenian agora.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 182–4\n\nReturn to Italy and trip to Africa (126–128)\n\nOn his return to Italy, Hadrian made a detour to Sicily. Coins celebrate him as the restorer of the island.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 191–200 Back in Rome, he saw the rebuilt Pantheon, and his completed villa at nearby Tibur, among the Sabine Hills. In early March 127 Hadrian set off on a tour of Italy; his route has been reconstructed through the evidence of his gifts and donations. He restored the shrine of Cupra in Cupra Maritima, and improved the drainage of the Fucine lake. Less welcome than such largesse was his decision in 127 to divide Italy into four regions under imperial legates with consular rank, acting as governors. They were given jurisdiction over all of Italy, excluding Rome itself, therefore shifting cases from the courts of Rome.J. Declareuil, Rome the Law-Giver, London: Routledge, 2013, , p. 72 Having Italy effectively reduced to the status of a group of mere provinces did not go down well with the Roman Senate;Clifford Ando, Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000,  and the innovation did not long outlive Hadrian's reign.\n\nHadrian fell ill around this time; whatever the nature of his illness, it did not stop him from setting off in the spring of 128 to visit Africa. His arrival began with the good omen of rain ending a drought. Along with his usual role as benefactor and restorer, he found time to inspect the troops; his speech to them survives.Royston Lambert, pp. 71–2 Hadrian returned to Italy in the summer of 128 but his stay was brief, as he set off on another tour that would last three years.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 213–4\n\nGreece, Asia, and Egypt (128–130); Antinous's death\n\nIn September 128, Hadrian attended the Eleusinian mysteries again. This time his visit to Greece seems to have concentrated on Athens and Sparta – the two ancient rivals for dominance of Greece. Hadrian had played with the idea of focusing his Greek revival around the Amphictyonic League based in Delphi, but by now he had decided on something far grander. His new Panhellenion was going to be a council that would bring Greek cities together. Having set in motion the preparations – deciding whose claim to be a Greek city was genuine would take time – Hadrian set off for Ephesus.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 215–20 From Greece, Hadrian proceeded by way of Asia to Egypt. It is known from an inscription that he was probably conveyed across the Aegean with his entourage by an Ephesian merchant, Lucius Erastus. Hadrian later sent a letter on Erastus' behalf to the Council of Ephesus, supporting his request to become a town councillor. Hadrian offered to pay the requisite fee for Erastus' council membership, as long as the Ephesians considered him worthy (as a merchant, he may well have been thought unworthy).Boatwright, p. 81\n\nIn Egypt, Hadrian opened his stay by restoring Pompey the Great's tomb at Pelusium.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 235 Hadrian also offered sacrifice to Pompey as a hero and composed an epigraph for the tomb. As Pompey was universally acknowledged as the conqueror of the Roman East, this restoration was probably linked to a need to reaffirm Roman Eastern hegemony after the recent disturbances there during Trajan's late reign.Boatwright, p. 142 Also in Egypt, a poem about a lion hunt in the Libyan desert by the Greek Pankrates witnesses for the first time that Antinous travelled alongside Hadrian.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 173\n\nIn October 130, while Hadrian and his entourage were sailing on the Nile, Antinous drowned. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are unknown, and accident, suicide, murder and religious sacrifice have all been postulated. Historia Augusta offers the following account:\n\nHadrian had Antinous deified as Osiris-Antinous by an Egyptian priest at the ancient Temple of Ramesses II, very near the place of his death. Hadrian dedicated a new temple-city complex there, built in a Graeco-Roman style, and named it Antinopolis.Cassius Dio, LIX.11; Historia Augusta, Hadrian It was a proper Greek polis; it was granted an Imperially subsidised alimentary scheme similar to Trajan's alimenta,Tim Cornell, Dr Kathryn Lomas, eds., Bread and Circuses: Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy. London: Routledge, 2003, , p. 97 and its citizens were allowed intermarriage with members of the native population, without loss of citizen-status. Hadrian thus identified an existing native cult (to Osiris) with Roman rule.Carl F. Petry, ed. The Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, 2008, , p. 15\n\nGreece and the East (130–132) \n\nHadrian's movements after the founding of Antinopolis on 30 October 130 are uncertain. Whether or not he returned to Rome, he travelled in the East during 130/131, to organise and inaugurate his new Panhellenion, which was to be focussed on the Athenian Temple to Olympian Zeus. Successful applications for membership involved mythologised or fabricated claims to Greek origins, and affirmations of loyalty to Imperial Rome, to satisfy Hadrian's personal, idealised notions of Hellenism.Boatwright, p. 150Anthony Kaldellis, Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical TraditionCambridge U. Press, 2008, , p. 38 Hadrian saw himself as protector of Greek culture and the \"liberties\" of Greece – in this case, urban self-government. It allowed Hadrian to appear as the fictive heir to Pericles, who supposedly had convened a previous Panhellenic Congress – such a Congress is mentioned only in Pericles' biography by Plutarch, whose sympathies to the Imperial order are well-known.Fernando A. Marín Valdés, Plutarco y el arte de la Atenas hegemónica. Universidad de Oviedo: 2008, , p. 76\n\nEpigraphical evidence suggests that the prospect of applying to the Panhellenion held little attraction to the wealthier, Hellenised cities of Asia Minor, which were jealous of Athenian and European Greek preeminence within Hadrian's scheme.A. J. S. Spawforth, Greece and the Augustan Cultural Revolution. Cambridge University Press: 2011, , p. 262 Hadrian's notion of Hellenism was narrow and deliberately archaising; he defined \"Greekness\" in terms of classical roots, rather than a broader, Hellenistic culture.Nathanael J. Andrade, Syrian Identity in the Greco-Roman World. Cambridge University Press, 2013, , p. 176 The German sociologist Georg Simmel remarked that the Panhellenion was based on \"games, commemorations, preservation of an ideal, an entirely non-political Hellenism\".Georg Simmel, Sociology: Inquiries into the Construction of Social Forms. Leiden: Brill, 2009, , p. 288\n\nThis third and last trip to the Greek East produced much religious enthusiasm in the region centred around Hadrian, who received a personal cult as a deity and many monuments and civic homages, according to the religious syncretism at the time.Marcel Le Glay. \"Hadrien et l'Asklépieion de Pergame\".

He may have planned to rebuild Jerusalem as a Roman colony – as Vespasian had done with Caesarea Maritima – with various honorific and fiscal privileges. The non-Roman population would have no obligation to participate in Roman religious rituals, but were expected to support the Roman imperial order; this is attested in Caesarea, where some Jews served in the Roman army during both the 66 and 132 rebellions.Giovanni Battista Bazzana, \"The Bar Kokhba Revolt and Hadrian's religious policy\", IN Marco Rizzi, ed.,  Hadrian and the Christians. Berlim: De Gruyter, 2010, , pages 89/91 It has been speculated that Hadrian intended to assimilate the Jewish Temple to the traditional Roman civic-religious Imperial cult; such assimilations had long been commonplace practise in Greece and in other provinces, and on the whole, had been successful.Bazzana, 98Cf a project devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo: see Rizzi, Hadrian and the Christians, 4 The neighbouring Samaritans had already integrated their religious rites with Hellenistic ones.Emmanuel Friedheim, \"Some notes about the Samaritans and the Rabbinic Class at Crossroads\" IN Menachem Mor, Friedrich V.

Ancient Rome a Military and Political History: 230 The scholar Peter Schäfer maintains that there is no evidence for this claim, given the notoriously problematical nature of the Historia Augusta as a source, the \"tomfoolery\" shown by the writer in the relevant passage, and the fact that contemporary Roman legislation on \"genital mutilation\" seems to address the general issue of castration of slaves by their masters.Peter Schäfer, The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered: New Perspectives on the Second Jewish Revolt Against Rome  Mohr Siebeck, 2003 p. 68Peter Schäfer, The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World: The Jews of Palestine from Alexander the Great to the Arab Conquest.

Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press,2014, , pp. 25–26 \n\nThe Romans were overwhelmed by the organised ferocity of the uprising.Peter Schäfer,  Der Bar Kokhba-Aufstand, Tübingen 1981, pp. 29–50 Hadrian called his general Sextus Julius Severus from Britain, and brought troops in from as far as the Danube. Roman losses were heavy; an entire legion or its numeric equivalent of around 4,000.Possibly the XXII Deiotariana, which according to epigraphy did not outlast Hadrian's reign; see [http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/xxii_deiotariana.html livius.org account; however, Peter Schäfer, following Bowersock, finds no traces in the written sources of the purported annihilation of Legio XXII. A loss of such magnitude would have surely been mentioned (Der Bar Kokhba-Aufstand, 14). Hadrian's report on the war to the Roman Senate omitted the customary salutation, \"If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the legions are in health.\"Cassius Dio 69, 14.3 The rebellion was quashed by 135. According to Cassius Dio, Roman war operations in Judea left some 580,000 Jews dead, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed. An unknown proportion of the population was enslaved. Beitar, a fortified city 10 km southwest of Jerusalem, fell after a three and a half year siege. The extent of punitive measures against the Jewish population remains a matter of debate.Daniel R.

He renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina after himself and Jupiter Capitolinus, and had it rebuilt in Greek style. According to Epiphanius, Hadrian appointed Aquila from Sinope in Pontus as \"overseer of the work of building the city\", since he was related to him by marriage.Epiphanius, Treatise on Weights and Measures – Syriac Version (ed.

In 134, he took an Imperial salutation for the end of the Second Jewish War (which was not actually concluded until the following year).

In 136, he dedicated a new Temple of Venus and Roma on the former site of Nero's Golden House. The temple was the largest in Rome, and was built in an Hellenising style, more Greek than Roman. The temple's dedication and statuary associated the worship of the traditional Roman goddess Venus, divine ancestress and protector of the Roman people, with the worship of the goddess Roma – herself a Greek invention, hitherto worshiped only in the provinces – to emphasise the universal nature of the empire.Mellor, R., \"The Goddess Roma\" in Haase, W., Temporini, H., (eds), Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt, de Gruyter, 1991, , pp. 960-964\n\nThe Empress Sabina died probably in 136, after an unhappy marriage with which Hadrian had coped as a political necessity. The Historia Augusta biography states that Hadrian himself declared that his wife's \"ill-temper and irritability\" would be reason enough for a divorce, were he a private citizen.Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 10.3 That gave credence, after Sabina's death, to the common belief that Hadrian had her poisoned.Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 23.9 As befitted Hadrian's dynastic legitimacy, Sabina – who had been made an Augusta sometime around 128Anne Kolb, Augustae.

In 136 he adopted one of the ordinary consuls of that year, Lucius Ceionius Commodus, who as an emperor-in waiting took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar. He was the son-in-law of Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, one of the \"four consulars\" executed in 118, but was himself in delicate health, apparently with a reputation more \"of a voluptuous, well educated great lord than that of a leader\".Merlin Alfred.

Hadrian would likely have shown some favor to the grandson in order to count on the grandfather's support; for an account of the various familial and marital alliances involved, see Des Boscs-Plateaux, pp. 241, 311, 477, 577; see also Frank McLynn,Marcus Aurelius: A Life. New York: Da Capo, 2010, , p. 84 It may not have been Hadrian, but rather Antoninus Pius – Annius Verus's uncle – who supported Annius Verus' advancement; the latter's divorce of Ceionia Fabia and subsequent marriage to Antoninus' daughter Annia Faustina points in the same direction. When he eventually became Emperor, Marcus Aurelius would co-opt Ceionius Commodus as his co-Emperor, under the name of Lucius Verus, on his own initiative. \n\nHadrian's last few years were marked by conflict and unhappiness. His adoption of Aelius Caesar proved unpopular, not least with Hadrian's brother-in-law Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus and Servianus's grandson Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator. Servianus, though now far too old, had stood in the line of succession at the beginning of Hadrian's reign; Fuscus is said to have had designs on the imperial power for himself. In 137 he may have attempted a coup in which his grandfather was implicated; Hadrian ordered that both be put to death.Anthony Birley, pp. 291–2 Servianus is reported to have prayed before his execution that Hadrian would \"long for death but be unable to die\".Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#17.2 69.17.2] During his final, protracted illness, Hadrian was prevented from suicide on several occasions.Anthony Birley, p. 297\n\nDeath\n\nHadrian died in the year 138 on the 10th of July, in his villa at Baiae at the age of 62. The cause of death is believed to have been heart failure. Dio Cassius and the Historia Augusta record details of his failing health. He had reigned for 21 years, the longest since Tiberius, and the fourth longest in the Principate, after Augustus, Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius, and Tiberius.\n\nHe was buried first at Puteoli, near Baiae, on an estate that had once belonged to Cicero. Soon after, his remains were transferred to Rome and buried in the Gardens of Domitia, close by the almost-complete mausoleum. Upon completion of the Tomb of Hadrian in Rome in 139 by his successor Antoninus Pius, his body was cremated, and his ashes were placed there together with those of his wife Vibia Sabina and his first adopted son, Lucius Aelius, who also died in 138. After threatening the Senate – which toyed with refusing Hadrian's divine honours – by refusing to assume power himself,Salmon, 816 Antoninus eventually succeeded in having his predecessor deifiedDio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/70*.html#1.1 70.1.1] in 139 and given a temple on the Campus Martius, ornamented with reliefs representing the provinces.Samuel Ball Platner, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome. Cambridge University Press: 2015, , page 250 The Senate awarded Antoninus the title of \"Pius\", in recognition of his filial piety in pressing for the deification of his adoptive father. At the same time, perhaps in reflection of the senate's ill will towards Hadrian, commemorative coinage honouring his consecration was kept to a minimum.Christian Bechtold, Gott und Gestirn als Präsenzformen des toten Kaisers: Apotheose und Katasterismos in der politischen Kommunikation der römischen Kaiserzeit und ihre Anknüpfungspunkte im Hellenismus.V&R unipress GmbH: 2011, , p. 259\n\nMilitary\n\nMost of Hadrian's military activities were consistent with his ideology of Empire as a community of mutual interest and support. He focussed on protection from external and internal threats; on \"raising up\" existing provinces, rather than the aggressive acquisition of wealth and territory through subjugation of \"foreign\" peoples that had characterised the early Empire.Clifford Ando, Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000, , p. 330 While the empire as a whole benefited from this, military careerists resented the loss of opportunities.   \n\nHadrian sought to surround the empire with stable, sustainable borders, and employed a variety of means to deal with potential and actual threats to the Empire's integrity. The 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor charged him with jealous belittlement of Trajan's achievements (Traiani gloriae invidens), abandoning the latter's conquests in Mesopotamia.W. Den Boer, Some Minor Roman Historians, Leiden: Brill, 1972, , p. 41 More likely, an expansionist policy was no longer realistic; the Empire had lost two legions, the Legio XXII Deiotariana and the \"lost legion\" IX Hispania, possibly destroyed in a late Trajanic uprising by the Brigantes in Britain.Yann Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army. London: Routledge, 2013, , p. 55 Trajan himself may have thought his gains in Mesopotamian indefensible, and abandoned them shortly before his death.Albino Garzetti, From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192. London: Routledge, 2014, , p. 381. Hadrian granted parts of Dacia to the Roxolani Sarmatians; their king Rasparaganus received Roman citizenship, client king status, and possibly an increased subsidy.This partial withdrawal was probably supervised by the governor of Moesia Quintus Pompeius Falco; see Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 84 & 86. Hadrian's presence on the Dacian front at this time is mere conjecture; but Dacia was included in his coin series with allegories of the provinces.Eutropius' notion that Hadrian contemplated withdrawing from Dacia altogether appears to be unfounded; see Jocelyn M. C. Toynbee, The Hadrianic School: A Chapter in the History of Greek Art. CUP Archive, 1934, 79 A controlled, partial withdrawal from the Dacian plains would have been less costly than maintaining several Roman cavalry units and a supporting network of fortifications.Julian Bennett, Trajan-Optimus Priceps. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001, , p. 165\n\nHadrian retained control over Osroene through the client king Parthamaspates, who had once served as Trajan's client king of Parthia;Opper, Empire and Conflict, p. 67 and around 121, Hadrian negotiated a peace treaty with the now-independent Parthia. Late in his reign (135), the Alani attacked Roman Cappadocia with the covert support of Pharasmanes, king of Caucasian Iberia. The attack was repulsed by Hadrian's governor, the historian Arrian,N. J. E. Austin & N. B. Rankov, Exploratio: Military & Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 4 who subsequently installed a Roman \"adviser\" in Iberia.Austin & Rankov, p. 30 Arrian kept Hadrian well-informed On all questions related to the Black Sea and the Caucasus. Between 131 and 132 he sent Hadrian a lengthy letter (Periplus of the Euxine) on a maritime trip around the Black Sea, intended to offer relevant information in case a Roman intervention was needed.Fergus Millar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East: Volume 2: Government, Society, and Culture in the Roman Empire. The University of North Carolina Press, 2005, , p. 183\n\nHadrian also developed permanent fortifications and military posts along the empire's borders (limites, sl. limes) to support his policy of stability, peace and preparedness. This helped keep the military usefully occupied in times of peace; his Wall across Britania was built by ordinary troops. A series of mostly wooden fortifications, forts, outposts and watchtowers strengthened the Danube and Rhine borders. Troops practised intensive, regular drill routines. Although his coins showed military images almost as often as peaceful ones, Hadrian's policy was peace through strength, even threat,Elizabeth Speller, p. 69 with an emphasis on disciplina (discipline), which was the subject of two monetary series. Cassius Dio praised Hadrian's emphasis on \"spit and polish\" as cause for the generally peaceful character of his reign.Opper, p. 85 Fronto expressed other opinions on the subject. In his view, Hadrian preferred war games  to actual war, and enjoyed \"giving eloquent speeches to the armies\" – like the inscribed series of addresses he made while on an inspection tour, during 128, at the new headquarters of Legio III Augusta in LambaesisBirley, Restless Emperor, pp. 209-212\n\nFaced with a shortage of legionary recruits from Italy and other Romanised provinces, Hadrian systematised the use of less costly numeri – ethnic non-citizen troops with special weapons, such as Eastern mounted archers – in low-intensity, mobile defensive tasks such as dealing with border infiltrators and skirmishers.Luttvak, Edward N. The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979, , p. 123Christol & Nony, p. 180 Hadrian is also credited with introducing units of heavy cavalry (cataphracts) into the Roman army. Fronto later blamed Hadrian for declining standards in the Roman army of his own time.Fronto: Selected Letters. Edited by Caillan Davenport & Jenifer Manley, London: AC & Black, 2014, , pp. 184f\n\nLegal and social\n\nHadrian enacted, through the jurist Salvius Julianus, the first attempt to codify Roman law. This was the Perpetual Edict, according to which the legal actions of praetors became fixed statutes, and as such could no longer be subjected to personal interpretation or change by any magistrate other than the Emperor.Laura Jansen, The Roman Paratext: Frame, Texts, Readers, Cambridge University Press, 2014,  p. 66Kathleen Kuiper (Editor), Ancient Rome: From Romulus and Remus to the Visigoth Invasion, New York: Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010,  p. 133 At the same time, following a procedure initiated by Domitian, Hadrian made the Emperor's legal advisory board, the consilia principis (\"council of the princeps\") into a permanent body, staffed by salaried legal aides.A. Arthur Schiller, Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development, Walter de Gruyter: 1978,  p. 471 Its members were mostly drawn from the equestrian class, replacing the earlier freedmen of the Imperial household.Salmon, 812R.V. Nind Hopkins, Life of Alexander Severus, CUP Archive, p. 110 This innovation marked the superseding of surviving Republican institutions by an openly autocratic political system.Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, Volume 43, Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1968,  p. 650 The reformed bureaucracy was supposed to exercise administrative functions independently of traditional magistracies; objectively it did not detract from the Senate's position. The new civil servants were free men and as such supposed to act on behalf of the interests of the \"Crown\", not of the Emperor as an individual. However, the Senate never accepted the loss of its prestige caused by the emergence of a new aristocracy alongside it, placing more strain on the already troubled relationship between the Senate and the Emperor.Salmon, 813\n\nHadrian codified the customary legal privileges of the wealthiest, most influential or highest status citizens (described as splendidiores personae or honestiores), who held a traditional right to pay fines when found guilty of relatively minor, non-treasonous offences. Low ranking persons - alii (\"the others\"), including low-ranking citizens - were humiliores who for the same offences could be subject to extreme physical punishments, including forced labour in the mines or in public works, as a form of fixed-term servitude. While Republican citizenship had carried at least notional equality under law, and the right to justice, offences in Imperial courts were judged and punished according to the relative prestige, rank, reputation and moral worth of both parties; senatorial courts were apt to be lenient when trying one of their peers, and to deal very harshly with offences committed against one of their number by low ranking citizens or non-citizens. For treason (maiestas) beheading was the worst punishment that the law could inflict on honestiores; the humiliores might suffer crucifixion, burning, or condemnation to the beasts in the arena.Garnsey, Peter, \"Legal Privilege in the Roman Empire\", Past & Present, No. 41 (Dec., 1968), pp. 9, 13 (note 35), 16, published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/650001 (accessed: 03-12-2017 21:20 UTC) \n\nA great number of Roman citizens maintained a precarious social and economic advantage at the lower end of the hierarchy. Hadrian found it necessary to clarify that decurions, the usually middle-class, elected local officials responsible for running the ordinary, everyday official business of the provinces, counted as honestiores; so did soldiers, veterans and their families, as far as civil law was concerned; by implication, all others, including freedmen and slaves, counted as humliores. Like most Romans, Hadrian seems to have accepted slavery as morally correct, an expression of the same natural order that rewarded \"the best men\" with wealth, power and respect. When confronted by a crowd demanding the freeing of a popular slave charioteer, Hadrian replied that he could not free a slave belonging to another person.Westermann, 109 However, he limited the punishments that slaves could suffer; they could be lawfully tortured to provide evidence, but they could not be lawfully killed unless guilty of a capital offence.Marcel Morabito, Les realités de l'esclavage d'après Le Digeste. Paris: Presses Univ. Franche-C omté, 1981, , p. 230 Masters were also forbidden to sell slaves to a gladiator trainer (lanista) or to a procurer, except as legally justified punishment.Donald G. Kyle, Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome. London: Routledge, 2012, ;William Linn Westermann, The Slave Systems of Greek and Roman Antiquity. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1955, p. 115 Hadrian also forbade torture of free defendants and witnesses.Digest 48.18.21; quoted by Q.F. Robinson, Penal Practice and Penal Policy in Ancient Rome. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, p.107Judith Perkins, Roman Imperial Identities in the Early Christian Era. Abingdon: Routledge, 2009,  He abolished ergastula, private prisons for slaves in which kidnapped free men had sometimes been illegally detained.Christopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order. Oxford University Press, 2012, , p. 102\n\nHadrian issued a general rescript, imposing a ban on castration, performed on freeman or slave, voluntarily or not, on pain of death for both the performer and the patient.Digest, 48.8.4.2, quoted by Paul Du Plessis, Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law. Oxford University Press, 2015, , p. 95 Under the Lex Cornelia de Sicaris et Veneficis, castration was place on a par with conspiracy to murder, and punished accordingly.Peter Schäfer, Judeophobia, 104. Notwithstanding his philhellenism, Hadrian was also a traditionalist. He enforced dress-standards among the honestiores; senators and knights were expected to wear the  toga when in public. He imposed strict separation between the sexes in theaters and public baths; to discourage idleness, the latter were not allowed to open until 2.00 in the afternoon, \"except for medical reasons\".Garzetti, p. 411\n\nReligious\n\nImperial cult\n\nOne of Hadrian's immediate duties on accession was to seek senatorial consent for the apotheosis of his predecessor, Trajan, and any members of Trajan's family to whom he owed a debt of gratitude. During his return from Brittania, Hadrian may have stopped at Nemausus, to oversee the completion of foundation of a basilica dedicated to his patroness Plotina, who had recently died in Rome and had been deified at Hadrian's request.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 145 Shortly before Plotina's death, Hadrian had granted her wish that the leadership of the Epicurean School in Athens be open to a non-Roman candidate.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 108f Matidia Augusta, Hadrian's mother-in-law, had died earlier, in December 119, and had also been deified.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 107\n\nAs Emperor, Hadrian was also Rome's pontifex maximus, responsible for all religious affairs and the proper functioning of official religious institutions throughout the empire. His Hispano-Roman origins and marked pro-Hellenism shifted the focus of the official imperial cult, from Rome to the Provinces. While his standard coin issues still identified him with the traditional genius populi Romani, other issues stressed his personal identification with Hercules Gaditanus (Hercules of Gades), and Rome's imperial protection of Greek civilisation.Gradel, Ittai, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002. , pp. 194-5. He promoted Sagalassos in Greek Pisidia as the Empire's leading Imperial cult centre; his exclusively Greek Panhellenion extolled Athens as the spiritual centre of Greek culture.Howgego, in Howgego, C., Heuchert, V., Burnett, A., (eds), Coinage and Identity in the Roman Provinces, Oxford University Press, 2005. , pp. 6, 10.\n\nAntinous\n\nHadrian was criticized for the open intensity of his grief at Antinous's death, particularly as he had delayed the apotheosis of his own sister Paulina after her death.Hadrian's \"Hellenic\" emotionalism finds a culturally sympathetic echo in the Homeric Achilles' mourning for his friend Patroclus: see discussion in Vout, Caroline, Power and eroticism in Imperial Rome, illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 2007. , pp. 52–135. But his attempt at turning the deceased youth into a cult-figure found little opposition.Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality : Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity. Oxford University Press: 1999, , pp. 60f The cult of Antinous was to become very popular in the Greek-speaking world, and also found support in the West. In Hadrian's villa, statues of the Tyrannicides, with a bearded Aristogeiton and a clean-shaven Harmodios, linked his favourite to the classical tradition of Greek loveElsner, pp. 176f Antinous was also compared to the Celtic sun-god Belenos.Williams, p. 61\n\nMedals were struck with Antinous's effigy, and statues erected to him in all parts of the empire, in all kinds of garb, including Egyptian dress.Jás Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, Oxford History of Art, Oxford U.P., 1998, , p. 183f. Temples were built for his worship in Bithynia and Mantineia in Arcadia. In Athens, festivals were celebrated in his honour and oracles delivered in his name.  Antinous was not part of the state-sponsored, official Roman imperial cult, but provided a common focus for the emperor and his subjects, emphasizing their sense of community.Marco Rizzi, p. 12 As an \"international\" cult figure, Antinous had an enduring fame, far outlasting Hadrian's reign.see Trevor W. Thompson [https://www.academia.edu/9076863/Antinoos_The_New_God_Origen_on_Miracle_and_Belief_in_Third-Century_Egypt \"Antinoos, The New God: Origen on Miracle and Belief in Third Century Egypt\"] for the persistence of Antinous's cult and Christian reactions to it. Freely available. The relationship of P. Oxy. 63.4352 with Diocletian's accession is not entirely clear. Local coins with his effigy were still being struck during Caracalla's reign, and he was invoked in a poem to celebrate the accession of Diocletian.Caroline Vout, Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome. Cambridge University Press; 2007, p. 89\n\nChristians\n\nHadrian continued Trajan's policy on Christians; they should not be sought out, and should only be prosecuted for specific offences, such as refusal to swear oaths.Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 127 and 183. In a rescript addressed to the proconsul of Asia Minutius Fundanus and preserved by Justin Martyr, Hadrian laid down that accusers of Christians had to bear the burden of proof for their denunciationsAlessandro Galimberti, \"Hadrian, Eleusis, and the beginnings of Christian apologetics\" in Marco Rizzi, ed., Hadrian and the Christians. Berlim: De Gruyter, 2010, , pp. 77f or be punished for calumnia (defamation).Robert M. Haddad, The Case for Christianity: St. Justin Martyr's Arguments for Religious Liberty and Judicial Justice. Plymouth: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010, , p. 16\n\nPersonal and cultural interests\n\nHadrian had an abiding and enthusiastic interest in art, architecture and public works. Rome's Pantheon (temple \"to all the gods\"), originally built by Agrippa and destroyed by fire in 80, was partly restored under Trajan and completed under Hadrian in the domed form it retains to this day. Hadrian's Villa at Tibur (Tivoli) provides the greatest Roman equivalent of an Alexandrian garden, complete with domed Serapeum, recreating a sacred landscape.It was lost in large part to despoliation by the Cardinal d'Este, who had much of the marble removed to build the Villa d'Este in the 16th century. An epitome of Cassius Dio provides an anecdote that suggests Hadrian had a high opinion of his own architectural tastes and talents, and took their rejection as a personal offense: at some time before his reign, his predecessor Trajan was discussing an architectural problem with Apollodorus of Damascus - architect and designer of Trajan's Forum, the Column commemorating his Dacian conquest, and his bridge across the Danube - when Hadrian interrupted to offer his advice. Apollodorus gave him a scathing response: \"Be off, and draw your gourds [a sarcastic reference to the domes which Hadrian apparently liked to draw]. You don't understand any of these matters. Dio also claims that once Hadrian became emperor, he showed Apollodorus drawings of the gigantic Temple of Venus and Roma, implying that great buildings could be created without his help. When Apollodorus pointed out the building's various insoluble problems and faults, Hadrian was enraged, sent him into exile,and later put him to death on trumped up charges.Brickstamps with consular dates show that the Pantheon's dome was late in Trajan's reign (115), probably under Apollodorus's supervision: see Ilan Vit-Suzan, Architectural Heritage Revisited: A Holistic Engagement of its Tangible and Intangible Constituents , Farnham: Ashgate, 2014, , p. 20Cassius Dio, \"Roman History\", 69.4, Loeb Classical Library edition, 1925[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/69*.html]\n\nHadrian wrote poetry in both Latin and Greek; one of the few surviving examples is a Latin poem he reportedly composed on his deathbed (see below). Some of his Greek productions found their way into the Palatine Anthology.Juan Gil & Sofía Torallas Tovar, Hadrianus. Barcelona: CSIC, 2010, , p. 100Direct links to Hadrian's poems in the A.P. with W.R. Paton's translation at the Internet Archive \n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology01pato#page/474/mode/2up VI 332],\n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology00patogoog#page/n375/mode/2up VII 674], \n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology03pato#page/70/mode/2up IX 137],\n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology03pato#page/216/mode/2up IX 387] He also wrote an autobiography, which Historia Augusta says was published under the name of Hadrian's freedman Phlegon of Tralles. It was not, apparently, a work of great length or revelation, but designed to scotch various rumours or explain Hadrian's most controversial actions.T. J. Cornell, ed., The Fragments of the Roman Historians. Oxford University Press: 2013, p. 591 It is possible that this autobiography had the form of a series of open letters to Antoninus Pius.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 26\n\nAccording to one source, Hadrian was a passionate hunter from a young age.Historia Augusta, Hadrian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2 2.1]. In northwest Asia, he founded and dedicated a city to commemorate a she-bear he killed.Fox, Robin The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian Basic Books. 2006 p. 574 It is documented that in Egypt he and his beloved Antinous killed a lion. In Rome, eight reliefs featuring Hadrian in different stages of hunting decorate a building that began as a monument celebrating a kill.\n\nHadrian's philhellenism may have been one reason for his adoption, like Nero before him, of the beard as suited to Roman imperial dignity; Dio of Prusa had equated the growth of the beard with the Hellenic ethos.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 62. Hadrian's beard may also have served to conceal his natural facial blemishes.The Historia Augusta however claims that [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#26.1 \"he wore a full beard to cover up the natural blemishes on his face\"], H.A. 26.1 Most emperors before him had been clean-shaven; most who came after him were bearded, at least until Constantine the Great.\n\nHadrian was familiar with the Stoic philosophers Epictetus, and Favorinus, and with their works. During his first stay in Greece, before he became emperor, he attended lectures by Epictetus at Nicopolis.Robin Lane Fox, The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian. Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2006, , p.578\n\nDuring Hadrian's time as Tribune of the Plebs, omens and portents supposedly announced his future imperial condition.For instance, a probably bogus anecdote in Historia Augusta relates that as tribune he had lost a cloak that emperors never wore: Michael Reiche, ed., Antike Autobiographien: Werke, Epochen, Gattungen. Köln: Böhlau, 2005, , p.225 According to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian had a great interest in astrology and divination and had been told of his future accession to the Empire by a grand-uncle who was himself a skilled astrologer.Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Cornell University Press: 2007, , p. 177\n\nPoem by Hadrian\n\nAccording to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian composed the following poem shortly before his death:Historia Augusta, Hadrian Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#25.9 25.9]; Antony Birley, p. 301\n\nAnimula, vagula, blandula\nHospes comesque corporis\nQuae nunc abibis in loca\nPallidula, rigida, nudula,\nNec, ut soles, dabis iocos...\n\n::P. Aelius Hadrianus Imp.\n\nRoving amiable little soul,\nBody's companion and guest,\nNow descending for parts\nColourless, unbending, and bare\nYour usual distractions no more shall be there...\n\nThe poem has enjoyed remarkable popularity,see e.g.[http://coldewey.cc/post/17072720047/forty-three-translations-of-hadrians-animula Forty-three translations of Hadrian's \"Animula, vagula, blandula ...\" ]  including translations by Henry Vaughan, A.

S. Eliot's poem \"Animula\" may have been inspired by Hadrian's, though the relationship is not unambiguous.Russell E.

Eliot: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work], 2007. p.48\n\nAppraisals\n\nHadrian has been described as the most versatile of all Roman emperors.Varius multiplex multiformis in the anonymous, ancient Epitome de Caesaribus, 14.6: cf Ronald Syme, among others; see Ando, footnote 172 Schiller called Hadrian \"the Empire's first servant\". Edward Gibbon admired his \"vast and active genius\" and his \"equity and moderation\". In 1776, he stated that Hadrian's era was part of the \"happiest era of human history\". In his Meditations, written during his reign as emperor, Marcus Aurelius lists those to whom he owes a debt of gratitude; Hadrian is conspicuously absent.McLynn, 42 Hadrian's tense, authoritarian relationship with his senate was acknowledged a generation after his death by Fronto, himself a senator, who wrote in one of his letters to Marcus Aurelius that \"I praised the deified Hadrian, your grandfather, in the senate on a number of occasions with great enthusiasm, and I did this willingly, too [...] But, if it can be said – respectfully acknowledging your devotion towards your grandfather – I wanted to appease and assuage Hadrian as I would Mars Gradivus or Dis Pater, rather than to love him.\"\"Wytse Keulen, Eloquence rules: the ambiguous image of Hadrian in Fronto's correspondence\". [http://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/literaryinteractions/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Eloquence-rules-working-paper1.pdf] Retrieved February 20, 2015 Fronto adds, in another letter, that he kept some friendships, during Hadrian's reign, \"under the risk of my life\" (cum periculo capitis).James Uden (2010). \"The Contest of Homer and Hesiod and the ambitions of Hadrian\". Journal of Hellenic Studies, 130 (2010), pp. 121-135.[https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/5437/uden_jhs_2010.pdf?sequence=1]. Accessed October 16, 2017 The veiled antagonism between Hadrian and the Senate never grew to overt confrontation as had happened during the reigns of overtly \"bad\" emperors, because Hadrian knew how to remain aloof and avoid an open clash.Paul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, p. 40 That Hadrian spent half of his reign away from Rome in constant travel undoubtedly helped the management of this strained relationship.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 1\n\nThe Senate's political role was effaced behind Hadrian's personal rule (in Ronald Syme's view. Hadrian \"was a Führer, a Duce, a Caudillo\").Apud Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 65 Hadrian underscored the autocratic character of his reign by counting his dies imperii from the day of his acclamation by the armies, rather than the senate, and legislating by frequent use of imperial decrees to bypass the Senate's approval.Edward Togo Salmon,A History of the Roman World from 30 B.C. to A.D. 138.

Accessed April 30, 2017\n\nSources and historiography\n\nIn Hadrian's time, there was already a well established convention that one could not write a contemporary Roman imperial history for fear of contradicting what the emperors wanted to say, read or hear about themselves.Steven H. Rutledge, \"Writing Imperial Politics: The Social and Political Background\" IN William J. Dominik, ed;, Writing Politics in Imperial Rome Brill, 2009, , p.60Adam M. Kemezis, \"Lucian, Fronto, and the absence of contemporary historiography under the Antonines\". The American Journal of Philology Vol. 131, No. 2 (Summer 2010), pp. 285–325 Political histories of Hadrian's reign come mostly from later sources, some of them written centuries after the reign itself. Book69 of the early 3rd-century Roman History by Cassius Dio gives a general account of Hadrian's reign, but the original is lost; what survives is a brief, Byzantine-era abridgment by the 11th-century monk Xiphilinius, focussed on Hadrian's religious interests and the Bar Kokhba war, and little else. Hadrian's is the first in the series of probably late 4th-century imperial biographies known as Historia Augusta. The collection as a whole is notorious for its unreliability (\"a mish mash of actual fact, cloak and dagger, sword and sandal, with a sprinkling of Ubu Roi\"),Paul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain. Paris: Seuil, 2005, , p.312. In the French original: de l'Alexandre Dumas, du péplum et un peu d'Ubu Roi. but most modern historians consider its account of Hadrian to be relatively free of outright fictions, and probably based on sound historical sources.Danèel den Hengst, Emperors and Historiography: Collected Essays on the Literature of the Roman Empire. Leiden: Brill, 2010, , p. 93 Its principal source is generally assumed, on the basis of indirect evidence, to be one of a lost series of imperial biographies by the prominent 3rd-century senator Marius Maximus, covering the reigns of Nerva through to Elagabalus.Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds., The Cambridge Ancient History', XI: the High Empire, 70–192 A.D.Cambridge University Press, 2000, , p. 132 Greek authors such as Philostratus and Pausanias, who wrote shortly after Hadrian's reign, confined their scope to the general historical framework that shaped Hadrian's decisions, especially those relating to Greece. Fronto left Latin correspondence and works attesting to Hadrian's character and his reign's internal politics.Mary Taliaferro Boatwright, Hadrian and the Cities of the Roman Empire. Princeton University Press, 2002, pp.20/26 \n\nIn modern scholarship, these accounts are supplemented by epigraphical, numismatic, archaeological, and other non-literary sources, without which no detailed, chronological account would be possible; the first modern historian to attempt such an account was the German 19th-century medievalist Ferdinand Gregorovius.Anthony R Birley, Hadrian: The Restless Emperor. Abingdon: Routledge, 2013, , p.7Birley, Hadrian: the Restless Emperor, 7: Birley describes the results of Ernst Kornemann's attempt to sift the Historia Augusta biography's facts from its fictions (through textual analysis alone) as doubtful.\n\nGerman historian Wilhelm Weber produced a 1907 biography of Hadrian. Weber was an extreme German nationalist and later a Nazi Party supporter. In keeping with his general view on Roman history, his views on Hadrian, and especially the Bar Kokhba war, are ideologically loaded.Thomas E. Jenkins, Antiquity Now: The Classical World in the Contemporary American Imagination. Cambridge University Press: 2015, , paget121A'haron Oppenheimer, Between Rome and Babylon: Studies in Jewish Leadership and Society.Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005, , page 199 The 1923 Hadrian English biography by B.W. Henderson is more readable in the way of a summing-up and interpretation of the written sources, but Henderson's anti-German bias made him completely ignore Weber's study of the non-literary sources.\n\nOnly after the development of epigraphical studies in the post-war period could an alternate historiography of Hadrian develop, that leaned less on the ancient literary tradition. The ancient tradition had as its leitmotif a comparison between Hadrian and Trajan- mostly to the former's disadvantage. On the other hand, modern historiography on Hadrian sought to explore the meaning (as in the title of a recent summing-up work by the German historian Susanne Mortensen)Susanne Mortensen: Hadrian. Eine Deutungsgeschichte. Habelt, Bonn 2004,  attached by Hadrian to his policies on various fields, as well as the particular aspects of these policies. According to historians such as the Italian M.A. Levi, a summing-up of Hadrian's policies should stress the ecumenical character of the Empire, his development of an alternate bureaucracy disconnected from the Senate and adapted to the needs of an \"enlightened\" autocracy, as well as his overall defensive grand strategy. According to Levi, that would be enough to allow us to consider Hadrian as a grand Roman political reformer, the creator of an absolute monarchy in the place of a senatorial republic – even a sham one.Franco Sartori, \"L'oecuménisme d'un empereur souvent méconnu : [review of] M.A. Levi, Adriano, un ventennio di cambiamento\".

Retrieved January 19, 2017 British historian Robin Lane Fox, in his book about the Classical World, credits Hadrian with the creation of a unified Greco-Roman cultural tradition, but at the same time he considers Hadrian to be the end of this same tradition, as Hadrian's \"restoration\" of the Classical Age into the framework of an undemocratic Empire simply emptied it of substantive meaning, or, in Fox's words, \"kill[ed] it with kindness\".The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian. New York: Basic Books, 2006, , page 4 The latest (1997) English biography by Anthony Birley sums up and reflect these developments in Hadrian historiography.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations",

He was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus, probably at Italica, near Santiponce (in modern-day Spain), into a Hispano-Roman family with centuries-old roots in Hispania.Alicia M. Canto, [https://www.academia.edu/1082511/It%C3%A1lica_sedes_natalis_de_Adriano._31_textos_hist%C3%B3ricos_y_argumentos_para_una_secular_pol%C3%A9mica_2004_ Itálica, sedes natalis de Adriano. 31 textos históricos y argumentos para una secular polémica], Athenaeum XCII/2, 2004, 367-408. His father was a maternal cousin of the emperor Trajan. Some years before Hadrian's accession, he married Trajan's grand-niece, Vibia Sabina. While Trajan did not officially designate an heir, his close friend and adviser Licinius Sura was well disposed towards Hadrian. Trajan's wife, Pompeia Plotina, claimed that her husband had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death.  \n\nRome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but soon after, four leading senators who had opposed Hadrian, or seemed to threaten his position, were unlawfully put to death; the senate held Hadrian responsible for this, and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and recent territorial gains in Mesopotamia, Assyria and Armenia, and parts of Dacia. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders, and the unification, under his overall leadership, of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia. Late in his reign he suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea; with this major exception, Hadrian's reign was generally peaceful.\n\nHadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests; accompanied by a probably vast Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators, he visited almost every province of the Empire. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and fostered, designed or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt or completed the Pantheon, and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria. An ardent admirer of Greece, he sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the Empire and ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with the Greek youth Antinous, and the latter's untimely death, led to Hadrian's establishment of an enduring and widespread popular cult. \n\nHadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. He saw the bar Kokhba revolt as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. His execution of two more senators for their alleged plots against him provoked further resentment. His marriage to Vibia Sabina had been unhappy, and childless; in 138 he adopted Antoninus Pius and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as his own heirs. Hadrian died the same year at Baiae, and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. Thereafter, Roman histories present Hadrian as a complex and difficult character. British historian Edward Gibbon includes him among the Empire's \"Five good emperors\", a \"benevolent dictator\"; Hadrian's own senate found him remote and authoritarian. He has been described as enigmatic and contradictory, with a capacity for both great personal generosity and extreme cruelty, and driven by insatiable curiosity, self-conceit, and above all, ambition.Ando, Clifford. “Phoenix.” Phoenix, vol. 52, no. 1/2, 1998, pp. 183–185. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1088268. Modern interest was revived largely thanks to Marguerite Yourcenar's novel Mémoires d'Hadrien (1951).\n\nEarly life\n\nHadrian was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in either Italica (near modern Seville) in the province of Hispania BaeticaAlicia M. Canto, \"Itálica, patria y ciudad natal de Adriano (31 textos históricos y argumentos contra Vita Hadr). His father died in AD 86 when Hadrian was at the age of 10. 1, 3\", Athenaeum vol.92.2, 2004, pp.367–408 [http://dobc.unipv.it/dipscant/athenaeum/athenaeum.html UNIPV.it]  or Rome,Ronald Syme, in his paper \"Hadrian and Italica\" (Journal of Roman Studies, LIV, 1964; pp.142–149) supported the position that Rome was Hadrian's birthplace. Canto, however, argues that only one extant ancient source gives Hadrian's birthplace as Rome (SHA, Vita Hadr 2,4, probably interpolated), as opposed to 25 other sources affirming that he was born in Italica. Among these alternative sources is Hadrian's own imperial horoscope, included in the surviving fragments of an astrological compendium attributed to Antigonus of Nicaea, written during the late 2nd century:cf. Stephan Heiler, \"The Emperor Hadrian in the Horoscopes of Antigonus of Nicaea\", in Günther Oestmann, H. Darrel Rutkin, Kocku von Stuckrad, eds.,Horoscopes and Public Spheres: Essays on the History of Astrology. Berlim: Walter de Gruyter, 2005, , page 49. This horoscope was well studied by prominent authors such as F.H. Cramer, Astrology in Roman Law and Politics, Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 37, Philadelphia, 1954 (repr. 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?idzv0UAAAAIAAJ&pgis\n1 see] for Hadrian pp.162–178, fn. 121b and 122, etc.: \"... Hadrian – whose horoscope is absolutely certainsurely was born in southern Spain ... (in) SHA, Hadrian, 2, 4, the birth was erroneously assigned to Rome instead of Italica, the actual birthplace of Hadrian...\", or O.Neugebauer and H.B. Van Hoesen in their magisterial compilation Greek Horoscopes, Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 48, Philadelphia, 1959, nr.L76, see now [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEgnLpm06zQC here, ed. 1987] pp.80, 90–1, and his footnote 19. They came also to the conclusion that the astronomic parallel of the Hadrian's birth is situated in the Baetica, today Andalusia: \"...L40 agrees exactly with the geographical latitude of southern Spain, the place of origin of Hadrian and his family...\".. \"since Hadrian was born in Italica (southern Spain, near Seville, latitude about 37° 30)...\". to a well-established Roman family with centuries-old roots in Italica. His biography in the Historia Augusta states that he was born in Rome on 24January 76 to an ethnically Hispanic family with vague paternal links to Italy, though this may be a complimentary fiction coined to make Hadrian appear a natural-born Roman instead of a provincial whose parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were born and raised in Hispania.Historia Augusta, 'Hadrian', I-II, here explicitly citing the autobiography. This is one of the passages in the Historia Augusta where there is no reason to suspect invention. But see now the Canto's 31 contrary arguments in the op.cit. supra; among them, in the same Historia Augusta and, from the same author, Aelius Spartianus, Vita Sev. 21: Falsus est etiam ipse Traianus in suo municipe ac nepote diligendo, see also :es:Adriano#cite note-nacimiento-0, and, characterizing him as a man of provinces (Canto, ibid.): Vita Hadr. 1,3: Quaesturam gessit Traiano quater et Articuleio consulibus, in qua cum orationem imperatoris in senatu agrestius pronuntians risus esset, usque ad summam peritiam et facundiam Latinis operam dedit It was general knowledge that Hadrian and his predecessor Trajan werein the words of Aurelius Victor\"aliens\", people \"from the outside\" (advenae).Alicia M. Canto, \"La dinastía Ulpio-Aelia (96–192 d.C.): ni tan Buenos, ni tan Adoptivos ni tan Antoninos\". Gerión (21.1): 263–305. 2003\n\nHadrian's father was Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, who as a senator of praetorian rank would have spent much of his time in Rome.On the numerous senatorial families from Spain residing at Rome and its vicinity around the time of Hadrian's birth see R. Syme, 'Spaniards at Tivoli', in Roman Papers IV (Oxford, 1988), pp.96–114. Tivoli (Tibur) was of course the site of Hadrian's own imperial villa. Hadrian's known paternal ancestry can be partly linked to a family from Hadria (modern Atri), an ancient town in Picenum, Italy. This family had settled in Italica soon after its founding by Scipio Africanus several centuries before Hadrian's birth. Hadrian's father, Afer, and his paternal cousin, the Emperor Trajan, were both born and raised in Hispania. Hadrian's mother was Domitia Paulina, daughter of a distinguished Hispano-Roman senatorial family from Gades (Cádiz).Royston Lambert, Beloved And God, pp.31–32. \n\nHadrian's elder sister and only sibling was Aelia Domitia Paulina, married to Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, who was consul three times. Hadrian also had a niece, Julia Serviana Paulina, and a great-nephew, Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator, from Barcino (Barcelona). In 86, when Hadrian was ten years old, his parents died, and he became a ward of both Trajan and Publius Acilius Attianus (who was later Trajan's Praetorian prefect). Hadrian was physically active, and enjoyed hunting; when he was 14, Trajan called him to Rome and arranged his further schooling in subjects appropriate to a young Roman aristocrat. Hadrian proved so fond of Greek literature that he was nicknamed Graeculus (\"Greekling\").\n\nPublic service\n\nHadrian's first official post in Rome was as a judge at the Inheritance court, one among many vigintivirate offices at the lowest level of the cursus honorum (\"course of honours\") that could lead to higher office and a senatorial career. He then served as a military tribune, first with the LegioII Adiutrix in 95, then with the Legio V Macedonica. During Hadrian's second stint as tribune, the frail and aged reigning emperor Nerva adopted Trajan as his heir; Hadrian was dispatched to give Trajan the news— or most probably was one of many emissaries charged with this same commission.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.37 Then he was transferred to Legio XXII Primigenia and a third tribunate.John D. Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96–99. Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, , p. 109 Hadrian's three tribunates gave him some career advantage. Most scions of the older senatorial families might serve one, or at most two military tribunates as a prerequisite to higher office.Thorsten Opper, The Emperor Hadrian. British Museum Press, 2008, p.39Jörg Fündling, Kommentar zur Vita Hadriani der Historia Augusta (= Antiquitas. Reihe 4: Beiträge zur Historia-Augusta-Forschung, Serie 3: Kommentare, Bände 4.1 und 4.2). Habelt, Bonn 2006, , p. 351. When Nerva died in 98, Hadrian is said to have hastened to Trajan, to inform him ahead of the official envoy sent by the governor, Hadrian's brother-in-law and rival Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus.John D. Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis, p. 109; Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds. The Cambridge Ancient History – XI. Cambridge U. P.: 2000, , p. 133.\n\nIn 101, Hadrian was back in Rome; he was elected quaestor, then quaestor imperatoris Traiani, liaison officer between Emperor and the assembled Senate, to whom he read the Emperor's communiqués and speeches – which he possibly composed on the emperor's behalf. In his role as imperial ghostwriter, Hadrian took the place of the recently deceased Licinius Sura, Trajan's all-powerful friend and kingmaker.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.54 His next post was as ab actis senatus, keeping the Senate's records.Boatwright, in Barrett, p. 158 During the First Dacian War, Hadrian took the field as a member of Trajan's personal entourage, but was excused from his military post to take office in Rome as Tribune of the Plebs, in 105. After the war, he was probably elected praetor.The text of Historia Augusta (Vita Hadriani, 3.8) is garbled, stating that Hadrian's election to the praetorship was contemporary \"to the second consulate of Suburanus and Servianus\" – two characters that had non-simultaneous second consulships – so Hadrian's election could be dated to 102 or 104, the later date being the most accepted During the Second Dacian War, Hadrian was in Trajan's personal service again, but was released to serve as legate of Legio I Minervia, then as governor of Lower Pannonia in 107, tasked with \"holding back the Sarmatians\".Bowman, p. 133Anthony Everitt, 2013, Chapter XI: \"holding back the Sarmatians\" may simply have meant maintaining and patrolling the border. \n\nNow in his mid-thirties, Hadrian travelled to Greece; he was granted Athenian citizenship and was appointed eponymous archon of Athens for a brief time (in 112).The inscription in footnote 1 The Athenians awarded him a statue with an inscription in the Theater of Dionysus ( IG II2 3286) offering a detailed account of his cursus honorum thus far.The Athenian inscription confirms and expands the one in Historia Augusta; see John Bodel, ed., Epigraphic Evidence: Ancient History From Inscriptions. Abingdon: Routledge, 2006, , p. 89His career in office up to 112/113 is attested by the Athens inscription, 112 AD: CIL III, 550 InscrAtt 3 \n IG II, 3286 Dessau 308 \n IDRE 2, 365: decemvir stlitibus iudicandis/ sevir turmae equitum Romanorum/ praefectus Urbi feriarum Latinarum/ tribunus militum legionis II Adiutricis Piae Fidelis (95, in Pannonia Inferior)/ tribunus militum legionis V Macedonicae (96, in Moesia Inferior)/ tribunus militum legionis XXII Primigeniae Piae Fidelis (97, in Germania Superior)/ quaestor (101)/ ab actis senatus/ tribunus plebis (105)/ praetor (106)/ legatus legionis I Minerviae Piae Fidelis (106, in Germania Inferior)/ legatus Augusti pro praetore Pannoniae Inferioris (107)/ consul suffectus (108)/ septemvir epulonum (before 112)/ sodalis Augustalis (before 112)/ archon Athenis (112/13). \n\nHe also held office as legatus Syriae (117): see H.W. Benario in [http://www.roman-emperors.org/hadrian.htm Roman-emperors.org] Thereafter no more is heard of him until Trajan's Parthian War. It is possible that he remained in Greece until his recall to the imperial retinue.\n\nHadrian joined Trajan's expedition against Parthia as a legate.Anthony Birley, Hadrian the Restless Emperor, p.68 When the governor of Syria was sent to deal with renewed troubles in Dacia, Hadrian was appointed his replacement, with independent command.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, p.75 Trajan became seriously ill, and took ship for Rome, while Hadrian remained in Syria, de facto general commander of the Eastern Roman army.Karl Strobel: Kaiser Traian. Eine Epoche der Weltgeschichte. Regensburg:  2010, p. 401. Trajan got as far as the coastal city of Selinus, in Cilicia; he was too ill to travel any further. He died there, on 8 August; he would be regarded as one of Rome's most admired, popular and best emperors. \n\nRelationship with Trajan and his family\n\nAround the time of his quaestorship, in 100 or 101, Hadrian had married Trajan's twelve-year-old grandniece, Vibia Sabina. The marriage might have been arranged by Trajan's empress, Plotina. This highly cultured, influential woman shared many of Hadrian's values and interests, including the idea of the Roman Empire as a commonwealth with an underlying Hellenic culture.Hidalgo de la Vega, Maria José:  \"Plotina, Sabina y Las Dos Faustinas: La Función de Las Augustas en La Politica Imperial\".

Allen, The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia, Jefferson: Mcfarland, 2006, , p.120\n\nHadrian's personal relationship with Trajan was complex, and may have been difficult. Hadrian seems to have sought influence over Trajan, or Trajan's decisions, through cultivation of the latter's boy favourites; this gave rise to some unexplained quarrel, around the time of Hadrian's marriage to Sabina.Thorsten Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict.

Leiden: Brill, 2011, , p.375 The Historia Augusta describes Trajan's gift to Hadrian of a diamond ring that Trajan himself had received from Nerva, which \"encouraged [Hadrian's] hopes of succeeding to the throne\".Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 3.7In 23 BC Augustus handed a similar ring to his heir apparent, Agrippa: see Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante, eds., The World of Roman Costume. University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 78 While Trajan actively promoted Hadrian's advancement, he did so with caution.Fündling, 351\n\nSuccession\n\nFailure to nominate an heir could invite chaotic, destructive wresting of power by a succession of competing claimants - a civil war. Too early a nomination could be seen as an abdication, and reduce the chance for an orderly transmission of power.Fündling, 384; Strobel, 401. As Trajan lay dying, nursed by his wife, Plotina, and closely watched by Prefect Attianus, he could have lawfully adopted Hadrian as heir, by means of a simple deathbed wish, expressed before witnesses;John Richardson, \"The Roman Mind and the power of fiction\" IN Lewis Ayres, Ian Gray Kidd, eds. The Passionate Intellect: Essays on the Transformation of Classical Traditions : Presented to Professor I.G. Kidd. New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1995, , p. 128 but when an adoption document was eventually presented, it was signed not by Trajan but by Plotina, and was dated the day after Trajan's death.Elizabeth Speller, p. 25 That Hadrian was still in Syria was a further irregularity, as Roman adoption law required the presence of both parties at the adoption ceremony. Rumours, doubts, and speculation attended Hadrian's adoption and succession. It has been suggested that Trajan's young manservant Phaedimus, who died very soon after Trajan, was killed (or killed himself) rather than face awkward questions.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 80 Ancient sources are divided on the legitimacy of Hadrian's adoption: Dio Cassius saw it as bogus and the Historia Augusta writer as genuine.Stephan Brassloff, \"Die Rechtsfrage bei der Adoption Hadrians\".

Various public ceremonies were organized on Hadrian's behalf, celebrating his \"divine election\" by all the gods, whose community now included Trajan, deified at Hadrian's request.Egyptian papyri tell of one such ceremony betwee n 117 and 118; see Michael Peppard, The Son of God in the Roman World: Divine Sonship in Its Social and Political Context.

In Rome, Attianus, Hadrian's former guardian, took charge as Praetorian Prefect. He claimed to have uncovered a conspiracy involving four leading senators, who included Lusius Quietus.Elizabeth Speller. There was no public trial for the four – they were tried in absentia, hunted down and killed. Hadrian claimed that Attianus had acted on his own initiative, and rewarded him with senatorial status and consular rank; then pensioned him off, no later than 120.It is likely that Hadrian found Attianus' ambition suspect. Attianus was likely dead, or executed, by the end of Hadrian's reign; see Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?: ascension des élites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste à Hadrien, 27 av. J.-C.-138 ap. J.-C. Madrid: Casa de Velázquez, 2005, , p. 611 Hadrian assured the senate that henceforth their ancient right to prosecute and judge their own would be respected. \n\nThe reasons for these four executions remain obscure. Official recognition of Hadrian as legitimate heir may have come too late to dissuade other potential claimants.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, 55 Hadrian's greatest rivals were Trajan's closest friends, the most experienced and senior members of the imperial council;John Antony Crook, Consilium Principis: Imperial Councils and Counsellors from Augustus to Diocletian. Cambridge University Press: 1955, pp. 54f any of them might have been a legitimate competitor for the imperial office (capaces imperii);Marasco, p. 377 and any of them might have supported Trajan's expansionist policies, which Hadrian intended to change.M. Christol & D. Nony, Rome et son Empire. Paris: Hachette, 2003, , p. 158 One of their number was Aulus Cornelius Palma who as a former conqueror of Arabia Nabatea would have retained a stake in the East.Hadrien Bru, Le pouvoir impérial dans les provinces syriennes: Représentations et célébrations d'Auguste à Constantin. Leiden: Brill, 2011, , pp. 46f The Historia Augusta describes Palma and a third executed senator, Lucius Publilius Celsus (consul for the second time in 113), as Hadrian's personal enemies, who had spoken in public against him.Carcopino Jérôme. \"L'hérédité dynastique chez les Antonins\". Revue des Études Anciennes. Tome 51, 1949, no.3–4. pp. 262–321. The fourth was Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, an ex-consul, intellectual, friend of Pliny the Younger and (briefly) Governor of Dacia at the start of Hadrian's reign. He was probably Hadrian's chief rival for the throne; a senator of highest rank, breeding, and connections; according to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian had considered making Nigrinus his heir apparent, before deciding to get rid of him.Cizek, \"L'éloge de Caius Avidius Nigrinus\"Nigrinus' ambiguous relationship with Hadrian would have consequences late in Hadrian's reign, when he had to plan his own succession; see Anthony Everitt, Hadrian and the triumph of Rome. New York: Random House, 2009, .\n\nSoon after, in 125, Hadrian appointed Marcius Turbo as his Praetorian Prefect.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 91 Turbo was his close friend, a leading figure of the equestrian order, a senior court judge and aprocurator.Christol & Nony, p. 158Richard P. Saller, Personal Patronage Under the Early Empire. Cambridge Un iversity Press: 2002, , p. 140 As Hadrian also forbade equestrians to try cases against senators,Richard A. Bauman, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Rome. London: Routledge, 2002, , p. 83 the Senate retained full legal authority over its members; it also remained the highest court of appeal, and formal appeals to the emperor regarding its decisions were forbidden.Digest, 49 2, I,2, quoted by P.E. Corbett, \"The Legislation of Hadrian\". University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register,  Vol. 74, No. 8 (Jun., 1926), pp. 753–766 If this was an attempt to repair the damage done by Attianus, with or without Hadrian's full knowledge, it was not enough; Hadrian's reputation and relationship with his Senate were iredeemably soured, for the rest of his reign.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 88 Some sources describe Hadrian's occasional recourse to a network of informers, the frumentariiChristopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order.

London: Routledge, 2004, , p. 253\n\nTravels\n\nHadrian was to spend more than half his reign outside Italy. Whereas previous emperors had, for the most part, relied on the reports of their imperial representatives around the Empire, Hadrian wished to see things for himself. Previous emperors had often left Rome for long periods, but mostly to go to war, returning once the conflict was settled. Hadrian's near-incessant travels may represent a calculated break with traditions and attitudes in which the empire was a purely Roman hegemony. Hadrian sought to include provincials in a commonwealth of civilized peoples and a common Hellenic culture under Roman supervision.Paul Veyne, Le Pain et le Cirque, Paris: Seuil, 1976, , p. 655 He supported the creation of provincial towns (municipia), semi-autonomous urban communities with their own customs and laws, rather than the imposition of new Roman colonies with Roman constitutions.András Mócsy, Pannonia and Upper Moesia (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire, Routledge, 2014 \n\nThe cosmopolitan, ecumenical intent of Hadrian's travels is evident in coin issues of his later reign, showing the emperor \"raising up\" the personifications of various provinces.Paul Veyne, \" Humanitas: Romans and non-Romans\". In Andrea Giardina, ed., The Romans, University of Chicago Press: 1993, , p. 364 The Greek rhetorician Aelius Aristides later wrote that Hadrian \"extended over his subjects a protecting hand, raising them as one helps fallen men on their feet\".Christol & Nony, p. 159. All this did not go well with Roman traditionalists. The self-indulgent emperor Nero had enjoyed a prolonged and peaceful tour of Greece, and had been criticised by the Roman elite for abandoning his fundamental responsibilities as emperor. In the eastern provinces, and to some extent in the west, Nero had enjoyed popular support; claims of his imminent return or rebirth emerged almost immediately after his death. Hadrian may have consciously exploited these positive, popular connections during his own travels.Larry Joseph Kreitzer, Striking New Images: Roman Imperial Coinage and the New Testament World. Sheffield: A & C Black, 1996, , pp. 194ff In the Historia Augusta, Hadrian is described as \"a little too much Greek\", too  cosmopolitan for a Roman emperor.Simon Goldhill, Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 12 \n\nBritannia and the West (122)\n\nPrior to Hadrian's arrival in Britannia, the province had suffered a major rebellion, from 119 to 121.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 123 Inscriptions tell of an expeditio Britannica that involved major troop movements, including the dispatch of a detachment (vexillatio), comprising some 3,000 soldiers. Fronto writes about military losses in Britannia at the time.Opper, p. 79 Coin legends of 119-120 attest that Pompeius Falco was sent to restore order. In 122 Hadrian initiated the construction of a wall, \"to separate Romans from barbarians\".Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Hadrian, xi, 2 This deterred attacks on Roman territory at a lower cost than a massed border army,Patrick le Roux, Le haut-Empire romain en Occident d'Auguste aux Sévères. Paris: Seuil, 1998, , p. 396 and controlled cross-border trade and immigration.Breeze, David J., and Brian Dobson, \"Hadrian's Wall: Some Problems\", Britannia, Vol. 3, (1972), pp. 182–208 A shrine was erected in York to Brittania as the divine personification of Britain; Coins were struck, bearing her image, identified as BRITANNIA. By the end of 122, Hadrian had concluded his visit to Britannia. He never saw the finished wall that bears his name.\n\nHadrian appears to have continued through southern Gaul. At Nemausus, he may have overseen the building of a basilica dedicated to his patroness Plotina, who had recently died in Rome and had been deified at Hadrian's request.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 145 At around this time, Hadrian dismissed his secretary ab epistulis, the historian Suetonius, for \"excessive familiarity\" towards the empress.Jason König, Katerina Oikonomopoulou, Greg Woolf, eds. Ancient Libraries. Cambridge U. Press: 2013, , page 251 Marcius Turbo's colleague as Praetorian Prefect, Gaius Septicius Clarus was dismissed for the same alleged reason, perhaps a pretext to remove him from office.Anthony Everitt, Hadrian and the triumph of Rome. Hadrian spent the winter of 122/123 at Tarraco, in Spain, where he restored the Temple of Augustus.William E. Mierse, Temples and Towns in Roman Iberia: The Social and Architectural Dynamics of Sanctuary Designs from the Third Century B.C. to the Third Century A.D.. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, , page 141\n\nAfrica, Parthia and Anatolia; Antinous (123–124)\n\nIn 123, Hadrian crossed the Mediterranean to Mauretania, where he personally led a minor campaign against local rebels.Royston Lambert, pp. 41–2 The visit was cut short by reports of war preparations by Parthia; Hadrian quickly headed eastwards. At some point, he visited Cyrene, where he personally funded the training of young men from well-bred families for the Roman military. Cyrene had benefited earlier (in 119) from his restoration of public buildings destroyed during the earlier Jewish revolt.Anthony Birley, pp. 151–2The rebuilding continued until late in Hadrian's reign; in 138 a statue of Zeus was erected there, dedicated to Hadrian as Cyrene's \"saviour and founder\". See E. Mary Smallwood, The Jews Under Roman Rule from Pompey to Diocletian : a Study in Political Relations. Leiden, Brill, 2001, 0-391-04155-X, p. 410\n\nWhen Hadrian arrived on the Euphrates, he personally negotiated a settlement with the Parthian King Osroes I, inspected the Roman defences, then set off westwards, along the Black Sea coast.Anthony Birley, pp. 153–5 He probably wintered in Nicomedia, the main city of Bithynia. Nicomedia had been hit by an earthquake only shortly before his stay; Hadrian provided funds for its rebuilding, and was acclaimed as restorer of the province.Anthony Birley, pp. 157–8\n\nIt is possible that Hadrian visited Claudiopolis and saw the beautiful Antinous, a young man of humble birth who became Hadrian's beloved. Literary and epigraphic sources say nothing on when or where they met; depictions of Antinous show him aged 20 or so, shortly before his death in 130. In 123 he would most likely have been a youth of 13 or 14. It is also possible that Antinous was sent to Rome to be trained as a page to serve the emperor and only gradually rose to the status of imperial favourite.Royston Lambert, pp. 60–1 The actual history of their relationship is mostly unknown.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 171\n\nWith or without Antinous, Hadrian travelled through Anatolia. His route is unknown. Various traditions suggest his presence at particular locations; he is said to have founded a city within Mysia, Hadrianutherae, after a successful boar hunt, but this is debated. At about this time, plans to complete the Temple of Zeus in Cyzicus, begun by the kings of Pergamon, were put into practice. The temple received a colossal statue of Hadrian, and Cyzicus was made a regional centre for the Imperial cult (neocoros), sharing it with Pergamon, Smyrna, Ephesus and SardesAnthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 164–7 – something that offered the benefits of Imperial sponsorship of sacred games, attracting tourism, and stimulating private expenditure, as well as channelling intercity rivalry into a common acceptance of Roman rule.Boatwright, p. 136\n\nGreece (124–125)\n\nHadrian arrived in Greece during the autumn of 124, and participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries. He had a particular commitment to Athens, which had previously granted him citizenship and an archonate; at the Athenians' request, he revised their constitution – among other things, he added a new phyle (tribe), which was named after him.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 175–7 Hadrian combined active, hands-on interventions with cautious restraint. He refused to intervene in a local dispute between producers of olive oil and the Athenian Assembly and Council, who had imposed production quotas on oil producers;Kaja Harter-Uibopuu, \"Hadrian and the Athenian Oil Law\", in O.M.

Retrieved June 20, 2015 Generally Hadrian preferred that Greek notables, including priests of the Imperial cult, focus on more durable provisions, such as aqueducts and public fountains (nymphaea).Mark Golden, Greek Sport and Social Status, University of Texas Press, 2009, , p. 88 Athens was given two such fountains; another was given to Argos.Cynthia Kosso, Anne Scott, eds., The Nature and Function of Water, Baths, Bathing, and Hygiene from Antiquity Through the Renaissance. Leiden: Brill, 2009, , pp. 216f\n\nDuring the winter he toured the Peloponnese. His exact route is uncertain, but Pausanias describes temples built by Hadrian, and his statue – in heroic nudity – erected by the grateful citizens of EpidaurusAlexia Petsalis-Diomidis, Truly Beyond Wonders: Aelius Aristides and the Cult of Asklepios. OUP : 2010, , p. 171 in thanks to their \"restorer\". He was especially generous to Mantinea, where he restored the Temple of Poseidon Hippios; this supports the theory that Antinous was in fact already Hadrian's lover because of the strong link between Mantinea and Antinous's home in Bithynia.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 177–80 As this kinship between Mantinea and Bythinia was itself a mythological fiction of the kind used at the time for encouraging political alliances between polities, a more serious reason might exist for Hadrian's particular generosity.David S. Potter,The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180–395. London: Routledge, 2014, , p. 44 Hadrian's building programme favoured long-established religious centers. Besides the temple at Mantinea, Hadrian restored other ancient shrines in Abae, Argos – where he restored the Heraion – and Megara.Boatwright, p. 134 This was a way of gathering legitimacy to Roman imperial rule by associating it with the glories of classical Greece – something well in line with contemporary antiquarian taste in cultural matters.K. W. Arafat, Pausanias' Greece: Ancient Artists and Roman Rulers. Cambridge U. Press, 2004, , p. 162 Pausanias credits Hadrian with restoring to Mantinea its ancient, classical name. It had been named Antigoneia since Hellenistic times, in honour of the Macedonian King Antigonus III Doson.K. W. Arafat, p. 185\n \nDuring his tour of the Peloponnese, Hadrian persuaded the Spartan grandee Eurycles Herculanus – leader of the Euryclid family that had ruled Sparta since Augustus' day – to enter the Senate, alongside the Athenian grandee Herodes Atticus the Elder. The two aristocrats would be the first from \"Old Greece\" to enter the Roman Senate, as representatives of the two \"great powers\" of the Classical Age.Birley, [http://uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/116pdf/116209.pdf \"Hadrian and Greek Senators\"], Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 116 (1997), pp. 209–245. Retrieved July 23, 2015 This was an important step in overcoming Greek notables' reluctance to take part in Roman political life.Christol & Nony, p. 203 In March 125, Hadrian presided at the Athenian festival of Dionysia, wearing Athenian dress. He initiated a substantial public building program in and around Athens. The Temple of Olympian Zeus had been under construction for more than five centuries; Hadrian committed the vast resources at his command to ensure that the job would be finished. He also organised the planning and construction of a particularly challenging and ambitious aqueduct to bring water to the Athenian agora.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 182–4\n\nReturn to Italy and trip to Africa (126–128)\n\nOn his return to Italy, Hadrian made a detour to Sicily. Coins celebrate him as the restorer of the island.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 191–200 Back in Rome, he saw the rebuilt Pantheon, and his completed villa at nearby Tibur, among the Sabine Hills. In early March 127 Hadrian set off on a tour of Italy; his route has been reconstructed through the evidence of his gifts and donations. He restored the shrine of Cupra in Cupra Maritima, and improved the drainage of the Fucine lake. Less welcome than such largesse was his decision in 127 to divide Italy into four regions under imperial legates with consular rank, acting as governors. They were given jurisdiction over all of Italy, excluding Rome itself, therefore shifting cases from the courts of Rome.J. Declareuil, Rome the Law-Giver, London: Routledge, 2013, , p. 72 Having Italy effectively reduced to the status of a group of mere provinces did not go down well with the Roman Senate;Clifford Ando, Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000,  and the innovation did not long outlive Hadrian's reign.\n\nHadrian fell ill around this time; whatever the nature of his illness, it did not stop him from setting off in the spring of 128 to visit Africa. His arrival began with the good omen of rain ending a drought. Along with his usual role as benefactor and restorer, he found time to inspect the troops; his speech to them survives.Royston Lambert, pp. 71–2 Hadrian returned to Italy in the summer of 128 but his stay was brief, as he set off on another tour that would last three years.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 213–4\n\nGreece, Asia, and Egypt (128–130); Antinous's death\n\nIn September 128, Hadrian attended the Eleusinian mysteries again. This time his visit to Greece seems to have concentrated on Athens and Sparta – the two ancient rivals for dominance of Greece. Hadrian had played with the idea of focusing his Greek revival around the Amphictyonic League based in Delphi, but by now he had decided on something far grander. His new Panhellenion was going to be a council that would bring Greek cities together. Having set in motion the preparations – deciding whose claim to be a Greek city was genuine would take time – Hadrian set off for Ephesus.Anthony Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 215–20 From Greece, Hadrian proceeded by way of Asia to Egypt. It is known from an inscription that he was probably conveyed across the Aegean with his entourage by an Ephesian merchant, Lucius Erastus. Hadrian later sent a letter on Erastus' behalf to the Council of Ephesus, supporting his request to become a town councillor. Hadrian offered to pay the requisite fee for Erastus' council membership, as long as the Ephesians considered him worthy (as a merchant, he may well have been thought unworthy).Boatwright, p. 81\n\nIn Egypt, Hadrian opened his stay by restoring Pompey the Great's tomb at Pelusium.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 235 Hadrian also offered sacrifice to Pompey as a hero and composed an epigraph for the tomb. As Pompey was universally acknowledged as the conqueror of the Roman East, this restoration was probably linked to a need to reaffirm Roman Eastern hegemony after the recent disturbances there during Trajan's late reign.Boatwright, p. 142 Also in Egypt, a poem about a lion hunt in the Libyan desert by the Greek Pankrates witnesses for the first time that Antinous travelled alongside Hadrian.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 173\n\nIn October 130, while Hadrian and his entourage were sailing on the Nile, Antinous drowned. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are unknown, and accident, suicide, murder and religious sacrifice have all been postulated. Historia Augusta offers the following account:\n\nHadrian had Antinous deified as Osiris-Antinous by an Egyptian priest at the ancient Temple of Ramesses II, very near the place of his death. Hadrian dedicated a new temple-city complex there, built in a Graeco-Roman style, and named it Antinopolis.Cassius Dio, LIX.11; Historia Augusta, Hadrian It was a proper Greek polis; it was granted an Imperially subsidised alimentary scheme similar to Trajan's alimenta,Tim Cornell, Dr Kathryn Lomas, eds., Bread and Circuses: Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy. London: Routledge, 2003, , p. 97 and its citizens were allowed intermarriage with members of the native population, without loss of citizen-status. Hadrian thus identified an existing native cult (to Osiris) with Roman rule.Carl F. Petry, ed. The Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, 2008, , p. 15\n\nGreece and the East (130–132) \n\nHadrian's movements after the founding of Antinopolis on 30 October 130 are uncertain. Whether or not he returned to Rome, he travelled in the East during 130/131, to organise and inaugurate his new Panhellenion, which was to be focussed on the Athenian Temple to Olympian Zeus. Successful applications for membership involved mythologised or fabricated claims to Greek origins, and affirmations of loyalty to Imperial Rome, to satisfy Hadrian's personal, idealised notions of Hellenism.Boatwright, p. 150Anthony Kaldellis, Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical TraditionCambridge U. Press, 2008, , p. 38 Hadrian saw himself as protector of Greek culture and the \"liberties\" of Greece – in this case, urban self-government. It allowed Hadrian to appear as the fictive heir to Pericles, who supposedly had convened a previous Panhellenic Congress – such a Congress is mentioned only in Pericles' biography by Plutarch, whose sympathies to the Imperial order are well-known.Fernando A. Marín Valdés, Plutarco y el arte de la Atenas hegemónica. Universidad de Oviedo: 2008, , p. 76\n\nEpigraphical evidence suggests that the prospect of applying to the Panhellenion held little attraction to the wealthier, Hellenised cities of Asia Minor, which were jealous of Athenian and European Greek preeminence within Hadrian's scheme.A. J. S. Spawforth, Greece and the Augustan Cultural Revolution. Cambridge University Press: 2011, , p. 262 Hadrian's notion of Hellenism was narrow and deliberately archaising; he defined \"Greekness\" in terms of classical roots, rather than a broader, Hellenistic culture.Nathanael J. Andrade, Syrian Identity in the Greco-Roman World. Cambridge University Press, 2013, , p. 176 The German sociologist Georg Simmel remarked that the Panhellenion was based on \"games, commemorations, preservation of an ideal, an entirely non-political Hellenism\".Georg Simmel, Sociology: Inquiries into the Construction of Social Forms. Leiden: Brill, 2009, , p. 288\n\nThis third and last trip to the Greek East produced much religious enthusiasm in the region centred around Hadrian, who received a personal cult as a deity and many monuments and civic homages, according to the religious syncretism at the time.Marcel Le Glay. \"Hadrien et l'Asklépieion de Pergame\".

He may have planned to rebuild Jerusalem as a Roman colony – as Vespasian had done with Caesarea Maritima – with various honorific and fiscal privileges. The non-Roman population would have no obligation to participate in Roman religious rituals, but were expected to support the Roman imperial order; this is attested in Caesarea, where some Jews served in the Roman army during both the 66 and 132 rebellions.Giovanni Battista Bazzana, \"The Bar Kokhba Revolt and Hadrian's religious policy\", IN Marco Rizzi, ed.,  Hadrian and the Christians. Berlim: De Gruyter, 2010, , pages 89/91 It has been speculated that Hadrian intended to assimilate the Jewish Temple to the traditional Roman civic-religious Imperial cult; such assimilations had long been commonplace practise in Greece and in other provinces, and on the whole, had been successful.Bazzana, 98Cf a project devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo: see Rizzi, Hadrian and the Christians, 4 The neighbouring Samaritans had already integrated their religious rites with Hellenistic ones.Emmanuel Friedheim, \"Some notes about the Samaritans and the Rabbinic Class at Crossroads\" IN Menachem Mor, Friedrich V.

Bloomington: iUniverse, 2013,  \n\nA tradition based on the Historia Augusta suggests that the revolt was spurred by Hadrian's abolition of circumcision (brit milah); which as a Hellenist he viewed as mutilation.Mackay, Christopher. Ancient Rome a Military and Political History: 230 The scholar Peter Schäfer maintains that there is no evidence for this claim, given the notoriously problematical nature of the Historia Augusta as a source, the \"tomfoolery\" shown by the writer in the relevant passage, and the fact that contemporary Roman legislation on \"genital mutilation\" seems to address the general issue of castration of slaves by their masters.Peter Schäfer, The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered: New Perspectives on the Second Jewish Revolt Against Rome  Mohr Siebeck, 2003 p. 68Peter Schäfer, The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World: The Jews of Palestine from Alexander the Great to the Arab Conquest.

Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press,2014, , pp. 25–26 \n\nThe Romans were overwhelmed by the organised ferocity of the uprising.Peter Schäfer,  Der Bar Kokhba-Aufstand, Tübingen 1981, pp. 29–50 Hadrian called his general Sextus Julius Severus from Britain, and brought troops in from as far as the Danube. Roman losses were heavy; an entire legion or its numeric equivalent of around 4,000.Possibly the XXII Deiotariana, which according to epigraphy did not outlast Hadrian's reign; see [http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/xxii_deiotariana.html livius.org account; however, Peter Schäfer, following Bowersock, finds no traces in the written sources of the purported annihilation of Legio XXII. A loss of such magnitude would have surely been mentioned (Der Bar Kokhba-Aufstand, 14). Hadrian's report on the war to the Roman Senate omitted the customary salutation, \"If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the legions are in health.\"Cassius Dio 69, 14.3 The rebellion was quashed by 135. According to Cassius Dio, Roman war operations in Judea left some 580,000 Jews dead, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed. An unknown proportion of the population was enslaved. Beitar, a fortified city 10 km southwest of Jerusalem, fell after a three and a half year siege. The extent of punitive measures against the Jewish population remains a matter of debate.Daniel R. Schwartz, Zeev Weiss, eds., Was 70 CE a Watershed in Jewish History?: On Jews and Judaism before and after the Destruction of the Second Temple. Leiden: Brill, 2011, , page 529, footnote 42\n\nHadrian erased the province's name from the Roman map, renaming it Syria Palaestina. He renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina after himself and Jupiter Capitolinus, and had it rebuilt in Greek style. According to Epiphanius, Hadrian appointed Aquila from Sinope in Pontus as \"overseer of the work of building the city\", since he was related to him by marriage.Epiphanius, Treatise on Weights and Measures – Syriac Version (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press, c1935, p. 30 Hadrian is said to have placed the city's main Forum at the junction of the main Cardo and Decumanus Maximus, now the location for the (smaller) Muristan. After the suppression of the Jewish revolt, Hadrian provided the Samaritans with a temple, dedicated to Zeus Hypsistos (\"Highest Zeus\")Ken Dowden, Zeus.

He then returned to Rome, probably in that year and almost certainly – judging from inscriptions – via Illyricum.Ronald Syme, \"Journeys of Hadrian\" (1988), pp. 164–9\n\nFinal years\n\nHadrian spent the final years of his life at Rome. In 134, he took an Imperial salutation for the end of the Second Jewish War (which was not actually concluded until the following year). Commemorations and achievement awards were kept to a minimum, as Hadrian came to see the war  \"as a cruel and sudden disappointment to his aspirations\" towards a cosmopolitan empire.Ronald Syme, \"Journeys Of Hadrian\".

In 136, he dedicated a new Temple of Venus and Roma on the former site of Nero's Golden House. The temple was the largest in Rome, and was built in an Hellenising style, more Greek than Roman. The temple's dedication and statuary associated the worship of the traditional Roman goddess Venus, divine ancestress and protector of the Roman people, with the worship of the goddess Roma – herself a Greek invention, hitherto worshiped only in the provinces – to emphasise the universal nature of the empire.Mellor, R., \"The Goddess Roma\" in Haase, W., Temporini, H., (eds), Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt, de Gruyter, 1991, , pp. 960-964\n\nThe Empress Sabina died probably in 136, after an unhappy marriage with which Hadrian had coped as a political necessity. The Historia Augusta biography states that Hadrian himself declared that his wife's \"ill-temper and irritability\" would be reason enough for a divorce, were he a private citizen.Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 10.3 That gave credence, after Sabina's death, to the common belief that Hadrian had her poisoned.Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian, 23.9 As befitted Hadrian's dynastic legitimacy, Sabina – who had been made an Augusta sometime around 128Anne Kolb, Augustae.

Press: 2015, , pages 140/142 \nArranging the succession\n\nHadrian's marriage to Sabina had been childless. Suffering from poor health, Hadrian turned to the problem of the succession. In 136 he adopted one of the ordinary consuls of that year, Lucius Ceionius Commodus, who as an emperor-in waiting took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar. He was the son-in-law of Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, one of the \"four consulars\" executed in 118, but was himself in delicate health, apparently with a reputation more \"of a voluptuous, well educated great lord than that of a leader\".Merlin Alfred.

Various modern attempts have been made to explain Hadrian's choice: Jerome Carcopino proposes that Aelius was Hadrian's natural son.Albino Garzetti, From Tiberius to the Antonines : A History of the Roman Empire AD 14–192. London: Routledge, 2014, p. 699 It has also been speculated that his adoption was Hadrian's belated attempt to reconcile with one of the most important of the four senatorial families whose leading members had been executed soon after Hadrian's succession. Aelius acquitted himself honourably as joint governor of Pannonia Superior and Pannonia Inferior;András Mócsy, Pannonia and Upper Moesia (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire. London: Routledge, 2014, , p. 102 he held a further consulship in 137, but died on 1 January 138.Anthony Birley, pp. 289–292.\n\nHadrian next adopted Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus (the future emperor Antoninus Pius), who had served Hadrian as one of the five imperial legates of Italy, and as proconsul of Asia. In the interests of dynastic stability, Hadrian required that Antoninus adopt both Lucius Ceionius Commodus (son of the deceased Aelius Caesar) and Marcus Annius Verus (grandson of an influential senator of the same name who had been Hadrian's close friend; Annius was already betrothed to Aelius Caesar's daughter Ceionia Fabia;The adoptions: Anthony Birley, pp. 294–5; T.D. Barnes, 'Hadrian and Lucius Verus', Journal of Roman Studies (1967), Ronald Syme, Tacitus, p. 601. Antoninus as a legate of Italy: Anthony Birley, p. 199Annius Verus was also\nthe step-grandson of the Prefect of Rome, Lucius Catilius Severus, one of the remnants of the all-powerful group of Spanish senators from Trajan's reign. Hadrian would likely have shown some favor to the grandson in order to count on the grandfather's support; for an account of the various familial and marital alliances involved, see Des Boscs-Plateaux, pp. 241, 311, 477, 577; see also Frank McLynn,Marcus Aurelius: A Life. New York: Da Capo, 2010, , p. 84 It may not have been Hadrian, but rather Antoninus Pius – Annius Verus's uncle – who supported Annius Verus' advancement; the latter's divorce of Ceionia Fabia and subsequent marriage to Antoninus' daughter Annia Faustina points in the same direction. When he eventually became Emperor, Marcus Aurelius would co-opt Ceionius Commodus as his co-Emperor, under the name of Lucius Verus, on his own initiative. \n\nHadrian's last few years were marked by conflict and unhappiness. His adoption of Aelius Caesar proved unpopular, not least with Hadrian's brother-in-law Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus and Servianus's grandson Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator. Servianus, though now far too old, had stood in the line of succession at the beginning of Hadrian's reign; Fuscus is said to have had designs on the imperial power for himself. In 137 he may have attempted a coup in which his grandfather was implicated; Hadrian ordered that both be put to death.Anthony Birley, pp. 291–2 Servianus is reported to have prayed before his execution that Hadrian would \"long for death but be unable to die\".Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#17.2 69.17.2] During his final, protracted illness, Hadrian was prevented from suicide on several occasions.Anthony Birley, p. 297\n\nDeath\n\nHadrian died in the year 138 on the 10th of July, in his villa at Baiae at the age of 62. The cause of death is believed to have been heart failure. Dio Cassius and the Historia Augusta record details of his failing health. He had reigned for 21 years, the longest since Tiberius, and the fourth longest in the Principate, after Augustus, Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius, and Tiberius.\n\nHe was buried first at Puteoli, near Baiae, on an estate that had once belonged to Cicero. Soon after, his remains were transferred to Rome and buried in the Gardens of Domitia, close by the almost-complete mausoleum. Upon completion of the Tomb of Hadrian in Rome in 139 by his successor Antoninus Pius, his body was cremated, and his ashes were placed there together with those of his wife Vibia Sabina and his first adopted son, Lucius Aelius, who also died in 138. After threatening the Senate – which toyed with refusing Hadrian's divine honours – by refusing to assume power himself,Salmon, 816 Antoninus eventually succeeded in having his predecessor deifiedDio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/70*.html#1.1 70.1.1] in 139 and given a temple on the Campus Martius, ornamented with reliefs representing the provinces.Samuel Ball Platner, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome. Cambridge University Press: 2015, , page 250 The Senate awarded Antoninus the title of \"Pius\", in recognition of his filial piety in pressing for the deification of his adoptive father. At the same time, perhaps in reflection of the senate's ill will towards Hadrian, commemorative coinage honouring his consecration was kept to a minimum.Christian Bechtold, Gott und Gestirn als Präsenzformen des toten Kaisers: Apotheose und Katasterismos in der politischen Kommunikation der römischen Kaiserzeit und ihre Anknüpfungspunkte im Hellenismus.V&R unipress GmbH: 2011, , p. 259\n\nMilitary\n\nMost of Hadrian's military activities were consistent with his ideology of Empire as a community of mutual interest and support. He focussed on protection from external and internal threats; on \"raising up\" existing provinces, rather than the aggressive acquisition of wealth and territory through subjugation of \"foreign\" peoples that had characterised the early Empire.Clifford Ando, Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000, , p. 330 While the empire as a whole benefited from this, military careerists resented the loss of opportunities.   \n\nHadrian sought to surround the empire with stable, sustainable borders, and employed a variety of means to deal with potential and actual threats to the Empire's integrity. The 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor charged him with jealous belittlement of Trajan's achievements (Traiani gloriae invidens), abandoning the latter's conquests in Mesopotamia.W. Den Boer, Some Minor Roman Historians, Leiden: Brill, 1972, , p. 41 More likely, an expansionist policy was no longer realistic; the Empire had lost two legions, the Legio XXII Deiotariana and the \"lost legion\" IX Hispania, possibly destroyed in a late Trajanic uprising by the Brigantes in Britain.Yann Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army. London: Routledge, 2013, , p. 55 Trajan himself may have thought his gains in Mesopotamian indefensible, and abandoned them shortly before his death.Albino Garzetti, From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192. London: Routledge, 2014, , p. 381. Hadrian granted parts of Dacia to the Roxolani Sarmatians; their king Rasparaganus received Roman citizenship, client king status, and possibly an increased subsidy.This partial withdrawal was probably supervised by the governor of Moesia Quintus Pompeius Falco; see Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 84 & 86. Hadrian's presence on the Dacian front at this time is mere conjecture; but Dacia was included in his coin series with allegories of the provinces.Eutropius' notion that Hadrian contemplated withdrawing from Dacia altogether appears to be unfounded; see Jocelyn M. C. Toynbee, The Hadrianic School: A Chapter in the History of Greek Art. CUP Archive, 1934, 79 A controlled, partial withdrawal from the Dacian plains would have been less costly than maintaining several Roman cavalry units and a supporting network of fortifications.Julian Bennett, Trajan-Optimus Priceps. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001, , p. 165\n\nHadrian retained control over Osroene through the client king Parthamaspates, who had once served as Trajan's client king of Parthia;Opper, Empire and Conflict, p. 67 and around 121, Hadrian negotiated a peace treaty with the now-independent Parthia. Late in his reign (135), the Alani attacked Roman Cappadocia with the covert support of Pharasmanes, king of Caucasian Iberia. The attack was repulsed by Hadrian's governor, the historian Arrian,N. J. E. Austin & N. B. Rankov, Exploratio: Military & Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 4 who subsequently installed a Roman \"adviser\" in Iberia.Austin & Rankov, p. 30 Arrian kept Hadrian well-informed On all questions related to the Black Sea and the Caucasus. Between 131 and 132 he sent Hadrian a lengthy letter (Periplus of the Euxine) on a maritime trip around the Black Sea, intended to offer relevant information in case a Roman intervention was needed.Fergus Millar, Rome, the Greek World, and the East: Volume 2: Government, Society, and Culture in the Roman Empire. The University of North Carolina Press, 2005, , p. 183\n\nHadrian also developed permanent fortifications and military posts along the empire's borders (limites, sl. limes) to support his policy of stability, peace and preparedness. This helped keep the military usefully occupied in times of peace; his Wall across Britania was built by ordinary troops. A series of mostly wooden fortifications, forts, outposts and watchtowers strengthened the Danube and Rhine borders. Troops practised intensive, regular drill routines. Although his coins showed military images almost as often as peaceful ones, Hadrian's policy was peace through strength, even threat,Elizabeth Speller, p. 69 with an emphasis on disciplina (discipline), which was the subject of two monetary series. Cassius Dio praised Hadrian's emphasis on \"spit and polish\" as cause for the generally peaceful character of his reign.Opper, p. 85 Fronto expressed other opinions on the subject. In his view, Hadrian preferred war games  to actual war, and enjoyed \"giving eloquent speeches to the armies\" – like the inscribed series of addresses he made while on an inspection tour, during 128, at the new headquarters of Legio III Augusta in LambaesisBirley, Restless Emperor, pp. 209-212\n\nFaced with a shortage of legionary recruits from Italy and other Romanised provinces, Hadrian systematised the use of less costly numeri – ethnic non-citizen troops with special weapons, such as Eastern mounted archers – in low-intensity, mobile defensive tasks such as dealing with border infiltrators and skirmishers.Luttvak, Edward N. The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979, , p. 123Christol & Nony, p. 180 Hadrian is also credited with introducing units of heavy cavalry (cataphracts) into the Roman army. Fronto later blamed Hadrian for declining standards in the Roman army of his own time.Fronto: Selected Letters. Edited by Caillan Davenport & Jenifer Manley, London: AC & Black, 2014, , pp. 184f\n\nLegal and social\n\nHadrian enacted, through the jurist Salvius Julianus, the first attempt to codify Roman law. This was the Perpetual Edict, according to which the legal actions of praetors became fixed statutes, and as such could no longer be subjected to personal interpretation or change by any magistrate other than the Emperor.Laura Jansen, The Roman Paratext: Frame, Texts, Readers, Cambridge University Press, 2014,  p. 66Kathleen Kuiper (Editor), Ancient Rome: From Romulus and Remus to the Visigoth Invasion, New York: Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010,  p. 133 At the same time, following a procedure initiated by Domitian, Hadrian made the Emperor's legal advisory board, the consilia principis (\"council of the princeps\") into a permanent body, staffed by salaried legal aides.A. Arthur Schiller, Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development, Walter de Gruyter: 1978,  p. 471 Its members were mostly drawn from the equestrian class, replacing the earlier freedmen of the Imperial household.Salmon, 812R.V. Nind Hopkins, Life of Alexander Severus, CUP Archive, p. 110 This innovation marked the superseding of surviving Republican institutions by an openly autocratic political system.Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, Volume 43, Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1968,  p. 650 The reformed bureaucracy was supposed to exercise administrative functions independently of traditional magistracies; objectively it did not detract from the Senate's position. The new civil servants were free men and as such supposed to act on behalf of the interests of the \"Crown\", not of the Emperor as an individual. However, the Senate never accepted the loss of its prestige caused by the emergence of a new aristocracy alongside it, placing more strain on the already troubled relationship between the Senate and the Emperor.Salmon, 813\n\nHadrian codified the customary legal privileges of the wealthiest, most influential or highest status citizens (described as splendidiores personae or honestiores), who held a traditional right to pay fines when found guilty of relatively minor, non-treasonous offences. Low ranking persons - alii (\"the others\"), including low-ranking citizens - were humiliores who for the same offences could be subject to extreme physical punishments, including forced labour in the mines or in public works, as a form of fixed-term servitude. While Republican citizenship had carried at least notional equality under law, and the right to justice, offences in Imperial courts were judged and punished according to the relative prestige, rank, reputation and moral worth of both parties; senatorial courts were apt to be lenient when trying one of their peers, and to deal very harshly with offences committed against one of their number by low ranking citizens or non-citizens. For treason (maiestas) beheading was the worst punishment that the law could inflict on honestiores; the humiliores might suffer crucifixion, burning, or condemnation to the beasts in the arena.Garnsey, Peter, \"Legal Privilege in the Roman Empire\", Past & Present, No. 41 (Dec., 1968), pp. 9, 13 (note 35), 16, published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/650001 (accessed: 03-12-2017 21:20 UTC) \n\nA great number of Roman citizens maintained a precarious social and economic advantage at the lower end of the hierarchy. Hadrian found it necessary to clarify that decurions, the usually middle-class, elected local officials responsible for running the ordinary, everyday official business of the provinces, counted as honestiores; so did soldiers, veterans and their families, as far as civil law was concerned; by implication, all others, including freedmen and slaves, counted as humliores. Like most Romans, Hadrian seems to have accepted slavery as morally correct, an expression of the same natural order that rewarded \"the best men\" with wealth, power and respect. When confronted by a crowd demanding the freeing of a popular slave charioteer, Hadrian replied that he could not free a slave belonging to another person.Westermann, 109 However, he limited the punishments that slaves could suffer; they could be lawfully tortured to provide evidence, but they could not be lawfully killed unless guilty of a capital offence.Marcel Morabito, Les realités de l'esclavage d'après Le Digeste. Paris: Presses Univ. Franche-C omté, 1981, , p. 230 Masters were also forbidden to sell slaves to a gladiator trainer (lanista) or to a procurer, except as legally justified punishment.Donald G. Kyle, Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome. London: Routledge, 2012, ;William Linn Westermann, The Slave Systems of Greek and Roman Antiquity. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1955, p. 115 Hadrian also forbade torture of free defendants and witnesses.Digest 48.18.21; quoted by Q.F. Robinson, Penal Practice and Penal Policy in Ancient Rome. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, p.107Judith Perkins, Roman Imperial Identities in the Early Christian Era. Abingdon: Routledge, 2009,  He abolished ergastula, private prisons for slaves in which kidnapped free men had sometimes been illegally detained.Christopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order. Oxford University Press, 2012, , p. 102\n\nHadrian issued a general rescript, imposing a ban on castration, performed on freeman or slave, voluntarily or not, on pain of death for both the performer and the patient.Digest, 48.8.4.2, quoted by Paul Du Plessis, Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law. Oxford University Press, 2015, , p. 95 Under the Lex Cornelia de Sicaris et Veneficis, castration was place on a par with conspiracy to murder, and punished accordingly.Peter Schäfer, Judeophobia, 104. Notwithstanding his philhellenism, Hadrian was also a traditionalist. He enforced dress-standards among the honestiores; senators and knights were expected to wear the  toga when in public. He imposed strict separation between the sexes in theaters and public baths; to discourage idleness, the latter were not allowed to open until 2.00 in the afternoon, \"except for medical reasons\".Garzetti, p. 411\n\nReligious\n\nImperial cult\n\nOne of Hadrian's immediate duties on accession was to seek senatorial consent for the apotheosis of his predecessor, Trajan, and any members of Trajan's family to whom he owed a debt of gratitude. During his return from Brittania, Hadrian may have stopped at Nemausus, to oversee the completion of foundation of a basilica dedicated to his patroness Plotina, who had recently died in Rome and had been deified at Hadrian's request.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 145 Shortly before Plotina's death, Hadrian had granted her wish that the leadership of the Epicurean School in Athens be open to a non-Roman candidate.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 108f Matidia Augusta, Hadrian's mother-in-law, had died earlier, in December 119, and had also been deified.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 107\n\nAs Emperor, Hadrian was also Rome's pontifex maximus, responsible for all religious affairs and the proper functioning of official religious institutions throughout the empire. His Hispano-Roman origins and marked pro-Hellenism shifted the focus of the official imperial cult, from Rome to the Provinces. While his standard coin issues still identified him with the traditional genius populi Romani, other issues stressed his personal identification with Hercules Gaditanus (Hercules of Gades), and Rome's imperial protection of Greek civilisation.Gradel, Ittai, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002. , pp. 194-5. He promoted Sagalassos in Greek Pisidia as the Empire's leading Imperial cult centre; his exclusively Greek Panhellenion extolled Athens as the spiritual centre of Greek culture.Howgego, in Howgego, C., Heuchert, V., Burnett, A., (eds), Coinage and Identity in the Roman Provinces, Oxford University Press, 2005. , pp. 6, 10.\n\nAntinous\n\nHadrian was criticized for the open intensity of his grief at Antinous's death, particularly as he had delayed the apotheosis of his own sister Paulina after her death.Hadrian's \"Hellenic\" emotionalism finds a culturally sympathetic echo in the Homeric Achilles' mourning for his friend Patroclus: see discussion in Vout, Caroline, Power and eroticism in Imperial Rome, illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 2007. , pp. 52–135. But his attempt at turning the deceased youth into a cult-figure found little opposition.Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality : Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity. Oxford University Press: 1999, , pp. 60f The cult of Antinous was to become very popular in the Greek-speaking world, and also found support in the West. In Hadrian's villa, statues of the Tyrannicides, with a bearded Aristogeiton and a clean-shaven Harmodios, linked his favourite to the classical tradition of Greek loveElsner, pp. 176f Antinous was also compared to the Celtic sun-god Belenos.Williams, p. 61\n\nMedals were struck with Antinous's effigy, and statues erected to him in all parts of the empire, in all kinds of garb, including Egyptian dress.Jás Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, Oxford History of Art, Oxford U.P., 1998, , p. 183f. Temples were built for his worship in Bithynia and Mantineia in Arcadia. In Athens, festivals were celebrated in his honour and oracles delivered in his name.  Antinous was not part of the state-sponsored, official Roman imperial cult, but provided a common focus for the emperor and his subjects, emphasizing their sense of community.Marco Rizzi, p. 12 As an \"international\" cult figure, Antinous had an enduring fame, far outlasting Hadrian's reign.see Trevor W. Thompson [https://www.academia.edu/9076863/Antinoos_The_New_God_Origen_on_Miracle_and_Belief_in_Third-Century_Egypt \"Antinoos, The New God: Origen on Miracle and Belief in Third Century Egypt\"] for the persistence of Antinous's cult and Christian reactions to it. Freely available. The relationship of P. Oxy. 63.4352 with Diocletian's accession is not entirely clear. Local coins with his effigy were still being struck during Caracalla's reign, and he was invoked in a poem to celebrate the accession of Diocletian.Caroline Vout, Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome. Cambridge University Press; 2007, p. 89\n\nChristians\n\nHadrian continued Trajan's policy on Christians; they should not be sought out, and should only be prosecuted for specific offences, such as refusal to swear oaths.Birley, Restless Emperor, pp. 127 and 183. In a rescript addressed to the proconsul of Asia Minutius Fundanus and preserved by Justin Martyr, Hadrian laid down that accusers of Christians had to bear the burden of proof for their denunciationsAlessandro Galimberti, \"Hadrian, Eleusis, and the beginnings of Christian apologetics\" in Marco Rizzi, ed., Hadrian and the Christians.

Plymouth: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010, , p. 16\n\nPersonal and cultural interests\n\nHadrian had an abiding and enthusiastic interest in art, architecture and public works. Rome's Pantheon (temple \"to all the gods\"), originally built by Agrippa and destroyed by fire in 80, was partly restored under Trajan and completed under Hadrian in the domed form it retains to this day. Hadrian's Villa at Tibur (Tivoli) provides the greatest Roman equivalent of an Alexandrian garden, complete with domed Serapeum, recreating a sacred landscape.It was lost in large part to despoliation by the Cardinal d'Este, who had much of the marble removed to build the Villa d'Este in the 16th century. An epitome of Cassius Dio provides an anecdote that suggests Hadrian had a high opinion of his own architectural tastes and talents, and took their rejection as a personal offense: at some time before his reign, his predecessor Trajan was discussing an architectural problem with Apollodorus of Damascus - architect and designer of Trajan's Forum, the Column commemorating his Dacian conquest, and his bridge across the Danube - when Hadrian interrupted to offer his advice. Apollodorus gave him a scathing response: \"Be off, and draw your gourds [a sarcastic reference to the domes which Hadrian apparently liked to draw]. You don't understand any of these matters. Dio also claims that once Hadrian became emperor, he showed Apollodorus drawings of the gigantic Temple of Venus and Roma, implying that great buildings could be created without his help. When Apollodorus pointed out the building's various insoluble problems and faults, Hadrian was enraged, sent him into exile,and later put him to death on trumped up charges.Brickstamps with consular dates show that the Pantheon's dome was late in Trajan's reign (115), probably under Apollodorus's supervision: see Ilan Vit-Suzan, Architectural Heritage Revisited: A Holistic Engagement of its Tangible and Intangible Constituents , Farnham: Ashgate, 2014, , p. 20Cassius Dio, \"Roman History\", 69.4, Loeb Classical Library edition, 1925[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/69*.html]\n\nHadrian wrote poetry in both Latin and Greek; one of the few surviving examples is a Latin poem he reportedly composed on his deathbed (see below). Some of his Greek productions found their way into the Palatine Anthology.Juan Gil & Sofía Torallas Tovar, Hadrianus. Barcelona: CSIC, 2010, , p. 100Direct links to Hadrian's poems in the A.P. with W.R. Paton's translation at the Internet Archive \n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology01pato#page/474/mode/2up VI 332],\n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology00patogoog#page/n375/mode/2up VII 674], \n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology03pato#page/70/mode/2up IX 137],\n[https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology03pato#page/216/mode/2up IX 387] He also wrote an autobiography, which Historia Augusta says was published under the name of Hadrian's freedman Phlegon of Tralles. It was not, apparently, a work of great length or revelation, but designed to scotch various rumours or explain Hadrian's most controversial actions.T. J. Cornell, ed., The Fragments of the Roman Historians. Oxford University Press: 2013, p. 591 It is possible that this autobiography had the form of a series of open letters to Antoninus Pius.Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 26\n\nAccording to one source, Hadrian was a passionate hunter from a young age.Historia Augusta, Hadrian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2 2.1]. In northwest Asia, he founded and dedicated a city to commemorate a she-bear he killed.Fox, Robin The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian Basic Books. 2006 p. 574 It is documented that in Egypt he and his beloved Antinous killed a lion. In Rome, eight reliefs featuring Hadrian in different stages of hunting decorate a building that began as a monument celebrating a kill.\n\nHadrian's philhellenism may have been one reason for his adoption, like Nero before him, of the beard as suited to Roman imperial dignity; Dio of Prusa had equated the growth of the beard with the Hellenic ethos.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 62. Hadrian's beard may also have served to conceal his natural facial blemishes.The Historia Augusta however claims that [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#26.1 \"he wore a full beard to cover up the natural blemishes on his face\"], H.A. 26.1 Most emperors before him had been clean-shaven; most who came after him were bearded, at least until Constantine the Great.\n\nHadrian was familiar with the Stoic philosophers Epictetus, and Favorinus, and with their works. During his first stay in Greece, before he became emperor, he attended lectures by Epictetus at Nicopolis.Robin Lane Fox, The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian. Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2006, , p.578\n\nDuring Hadrian's time as Tribune of the Plebs, omens and portents supposedly announced his future imperial condition.For instance, a probably bogus anecdote in Historia Augusta relates that as tribune he had lost a cloak that emperors never wore: Michael Reiche, ed., Antike Autobiographien: Werke, Epochen, Gattungen. Köln: Böhlau, 2005, , p.225 According to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian had a great interest in astrology and divination and had been told of his future accession to the Empire by a grand-uncle who was himself a skilled astrologer.Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Cornell University Press: 2007, , p. 177\n\nPoem by Hadrian\n\nAccording to the Historia Augusta, Hadrian composed the following poem shortly before his death:Historia Augusta, Hadrian Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#25.9 25.9]; Antony Birley, p. 301\n\nAnimula, vagula, blandula\nHospes comesque corporis\nQuae nunc abibis in loca\nPallidula, rigida, nudula,\nNec, ut soles, dabis iocos...\n\n::P. Aelius Hadrianus Imp.\n\nRoving amiable little soul,\nBody's companion and guest,\nNow descending for parts\nColourless, unbending, and bare\nYour usual distractions no more shall be there...\n\nThe poem has enjoyed remarkable popularity,see e.g.[http://coldewey.cc/post/17072720047/forty-three-translations-of-hadrians-animula Forty-three translations of Hadrian's \"Animula, vagula, blandula ...\" ]  including translations by Henry Vaughan, A.

S. Eliot's poem \"Animula\" may have been inspired by Hadrian's, though the relationship is not unambiguous.Russell E. Murphy, [https://books.google.ch/books?id\nthqU29nSVgUC&pgPA48#v\nonepage&q&f=false Critical Companion to T. S. Eliot: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work], 2007. p.48\n\nAppraisals\n\nHadrian has been described as the most versatile of all Roman emperors.Varius multiplex multiformis in the anonymous, ancient Epitome de Caesaribus, 14.6: cf Ronald Syme, among others; see Ando, footnote 172 Schiller called Hadrian \"the Empire's first servant\". Edward Gibbon admired his \"vast and active genius\" and his \"equity and moderation\". In 1776, he stated that Hadrian's era was part of the \"happiest era of human history\". In his Meditations, written during his reign as emperor, Marcus Aurelius lists those to whom he owes a debt of gratitude; Hadrian is conspicuously absent.McLynn, 42 Hadrian's tense, authoritarian relationship with his senate was acknowledged a generation after his death by Fronto, himself a senator, who wrote in one of his letters to Marcus Aurelius that \"I praised the deified Hadrian, your grandfather, in the senate on a number of occasions with great enthusiasm, and I did this willingly, too [...] But, if it can be said – respectfully acknowledging your devotion towards your grandfather – I wanted to appease and assuage Hadrian as I would Mars Gradivus or Dis Pater, rather than to love him.\"\"Wytse Keulen, Eloquence rules: the ambiguous image of Hadrian in Fronto's correspondence\". [http://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/literaryinteractions/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Eloquence-rules-working-paper1.pdf] Retrieved February 20, 2015 Fronto adds, in another letter, that he kept some friendships, during Hadrian's reign, \"under the risk of my life\" (cum periculo capitis).James Uden (2010). \"The Contest of Homer and Hesiod and the ambitions of Hadrian\". Journal of Hellenic Studies, 130 (2010), pp. 121-135.[https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/5437/uden_jhs_2010.pdf?sequence=1]. Accessed October 16, 2017 The veiled antagonism between Hadrian and the Senate never grew to overt confrontation as had happened during the reigns of overtly \"bad\" emperors, because Hadrian knew how to remain aloof and avoid an open clash.Paul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, p. 40 That Hadrian spent half of his reign away from Rome in constant travel undoubtedly helped the management of this strained relationship.Birley, Restless Emperor, p. 1\n\nThe Senate's political role was effaced behind Hadrian's personal rule (in Ronald Syme's view. Hadrian \"was a Führer, a Duce, a Caudillo\").Apud Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 65 Hadrian underscored the autocratic character of his reign by counting his dies imperii from the day of his acclamation by the armies, rather than the senate, and legislating by frequent use of imperial decrees to bypass the Senate's approval.Edward Togo Salmon,A History of the Roman World from 30 B.C. to A.D. 138. London: Routledge, 2004, , pp. 314f According to Syme, Tacitus' description of the rise and accession of Tiberius is a disguised account of Hadrian's authoritarian Principate.Victoria Emma Pagán, A Companion to Tacitus. Malden, MA: John Wiley & Sons, 2012, , page 1 According, again, to Syme, Tacitus' Annals would be a work of contemporary history, written \"during Hadrian's reign and hating it\".Marache, R.: R. Syme, Tacitus, 1958. In: Revue des Études Anciennes. Tome 61, 1959, n°1–2. pp. 202–206.available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1959_num_61_1_3617_t1_0202_0000_2]. Accessed April 30, 2017\n\nSources and historiography\n\nIn Hadrian's time, there was already a well established convention that one could not write a contemporary Roman imperial history for fear of contradicting what the emperors wanted to say, read or hear about themselves.Steven H. Rutledge, \"Writing Imperial Politics: The Social and Political Background\" IN William J. Dominik, ed;, Writing Politics in Imperial Rome Brill, 2009, , p.60Adam M. Kemezis, \"Lucian, Fronto, and the absence of contemporary historiography under the Antonines\". The American Journal of Philology Vol. 131, No. 2 (Summer 2010), pp. 285–325 Political histories of Hadrian's reign come mostly from later sources, some of them written centuries after the reign itself. Book69 of the early 3rd-century Roman History by Cassius Dio gives a general account of Hadrian's reign, but the original is lost; what survives is a brief, Byzantine-era abridgment by the 11th-century monk Xiphilinius, focussed on Hadrian's religious interests and the Bar Kokhba war, and little else. Hadrian's is the first in the series of probably late 4th-century imperial biographies known as Historia Augusta. The collection as a whole is notorious for its unreliability (\"a mish mash of actual fact, cloak and dagger, sword and sandal, with a sprinkling of Ubu Roi\"),Paul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain. Paris: Seuil, 2005, , p.312. In the French original: de l'Alexandre Dumas, du péplum et un peu d'Ubu Roi. but most modern historians consider its account of Hadrian to be relatively free of outright fictions, and probably based on sound historical sources.Danèel den Hengst, Emperors and Historiography: Collected Essays on the Literature of the Roman Empire. Leiden: Brill, 2010, , p. 93 Its principal source is generally assumed, on the basis of indirect evidence, to be one of a lost series of imperial biographies by the prominent 3rd-century senator Marius Maximus, covering the reigns of Nerva through to Elagabalus.Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds., The Cambridge Ancient History', XI: the High Empire, 70–192 A.D.Cambridge University Press, 2000, , p. 132 Greek authors such as Philostratus and Pausanias, who wrote shortly after Hadrian's reign, confined their scope to the general historical framework that shaped Hadrian's decisions, especially those relating to Greece. Fronto left Latin correspondence and works attesting to Hadrian's character and his reign's internal politics.Mary Taliaferro Boatwright, Hadrian and the Cities of the Roman Empire. Princeton University Press, 2002, pp.20/26 \n\nIn modern scholarship, these accounts are supplemented by epigraphical, numismatic, archaeological, and other non-literary sources, without which no detailed, chronological account would be possible; the first modern historian to attempt such an account was the German 19th-century medievalist Ferdinand Gregorovius.Anthony R Birley, Hadrian: The Restless Emperor. Abingdon: Routledge, 2013, , p.7Birley, Hadrian: the Restless Emperor, 7: Birley describes the results of Ernst Kornemann's attempt to sift the Historia Augusta biography's facts from its fictions (through textual analysis alone) as doubtful.\n\nGerman historian Wilhelm Weber produced a 1907 biography of Hadrian. Weber was an extreme German nationalist and later a Nazi Party supporter. In keeping with his general view on Roman history, his views on Hadrian, and especially the Bar Kokhba war, are ideologically loaded.Thomas E. Jenkins, Antiquity Now: The Classical World in the Contemporary American Imagination. Cambridge University Press: 2015, , paget121A'haron Oppenheimer, Between Rome and Babylon: Studies in Jewish Leadership and Society.Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005, , page 199 The 1923 Hadrian English biography by B.W. Henderson is more readable in the way of a summing-up and interpretation of the written sources, but Henderson's anti-German bias made him completely ignore Weber's study of the non-literary sources.\n\nOnly after the development of epigraphical studies in the post-war period could an alternate historiography of Hadrian develop, that leaned less on the ancient literary tradition. The ancient tradition had as its leitmotif a comparison between Hadrian and Trajan- mostly to the former's disadvantage. On the other hand, modern historiography on Hadrian sought to explore the meaning (as in the title of a recent summing-up work by the German historian Susanne Mortensen)Susanne Mortensen: Hadrian. Eine Deutungsgeschichte. Habelt, Bonn 2004,  attached by Hadrian to his policies on various fields, as well as the particular aspects of these policies. According to historians such as the Italian M.A. Levi, a summing-up of Hadrian's policies should stress the ecumenical character of the Empire, his development of an alternate bureaucracy disconnected from the Senate and adapted to the needs of an \"enlightened\" autocracy, as well as his overall defensive grand strategy. According to Levi, that would be enough to allow us to consider Hadrian as a grand Roman political reformer, the creator of an absolute monarchy in the place of a senatorial republic – even a sham one.Franco Sartori, \"L'oecuménisme d'un empereur souvent méconnu : [review of] M.A. Levi, Adriano, un ventennio di cambiamento\".

Retrieved January 19, 2017 British historian Robin Lane Fox, in his book about the Classical World, credits Hadrian with the creation of a unified Greco-Roman cultural tradition, but at the same time he considers Hadrian to be the end of this same tradition, as Hadrian's \"restoration\" of the Classical Age into the framework of an undemocratic Empire simply emptied it of substantive meaning, or, in Fox's words, \"kill[ed] it with kindness\".The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian. New York: Basic Books, 2006, , page 4 The latest (1997) English biography by Anthony Birley sums up and reflect these developments in Hadrian historiography.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations.
