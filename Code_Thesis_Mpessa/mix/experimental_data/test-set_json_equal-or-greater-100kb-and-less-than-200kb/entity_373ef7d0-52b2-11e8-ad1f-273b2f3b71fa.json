  "textBody" : "Macedonian (; , tr. makedonski,) is a South Slavic language spoken as a first language by around two million people, principally in the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. It is the official language of the Republic of Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.\n\nStandard Macedonian was implemented as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1945 and has since developed a modern literature. Most of the codification was formalized during the same period.Friedman, V. (1998) \"The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results\" in International Journal of the Sociology of Language, Vol. 131, pp. 31-57\n\nMacedonian dialects form a continuum with Bulgarian dialects; they in turn form a broader continuum with Serbo-Croatian through the transitional Torlakian dialects.\n\nThe name of the Macedonian language is a matter of political controversy in Greece and BulgariaMirjana N. Dedaić, Mirjana Misković-Luković. South Slavic discourse particles (John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2010), p. 13 as is its distinctiveness compared to Bulgarian in Bulgaria.Victor Roudometof. Collective memory, national identity, and ethnic conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian question (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002), p. 41[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu\n004&LangID=42 Language profile Macedonian], UCLA International Institute\n\nClassification and related languages\n\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the eastern group of the South Slavic branch of Slavic languages in the Indo-European language family, together with Bulgarian and the extinct Old Church Slavonic. Macedonian's closest relative is Bulgarian, with which it has a high degree of mutual intelligibility. The next closest relative is Serbo-Croatian. Language contact between Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian reached its height during Yugoslav times, when most Macedonians learned Serbo-Croatian as a compulsory language of education and knew and used Serbian (or \"pseudo-Serbian\", i.e. a mixture of Serbian and Macedonian).\n\nAll South Slavic languages, including Macedonian, form a dialect continuum. Macedonian, along with Bulgarian and Torlakian (transitional varieties of Serbo-Croatian), is also a part of the Balkan sprachbund, a group of languages that share typological, grammatical and lexical features based on geographical convergence, rather than genetic proximity. Its other principal members are Romanian, Greek and Albanian, all of which belong to different genetic branches of the Indo-European family (Romanian is a Romance language, whereas Greek and Albanian comprise separate branches). Macedonian and Bulgarian are sharply divergent from the remaining South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, and indeed all other Slavic languages, in that they do not use noun cases (except for the vocative, and apart from some traces of once productive inflections still found scattered throughout the languages) and have lost the infinitive. They are also the only Slavic languages with any definite articles (unlike standard Bulgarian, which uses only one article, standard Macedonian as well as some south-eastern Bulgarian dialects have a set of three based on an external frame of reference: unspecified, proximal and distal definite article). Bulgarian and Macedonian are the only Indo-European languages that make use of the narrative mood.\n\nPrior to the codification of the standard language (Standard Macedonian), Macedonian dialects were described by linguists as being either dialects of BulgarianMazon, André.

One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups, p.438 (Greenwood Press, 2000)Bernard Comrie. The Slavonic Languages, p.251 (Routledge, 1993). Similarly, Torlakian was also widely regarded as Bulgarian.  The boundaries between the South Slavic languages had yet to be \"conceptualized in modern terms,\"Joseph, Brian D. et al. When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Competition and Coexistence; Ohio State University Press (2002), p.261 and codifiers of Serbian even found it necessary to argue that Bulgarian was not a Serbian dialect as late as 1822. On the other hand, many Macedonian intellectuals maintained that their language \"was neither a dialect of Serbian nor of Bulgarian, but a language in its own right\".Max K. Adler. Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study; Buske Verlag (1980), p.215 Prior to the standardization of Macedonian, a number of linguists, among them Antoine Meillet,Antoine Meillet (French, linguist, 1928): Their dialects, differing among themselves, are not truly Serbian nor truly Bulgarian, especially if one is thinking of written Bulgarian, which is based on dialects quite far removed from the Macedonian dialects. In reality these dialects do not properly belong to either the one or the other of the two groups under dispute.1. Todor Dimitrovski, Blaže Koneski, Trajko Stamatoski.

Some linguists, including Otto KronsteinerKronsteiner, Otto, Der Zerfall Jugoslawiens und die Zukunft der makedonischen Literatursprache: Der späte Fall von Glottotomie? Herausgeber Schriftenreihe Die slawischen Sprachen, Erscheinungsjahr 1992, p. 142-171 and Michael Clyne,Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 9 especially in Bulgaria, still consider Macedonian a variety or dialect of Bulgarian, \"Macedonian is similar to Bulgarian and is sometimes been  regarded as a variety of that language. [...] Macedonian is spoken by about 200,000 people in Bulgaria, where it is viewed as a dialect of Bulgaria, and also in the province of Macedonia in northern Greece where the language is called Slavika. However, in the Republic of Macedonia, a separate Macedonian literary language has been in existence since 1944, and most scholars now accept Macedonian as a separate language. The Macedonian standard language is based on a difference group of dialects from the Bulgarian [...].\"R.E.Asher, J.M.Y.Simpson (editors), Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, (1994), vol.1, p.429: \"From a strictly linguistic point of view Macedonian can be called a Bulgarian dialect, as structurally it is most similar to Bulgarian. Indeed, Bulgarian scholars reject Macedonian as an individual language, but since it now has the status of a literary language, most other scholars accept its independent existence.\"Linguasphere 53-AAA-h but this view is politically controversial:\n\nAccording to Olga Mišeska–Tomić:\n\nModern questions of classification are largely shaped by political and social factors. Structurally, Macedonian, Bulgarian and southeastern forms of Serbo-Croatian (Torlakian) form a dialectical continuum that is a legacy of the linguistic developments during the height of the Preslav and Ohrid literary schools.Florin Curta. Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages; 500-1250. ; Cambridge. Pg 216\n\nAlthough it has been claimed that Standard Macedonian was codified on the base of those dialects (i.e. the Prilep-Bitola dialect) most unlike Bulgarian, this interpretation stems from the works of Krste Misirkov, who suggested that Standard Macedonian should abstract on those dialects \"most distinct from the standards of the other Slavonic languages\".Dedaić, Mirjana N. et al. South Slavic Discourse Particles; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13 Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian koiné language was already in existence.Bernard Comrie. The Slavonic Languages; Taylor & Francis (2002), p. 251 The codifiers ultimately chose the same dialects, but did so because they were \"most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers of other dialects.\"John Shea. Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation; McFarland (2008), p.208\n\nGeographical distribution\n\nThe population of the Republic of Macedonia was 2,022,547 in 2002, with 1,644,815 speaking Macedonian as their native language.Popis na Naselenie, Domaćinstva i Stanovi vo Republika Makedonija, 2002 - Vkupno naselenie na Republika Makedonija spored majčin jazik. Outside the Republic, there are Macedonians living in other parts of the geographical area of Macedonia. There are ethnic Macedonian minorities in neighbouring Albania, in Bulgaria, in Greece, and in Serbia. According to the official Albanian census of 1989, 4,697 ethnic Macedonians reside in Albania.\n\nA large number of Macedonians live outside the traditional Balkan Macedonian region, with Australia, Canada and the United States having the largest emigrant communities. According to a 1964 estimate, approximately 580,000 Macedonians live outside the Macedonian Republic, nearly 30% of the total population. The Macedonian language has the status of official language only in the Republic of Macedonia, and is a recognized minority and official language in parts of Albania (Pustec), Romania, and Serbia (Jabuka and Plandište). There are provisions for learning the Macedonian language in Romania as Macedonians are an officially recognized minority group. Macedonian is taught in some universities in Australia, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Russia, Serbia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.\n\nGreece\n\nThe varieties spoken by the Slavophone minority in parts of northern Greece, especially those in the Greek provinces of West and Central Macedonia, are today usually classified as part of the Macedonian language, with those in East Macedonia being transitional towards Bulgarian.Schmieger, R. 1998. \"The situation of the Macedonian language in Greece: sociolinguistic analysis\", International Journal of the Sociology of Language 131, 125–55.; Friedman (2001). Bulgarian linguistics traditionally regards them all as part of the Bulgarian language together with the rest of Macedonian.; Шклифов, Благой. Проблеми на българската диалектна и историческа фонетика с оглед на македонските говори, София 1995, с. 14.; Шклифов, Благой. Речник на костурския говор, Българска диалектология, София 1977, с. кн. VIII, с. 201–205, However, the codification of standard Macedonian has been in effect only in the Republic of Macedonia, and the Slavonic dialects spoken in Greece are thus practically \"roofless\", with their speakers having little access to standard or written Macedonian.\n\nMost of the language speakers in Greece do not identify ethnically as \"Macedonians\", but as ethnic Greeks (Slavophone Greeks) or dopii (locals). Therefore, the simple term \"Macedonian\" as a name for the Slavic language is often avoided in the Greek context, and vehemently rejected by most Greeks, for whom Macedonian has very different connotations. Instead, the language is often called simply \"Slavic\" or \"Slavomacedonian\", with \"Macedonian Slavic\" often being used in English. Speakers themselves variously refer to their language as makedonski, makedoniski (\"Macedonian\"),Lois Whitman (1994): Denying ethnic identity: The Macedonians of Greece Helsinki Human Rights Watch. p.39  slaviká (, \"Slavic\"), dópia or entópia (, \"local/indigenous [language]\"),  balgàrtzki in some parts of the region of Kastoria, bògartski (\"Bulgarian\") in some parts of Dolna Prespa[http://www.promacedonia.org/shklifovi/shklifovi_000_100.pdf Шклифов, Благой and Екатерина Шклифова, Български диалектни текстове от Егейска Македония, София 2003, с. 28-36, 172] - Shkifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova. Bulgarian dialect texts from Aegean Macedonia, Sofia 2003, p. 28-36, 172)  along with naši (\"our own\") and stariski (\"old\").Lois Whitman (1994): Denying ethnic identity: The Macedonians of Greece Helsinki Human Rights Watch. p.37  In Kastoria, however, the name \"Macedonian\" is used as well by the local people.\n\nThe exact number of speakers in Greece is difficult to ascertain, with estimates ranging between 20,000 and 250,000., See Page 90,\n Jacques Bacid estimates in his 1983 book that \"over 200,000 Macedonian speakers remained in Greece\".Jacques Bacid, Ph.D. Macedonia Through the Ages. Columbia University, 1983. Other sources put the numbers of speakers at 180,000 220,000 and 250,000, whereas Yugoslav sources vary, some putting the estimated number of \"Macedonians in Greek Macedonia\" at 150,000–200,000 and others at 300,000. The Encyclopædia Britannicahttp://www.britannica.com/new-multimedia/pdf/wordat077.pdf and the Reader's Digest World Guide both put the figure of ethnic Macedonians in Greece at 1.8% or c.200,000 people, with the native language roughly corresponding with the figures. The UCLA also states that there are 200,000 Macedonian speakers in Greece.[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID42&menu\n004 UCLA Language Materials Project: Language Profile] A 2008 article in the Greek newspaper Eleftherotypia put the estimate at 20,000.[http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c110,dt\n03.08.2008,id=62864592 Eleftherotypia article] \n\nThe largest group of speakers are concentrated in the Florina, Kastoria, Edessa, Giannitsa, Ptolemaida and Naousa regions. During the Greek Civil War, the codified Macedonian language was taught in 87 schools with 10,000 students in areas of northern Greece under the control of Communist-led forces, until their defeat by the National Army in 1949. In recent years, there have been attempts to have the language recognized as a minority language.\n\nRelationship to Bulgarian\n\nThe historical and linguistic relationships between the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages are special and complicated. Macedonian researchers claim Macedonian is spoken in southwestern Bulgaria, whereas Bulgarian and Greek linguists argue Macedonian is a variety of Bulgarian.\n\nThe rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire began to degrade its specific social system, and especially the so-called Rum millet, through constant identification of the religious creed with ethnicity. The national awakening of each ethnic group was complex and most of the groups interacted with each other.\n\nDuring the Bulgarian national revival, which occurred in the first half of the 19th century, the Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs under the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy wanted to create their own Church and schools which would use a common modern \"Macedono-Bulgarian\" literary standard, called simply Bulgarian. The national elites active in this movement used mainly ethnolinguistic principles to differentiation between \"Slavic-Bulgarian\" and \"Greek\" groups.From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870–1913. Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. At that time, every ethnographic subgroup in the Macedonian-Bulgarian linguistic area wrote in their own local dialect and choosing a \"base dialect\" for the new standard was not an issue. Subsequently, during the 1850s and 1860s a long discussion was held in the Bulgarian periodicals about the need for a dialectal group (eastern, western or compromise) upon which to base the new standard and which dialect that should be. During the 1870s this issue became contentious, and sparked fierce debates.Ц. Билярски, Из българския възрожденски печат от 70-те години на XIX в. за македонския въпрос, сп. \"Македонски преглед\", г. XXIII, София, 2009, кн. 4, с. 103-120.\n\nIn 1878, a distinct Bulgarian state was established. The new state did not include the region of Macedonia which remained outside its borders in the frame of the Ottoman Empire. As a consequence, the idea of a common compromise standard was rejected by the Bulgarian codifiers during the 1880s and the eastern Bulgarian dialects were chosen as a basis for standard Bulgarian. Macedono-Bulgarian writers and organizations who continued to seek greater representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian standard were deemed separatists.[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/003Friedman75.pdf \"Macedonian Language and Nationalism During the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries\"], Victor Friedman, p. 286, Victor Roudometof, Roland Robertson, p. 145\"Though Loza adhered to the Bulgarian position on the issue of the Macedonian Slavs' ethnicity, it also favored revising the Bulgarian orthography by bringing it closer to the dialects spoken in Macedonia.\" Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 241.The Young Macedonian Literary Association's Journal, Loza, was also categorical about the Bulgarian character of Macedonia: \"A mere comparison of those ethnographic features which characterize the Macedonians (we understand: Macedonian Bulgarians), with those which characterize the free Bulgarians, their juxtaposition with those principles for nationality which we have formulated above, is enough to prove and to convince everybody that the nationality of the Macedonians cannot be anything except Bulgarian.\" Freedom or Death, The Life of Gotsé Delchev, Mercia MacDermott, The Journeyman Press, London & West Nyack, 1978, p. 86.\"Macedonian historiography often refers to the group of young activists who founded in Sofia an association called the ‘Young Macedonian Literary Society’. In 1892, the latter began publishing the review Loza [The Vine], which promoted certain characteristics of Macedonian dialects. At the same time, the activists, called ‘Lozars’ after the name of their review, ‘purified’ the Bulgarian orthography from some rudiments of the Church Slavonic. They expressed likewise a kind of Macedonian patriotism attested already by the first issue of the review: its materials greatly emphasized identification with Macedonia as a genuine ‘fatherland’. In any case, it is hardly surprising that the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty: what is more interesting is namely the fact that their Bulgarian nationalism was somehow harmonized with a Macedonian self-identification that was not only a political one but also demonstrated certain ‘cultural’ contents. \"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe\", Diana Miškova, Central European University Press, 2009, , p. 120. One example is the Young Macedonian Literary Association, which the Bulgarian government outlawed in 1892. Though standard Bulgarian was taught in the local schools in Macedonia till 1913, the fact of political separation became crucial for the development of a separate Macedonian language.\n\nWith the advent of Macedonian nationalism, the idea of linguistic separatism emerged in the late 19th century, and the need for a separate Macedonian standard language subsequently appeared in the early 20th century. In the Interwar period, the territory of today's Republic of Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgarian was banned for use and the local vernacular fell under heavy influence from the official Serbo-Croatian language. However, the political and paramilitary organizations of the Macedonian Slavs in Europe and the Americas, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Macedonian Patriotic Organization (MPO), and even their left-wing offsets, the IMRO (United) and the Macedonian-American People's League continued to use literary Bulgarian in their writings and propaganda in the interbellum. During the World wars Bulgaria's short annexations over Macedonia saw two attempts to bring the Macedonian dialects back towards Bulgarian. This political situation stimulated the necessity of a separate Macedonian language and led gradually to its codification after the Second World War. It followed the establishment of SR Macedonia, as part of Communist Yugoslavia and finalized the\nprogressive split in the common Macedonian–Bulgarian language.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs shifted from predominantly Bulgarian to ethnic Macedonian and their regional identity had become their national one.\"Up until the early 20th century and beyond, the international community viewed Macedonians as a regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians.\" , .\"At the end of the WWI there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.\" , \"During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.\" , . Although, there was no clear separating line between these two languages on level of dialect then, the Macedonian standard was based on its westernmost dialects. Afterwards, Macedonian became the official language in the new republic, Serbo-Croatian was adopted as a second official language, and Bulgarian was proscribed. Moreover, in 1946-1948 the newly standardized Macedonian language was introduced as a second language even in Southwestern Bulgaria., . Subsequently, the sharp and continuous deterioration of the political relationships between the two countries, the influence of both standard languages during the time, but also the strong Serbo-Croatian linguistic influence in Yugoslav era, led to a horizontal cross-border dialectal divergence. Although some researchers have described the standard Macedonian and Bulgarian languages as varieties of a pluricentric language, they in fact have separate dialectal bases; the Prilep-Bitola dialect and Central Balkan dialect, respectively. The prevailing academic consensus (outside of Bulgaria and Greece) is that Macedonian and Bulgarian are two autonomous languages within the eastern subbranch of the South Slavic languages.Trudgill, Peter (1992), \"Ausbau sociolinguistics and the perception of language status in contemporary Europe\", International Journal of Applied Linguistics 2 (2): 167–177 Macedonian is thus an ausbau language; i.e. it is delimited from Bulgarian as these two standard languages have separate dialectal bases.Fishman, Joshua. \"Languages late to literacy: finding a place in the sun on a crowded beach\". In: Joseph, Brian D. et al. (ed.), When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Competition and Coexistence; Ohio State University Press (2002), pp. 107-108.\n\nUsage\n\nThe total number of Macedonian speakers is highly disputed. Although the precise number of speakers is unknown, figures of between 1.6 million (from [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mkd Ethnologue]) and 2–2.5 million have been cited; see  and . The general academic consensus is that there are approximately 2 million speakers of the Macedonian language, accepting that \"it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Macedonian due to the official policies of the neighbouring Balkan states and the fluid nature of emigration\" . According to the censuses and figures, the number of speakers of Macedonian is:\n\nDialects\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern and Western groups (the boundary runs approximately from Skopje and Skopska Crna Gora along the rivers Vardar and Crna). In addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the Proto-Slavic reduced vowels (yers), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *ǫ. That classification distinguishes between the following 5 groups:\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* Ohrid-Prespa Group\n** Ohrid dialect\n** Struga dialect\n** Vevčani-Radožda dialect\n** Upper Prespa dialect\n** Lower Prespa dialect.\n* Debar Group\n** Debar dialect\n** Reka dialect\n** Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect\n** Galičnik dialect\n** Skopska Crna Gora dialect\n** Gora dialect\n* Polog Group\n** Upper Polog dialect\n** Lower Polog dialect\n** Prilep-Bitola dialect\n** Kičevo-Poreče dialect\n** Skopje-Veles dialect\n* Kostur-Korča Group\n** Korča dialect\n** Kostur dialect\n** Nestram-Kostenar dialect\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* Northern Group\n** Kumanovo dialect\n** Kratovo dialect\n** Kriva Palanka dialect\n** Ovče Pole dialect\n* Eastern Group\n** Štip - Kočani dialect\n** Strumica dialect\n** Tikveš-Mariovo dialect\n** Maleševo-Pirin dialect\n** Solun-Voden dialect\n** Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect.\n\nThe Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect and Maleševo-Pirin dialect are also considered Bulgarian dialects.\n\nPhonology\n\nThis discusses the phonological system of Standard Macedonian (unless otherwise noted) based on the Prilep-Bitola dialect.  For discussion of other dialects, see Macedonian dialects. Macedonian possesses five vowels, one semivowel, three liquid consonants, three nasal stops, three pairs of fricatives, two pairs of affricates, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of stops.\n\nVowels\n\nSchwa\nThe schwa is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to or) but its use in the standard language is marginal. When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an apostrophe is used; for example, , , etc. When spelling aloud, each consonant is followed by the schwa. The individual letters of acronyms are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: . The lexicalized acronyms  and  (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions.\n\nVowel length\nVowel length is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penult can be realized as long, e.g.  'Veles'. The sequence is often realized phonetically as; e.g.  colloq. hour'.\n\nConsonants\n\n The alveolar trill is syllabic between two consonants; for example,  'finger'. The dental nasal and dental lateral are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g.  'newton',   'Popocatépetl', etc.\n\nThe labiodental nasal occurs as an allophone of before and (e.g.  'tram'). The velar nasal similarly occur as an allophone of before and (e.g.  'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\nPhonological processes\n\nAt morpheme boundaries (represented in spelling) and at the end of a word (not represented in spelling), voicing opposition is neutralized.\n\nStress\n\nThe word stress in Macedonian is antepenultimate, meaning it falls on the third from last syllable in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source. The following rules apply:\n* Disyllabic words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable.\n\nFor example,  'child',  'mother' and  'father'.\n* Trisyllabic and polysyllabic words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable.\n\nFor example,  'mountain',  'the mountain' and  'the mountaineers'.\n\nExceptions include:\n* Verbal adverbs (i.e. words suffixed with ): e.g.  'shouting',  'walking'.\n* Foreign loanwords: e.g.  'cliché',  'genesis',  'literature', , 'Alexander' (Possibly based on hellenised variations of indigenous Bryges and/or Enchele naming conventions), etc.\n\nGrammar\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly analytic in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an auxiliary verb \"to have\", followed by a past participle in the neuter, also known as the verbal adjective.\n\nNouns\n\nMacedonian nouns (именки, imenki) belong to one of three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are inflected for number (singular and plural), and marginally for case. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.  The Macedonian nominal system distinguishes two numbers (singular and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), case and definiteness. Definiteness is expressed by three definite articles pertaining to the position of the object (unspecified, proximate, and distal), which are suffixed to the noun.\n\nVerbs\n\nMacedonian has a complex system of verbs. Generally speaking Macedonian verbs have the following characteristics, or categories as they are called in Macedonistics: tense, mood, person, type, transitiveness, voice, gender and number.\n\nAccording to the categorization, all Macedonian verbs are divided into three major groups: a-group, e-group and i-group. Furthermore, the i-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: a-, e- and i-subgroups. This division is done according to the ending (or the last vowel) of the verb in the simple present, singular, third person. Regarding the form, the verb forms can be either simple or complex.\n\nThe Macedonian simple verb forms are:\n* Present tense  (сегашно време)\n* Imperfect (минато определено несвршено време, 'past definite incomplete tense')\n* Aorist (минато определено свршено време, 'past definite complete tense')\n* Imperative  (заповеден начин)\n* Verbal l-form (глаголска л-форма)\n* Verbal adjective (глаголска придавка)\n* Verbal noun (глаголска именка)\n* Verbal adverb (глаголски прилог)\n\nThe Macedonian complex verb forms are:\n* Perfect of imperfective verbs (минато неопределено несвршено време, 'past indefinite incomplete tense')\n* Perfect of perfective verbs ( минато неопределено свршено време, 'past indefinite complete tense')\n* Past perfect tense (предминато време)\n* Future tense  (идно време)\n* Future-in-the-past (минато-идно време)\n* Future perfect tense (идно прекажано)\n* Potential mood (можен начин)\n* Have-construction (има-конструкција)\n* Be-construction (сум-конструкција)\n* To-construction (да-конструкција)\n\nPrepositions\n\nPrepositions (предлози, predlozi) are part of the closed word class that are used to express the relationship between the words in a sentence. Because Macedonian lost its case system, the prepositions are very important for creation and expression of various grammatical categories. The most important Macedonian preposition is 'na' ('of', 'on', 'to'). Regarding the form, the prepositions can either be simple or complex. Based on the meaning the preposition express, they can be divided into prepositions of time, place, manner and quantity.Кепески, К. (1946), Македонска граматика, Скопје, Државно книгоиздавателство на Македонија.\n\nVocabulary\n\nAs a result of the close relationship with Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian shares a considerable amount of its lexicon with these languages. Other languages that have been in positions of power, such as Ottoman Turkish and, increasingly, English have also provided a significant proportion of the loanwords. Prestige languages, such as Old Church Slavonic—which occupies a relationship to modern Macedonian comparable to the relationship of medieval Latin to modern Romance languages—and Russian also provided a source for lexical items.\n\nDuring the standardization process, there was deliberate care taken to try to purify the lexicon of the language. Serbianisms and Bulgarianisms, which had become common due to the influence of these languages in the region were rejected in favor of words from native dialects and archaisms. One example was the word for \"event\", настан, which was found in certain examples of folk poetry collected by the Miladinov Brothers in the 19th century, whereas the Macedonian writer Krste Misirkov had previously used the word собитие, a Russian loanword (событие).In his most famous work \"On the Macedonian Matters\" (available [http://www.misirkov.org/ online] ), Misirkov uses the word собитие (a Russian loan taken from Bulgarian) where настан is used today. This is not to say that there are no Serbianisms, Bulgarianisms or even Russianisms in the language, but rather that they were discouraged on a principle of \"seeking native material first\".\n\nThe language of the writers at the turn of the 19th century abounded with Russian and, more specifically, Old Church Slavonic lexical and morphological elements that in the contemporary norm are substituted with native words or calqued using productive morphemes.Т. Димитровски. Литературната лексика на македонскиот писмен јазик во XIX в. и нашиот однос кон неа: Реферати на македонските слависти за VI Меѓународен славистички конгрес во Прага, Скопје, 1968 (T. Dimitrovski. The literary vocabulary of the Macedonian written language in the 19th century and our attitude to it. Abstracts of Macedonian Slavists for the 6th International Slavic Studies Congress in Prague. Skopje, 1968) Thus, the now slightly archaicized forms with suffixes –ние and –тел, adjectives with the suffixes –телен and others, are now constructed following patterns more typical of Macedonian morphology. For example, дејствие (Russ. действие) corresponds to дејство 'action', лицемерие (Russ. лицемерие) → лицемерство 'hypocrisy', развитие (Russ. развитие) → развиток 'development', определение (Russ. определение) → определба 'determination, orientation', движение (Russ. движение) → движење 'movement', продолжител (Russ. продолжитель) → продолжувач 'extender, continuator', победител (Russ. победитель) → победник 'winner, victor', убедителен (Russ. убедительный) → убедлив 'convincing, persuasive', etc. Many of these words are now obsolete or archaic (as with развитие), synonymous (лицемерие and лицемерство) or have taken on a slightly different nuance in meaning (дејствие 'military act' vs. дејство 'act, action' in a general sense).\n\nThe use of Ottoman Turkish loanwords is discouraged in the formal register when a native equivalent exists (e.g. комшија (← Turk. komşu) vs. сосед (← PSl. *sǫsědъ) 'neighbor'), and these words are typically restricted to the archaic, colloquial, and ironic registers.Friedman, V. (1998) \"The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results\" in International Journal of the Sociology of Language, Vol. 131, pp. 31-57, p. 8\n\nNew words were coined according to internal logic and others calqued from related languages (especially Serbo-Croatian) to replace those taken from Russian, which include известие (Russ. известие) → извештај 'report', количество (Russ. количество) → количина 'amount, quantity', согласие (Russ. согласие) → слога 'concord, agreement', etc. This change was aimed at bringing written Macedonian closer to the spoken language, effectively distancing it from the Bulgarian language with its numerous Russian loans, and represents a successful puristic attempt to abolish a lexicogenic tradition once common in written literature.\n\nWriting system\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe modern Macedonian alphabet was developed by linguists in the period after the Second World War, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, though a similar writing system was used by Krste Misirkov in the early 20th century. The Macedonian language had previously been written using the Early Cyrillic alphabet, or later using the Cyrillic script with local adaptations from either the Serbian or Bulgarian alphabets.\n\nThe following table provides the upper and lower case forms of the Macedonian alphabet, along with the IPA value for each letter:\n\nOrthography\n\nMacedonian orthography is consistent and phonemic in practice, an approximation of the principle of one grapheme per phoneme. A principle represented by Adelung's saying, \"write as you speak and read as it is written\" (\"пишувај како што зборуваш и читај како што е напишано\"). However, there are occasional inconsistencies or exceptions.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Lord's Prayer\n\nОче наш (Cyrillic alphabet)\n\nОче наш, кој си на небесата,\nда се свети името Твое,\nда дојде царството Твое,\nда биде волјата Твоја,\nкако на небото, така и на земјата;\nлебот наш насушен дај ни го денес\nи прости ни ги долговите наши\nкако и ние што им ги проштеваме на нашите должници;\nи не нѐ воведувај во искушение,\nно избави нѐ од лукавиот.\nЗашто Твое е Царството и Силата и Славата, во вечни векови.\nАмин!\n\nOče naš (Latinic version)\n\nOče naš, koj si na nebesata\nda se sveti imeto Tvoe,\nda dojde carstvoto Tvoe,\nda bide voljata Tvoja,\nkako na neboto, taka i na zemjata;\nlebot naš nasušen daj ni go denes\ni prosti ni gi dolgovite naši\nkako i nie što im gi proštevame na našite dolžnici\nI ne nè voveduvaj vo iskušenie,\nno izbavi nè od lukaviot.\nZašto Tvoe e Carstvoto i Silata i Slavata, vo večni vekovi.\nAmin!\n\nHistory\n\nThe region of Macedonia and the Republic of Macedonia are located on the Balkan peninsula. The Slavs first came to the Balkan Peninsula in the sixth and seventh centuries AD. In the ninth century, the Byzantine Greek monksColumbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05, s.v. \"Cyril and Methodius, Saints\"; Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Incorporated, Warren E.

These men were Greeks from Thessaloniki who became apostles to the southern Slavs, whom they converted to Christianity.\" Saints Cyril and Methodius developed the first writing system for the Slavonic languages. At this time, the Slavic dialects were so close as to make it practical to develop the written language on the dialect of a single region. The Ohrid Literary School was established in Ohrid in 886 by Saint Clement of Ohrid on orders of Boris I of Bulgaria. In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the Ottoman Empire. Although the written language, now called Old Church Slavonic, remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] , , Пролет 2010, Лилия Илиева, Нови данни за българската поезия през XVI и XVII век. can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro. Avec la collaboration de Andre Vaillant, 1958 The concept of the various Macedonian dialects as a part of the Bulgarian languageConcise encyclopedia of languages of the world, Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Elsevier, 2008, , pp. 120; 663. can be seen also from early vernacular texts from Macedonia such as the four-language dictionary of Daniel Moscopolites, the works of Kiril Peichinovich and Yoakim Karchovski, and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the local Slavic vernacular appeared in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.F. A. K. Yasamee \"NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS\" in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121–132.\n\nIn 1845 the Russian scholar Viktor Grigorovich travelled in the Balkans to study the south Slavic dialects of Macedonia. His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of Bulgarian dialects: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and Republic of Macedonia). According to his findings, a part of the Western Bulgarian variety, spoken in Macedonia, was characterized by traces of Old Slavic nasal vowels. During the increase of national consciousness in the Balkans, standards for the languages of Slovene, Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian were created. As Turkish influence in Macedonia waned, schools were opened up that taught the Bulgarian standard language in areas with significant Bulgarian population.\n\nHowever, the Russian linguist of Bulgarian origin, Petar Draganov (1857–1928), after his visit to Macedonia, strongly opposed this 'Bulgarian origin of the Macedonian dialects', and he claimed that Macedonia is a separate ethnogeographic unit of the Balkans and the Macedonian dialects form a separate language. Similar ideas were proposed in Krste Misirkov's works. Misirkov was born in a village near Pella in Greek Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's On Macedonian Matters, published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a phonemic orthography.\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently the Republic of Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as Vardar Banovina (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.\n\nDuring the second World War, most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and liturgies. The Bulgarians were initially welcomed as liberators from Serbian domination until connections were made between the imposition of the Bulgarian language and unpopular Serbian assimilation policies.The A to Z of Bulgaria, Raymond Detrez, Scarecrow Press, Incorporated, 2010, , p. 485. Even the Macedonian communists were then pro-Bulgarian oriented, but later the Bulgarians were seen as conquerors by the communist movement.,   However, there were pro-Bulgarian groups which advocated independence as a second Bulgarian state, and others, who supported the union with Bulgaria.,  \n\nThe eventual outcome was that almost all of Vardar Banovina (i.e. the areas that geographically became known as Vardar Macedonia) was incorporated into the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a constituent Socialist Republic with the Macedonian language holding official status within both the Federation and Republic. The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on August 2, 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was Blaže Koneski. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the Nova Makedonija newspaper in 1944. Makedonska Iskra (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nPolitical views on the language\n\nAs with the issue of Macedonian ethnicity, the politicians, linguists and common people from Macedonia and neighbouring countries have opposing views about the existence and distinctiveness of the Macedonian language.\n\nIn the ninth century AD, saints Cyril and Methodius introduced Old Church Slavonic, the first Slavic language of literacy. Written with their newly invented Glagolitic script, this language was based largely on the dialect of Slavs spoken around Thessaloniki; this dialect is closest to present-day Macedonian and Bulgarian.\n\nAlthough described as being dialects of Bulgarian or Serbian prior to the establishment of the standard, the current academic consensus (outside of Bulgaria and Greece) is that Macedonian is an autonomous language within the South Slavic dialect continuum.\n\nBulgarian view\n\nIn most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia and Northern Greece was referred to as a group of Bulgarian dialects. The local variants of the name of the language were also balgàrtzki, bùgarski or bugàrski; i.e. Bulgarian.Шклифов, Благой and Екатерина Шклифова, Български деалектни текстове от Егейска Македония, София 2003, с. 28–33 (Shklifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova. Bulgarian dialect texts from Aegean Macedonia Sofia 2003, p. 28–36) Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian. However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem of the Macedonian language by using the euphemistic formula: \"the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution\".\n\nGreek view\n\nGreeks object to the use of the \"Macedonian\" name in reference to the modern Slavic language, calling it \"Slavomacedonian\" (), a term coined by some members of the Slavic-speaking community of northern Greece itself.Although acceptable in the past, current use of this name in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered pejorative and offensive by ethnic Macedonians. In the past, the Macedonian Slavs in Greece seemed relieved to be acknowledged as Slavomacedonians. Pavlos Koufis, a native of Greek Macedonia, pioneer of ethnic Macedonian schools in the region and local historian, says in Laografika Florinas kai Kastorias (Folklore of Florina and Kastoria), Athens 1996:\n\"[During its Panhellenic Meeting in September 1942, the KKE mentioned that it recognises the equality of the ethnic minorities in Greece] the KKE recognised that the Slavophone population was ethnic minority of Slavomacedonians. This was a term, which the inhabitants of the region accepted with relief. [Because] Slavomacedonians = Slavs+Macedonians. The first section of the term determined their origin and classified them in the great family of the Slav peoples.\"\nThe Greek Helsinki Monitor reports:\n\"... the term Slavomacedonian was introduced and was accepted by the community itself, which at the time had a much more widespread non-Greek Macedonian ethnic consciousness. Unfortunately, according to members of the community, this term was later used by the Greek authorities in a pejorative, discriminatory way; hence the reluctance if not hostility of modern-day Macedonians of Greece (i.e. people with a Macedonian national identity) to accept it.\"",

    "aggregatedText" : "Macedonian (; , tr. makedonski,) is a South Slavic language spoken as a first language by around two million people, principally in the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. It is the official language of the Republic of Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.\n\nStandard Macedonian was implemented as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1945 and has since developed a modern literature. Most of the codification was formalized during the same period.Friedman, V. (1998) \"The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results\" in International Journal of the Sociology of Language, Vol. 131, pp. 31-57\n\nMacedonian dialects form a continuum with Bulgarian dialects; they in turn form a broader continuum with Serbo-Croatian through the transitional Torlakian dialects.\n\nThe name of the Macedonian language is a matter of political controversy in Greece and BulgariaMirjana N. Dedaić, Mirjana Misković-Luković. South Slavic discourse particles (John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2010), p. 13 as is its distinctiveness compared to Bulgarian in Bulgaria.Victor Roudometof. Collective memory, national identity, and ethnic conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian question (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002), p. 41[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu\n004&LangID=42 Language profile Macedonian], UCLA International Institute\n\nClassification and related languages\n\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the eastern group of the South Slavic branch of Slavic languages in the Indo-European language family, together with Bulgarian and the extinct Old Church Slavonic. Macedonian's closest relative is Bulgarian, with which it has a high degree of mutual intelligibility. The next closest relative is Serbo-Croatian. Language contact between Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian reached its height during Yugoslav times, when most Macedonians learned Serbo-Croatian as a compulsory language of education and knew and used Serbian (or \"pseudo-Serbian\", i.e. a mixture of Serbian and Macedonian).\n\nAll South Slavic languages, including Macedonian, form a dialect continuum. Macedonian, along with Bulgarian and Torlakian (transitional varieties of Serbo-Croatian), is also a part of the Balkan sprachbund, a group of languages that share typological, grammatical and lexical features based on geographical convergence, rather than genetic proximity. Its other principal members are Romanian, Greek and Albanian, all of which belong to different genetic branches of the Indo-European family (Romanian is a Romance language, whereas Greek and Albanian comprise separate branches). Macedonian and Bulgarian are sharply divergent from the remaining South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, and indeed all other Slavic languages, in that they do not use noun cases (except for the vocative, and apart from some traces of once productive inflections still found scattered throughout the languages) and have lost the infinitive. They are also the only Slavic languages with any definite articles (unlike standard Bulgarian, which uses only one article, standard Macedonian as well as some south-eastern Bulgarian dialects have a set of three based on an external frame of reference: unspecified, proximal and distal definite article). Bulgarian and Macedonian are the only Indo-European languages that make use of the narrative mood.\n\nPrior to the codification of the standard language (Standard Macedonian), Macedonian dialects were described by linguists as being either dialects of BulgarianMazon, André.

Similarly, Torlakian was also widely regarded as Bulgarian.  The boundaries between the South Slavic languages had yet to be \"conceptualized in modern terms,\"Joseph, Brian D. et al. When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Competition and Coexistence; Ohio State University Press (2002), p.261 and codifiers of Serbian even found it necessary to argue that Bulgarian was not a Serbian dialect as late as 1822. On the other hand, many Macedonian intellectuals maintained that their language \"was neither a dialect of Serbian nor of Bulgarian, but a language in its own right\".Max K. Adler. Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study; Buske Verlag (1980), p.215 Prior to the standardization of Macedonian, a number of linguists, among them Antoine Meillet,Antoine Meillet (French, linguist, 1928): Their dialects, differing among themselves, are not truly Serbian nor truly Bulgarian, especially if one is thinking of written Bulgarian, which is based on dialects quite far removed from the Macedonian dialects. In reality these dialects do not properly belong to either the one or the other of the two groups under dispute.1. Todor Dimitrovski, Blaže Koneski, Trajko Stamatoski.

[...] Macedonian is spoken by about 200,000 people in Bulgaria, where it is viewed as a dialect of Bulgaria, and also in the province of Macedonia in northern Greece where the language is called Slavika. However, in the Republic of Macedonia, a separate Macedonian literary language has been in existence since 1944, and most scholars now accept Macedonian as a separate language. The Macedonian standard language is based on a difference group of dialects from the Bulgarian [...].\"R.E.Asher, J.M.Y.Simpson (editors), Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, (1994), vol.1, p.429: \"From a strictly linguistic point of view Macedonian can be called a Bulgarian dialect, as structurally it is most similar to Bulgarian. Indeed, Bulgarian scholars reject Macedonian as an individual language, but since it now has the status of a literary language, most other scholars accept its independent existence.\"Linguasphere 53-AAA-h but this view is politically controversial:\n\nAccording to Olga Mišeska–Tomić:\n\nModern questions of classification are largely shaped by political and social factors. Structurally, Macedonian, Bulgarian and southeastern forms of Serbo-Croatian (Torlakian) form a dialectical continuum that is a legacy of the linguistic developments during the height of the Preslav and Ohrid literary schools.Florin Curta. Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages; 500-1250. ; Cambridge. Pg 216\n\nAlthough it has been claimed that Standard Macedonian was codified on the base of those dialects (i.e. the Prilep-Bitola dialect) most unlike Bulgarian, this interpretation stems from the works of Krste Misirkov, who suggested that Standard Macedonian should abstract on those dialects \"most distinct from the standards of the other Slavonic languages\".Dedaić, Mirjana N. et al. South Slavic Discourse Particles; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13 Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian koiné language was already in existence.Bernard Comrie. The Slavonic Languages; Taylor & Francis (2002), p. 251 The codifiers ultimately chose the same dialects, but did so because they were \"most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers of other dialects.\"John Shea. Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation; McFarland (2008), p.208\n\nGeographical distribution\n\nThe population of the Republic of Macedonia was 2,022,547 in 2002, with 1,644,815 speaking Macedonian as their native language.Popis na Naselenie, Domaćinstva i Stanovi vo Republika Makedonija, 2002 - Vkupno naselenie na Republika Makedonija spored majčin jazik. Outside the Republic, there are Macedonians living in other parts of the geographical area of Macedonia. There are ethnic Macedonian minorities in neighbouring Albania, in Bulgaria, in Greece, and in Serbia. According to the official Albanian census of 1989, 4,697 ethnic Macedonians reside in Albania.\n\nA large number of Macedonians live outside the traditional Balkan Macedonian region, with Australia, Canada and the United States having the largest emigrant communities. According to a 1964 estimate, approximately 580,000 Macedonians live outside the Macedonian Republic, nearly 30% of the total population. The Macedonian language has the status of official language only in the Republic of Macedonia, and is a recognized minority and official language in parts of Albania (Pustec), Romania, and Serbia (Jabuka and Plandište). There are provisions for learning the Macedonian language in Romania as Macedonians are an officially recognized minority group. Macedonian is taught in some universities in Australia, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Russia, Serbia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.\n\nGreece\n\nThe varieties spoken by the Slavophone minority in parts of northern Greece, especially those in the Greek provinces of West and Central Macedonia, are today usually classified as part of the Macedonian language, with those in East Macedonia being transitional towards Bulgarian.Schmieger, R. 1998. \"The situation of the Macedonian language in Greece: sociolinguistic analysis\", International Journal of the Sociology of Language 131, 125–55.; Friedman (2001). Bulgarian linguistics traditionally regards them all as part of the Bulgarian language together with the rest of Macedonian.; Шклифов, Благой. Проблеми на българската диалектна и историческа фонетика с оглед на македонските говори, София 1995, с. 14.; Шклифов, Благой. Речник на костурския говор, Българска диалектология, София 1977, с. кн. VIII, с. 201–205, However, the codification of standard Macedonian has been in effect only in the Republic of Macedonia, and the Slavonic dialects spoken in Greece are thus practically \"roofless\", with their speakers having little access to standard or written Macedonian.\n\nMost of the language speakers in Greece do not identify ethnically as \"Macedonians\", but as ethnic Greeks (Slavophone Greeks) or dopii (locals). Therefore, the simple term \"Macedonian\" as a name for the Slavic language is often avoided in the Greek context, and vehemently rejected by most Greeks, for whom Macedonian has very different connotations. Instead, the language is often called simply \"Slavic\" or \"Slavomacedonian\", with \"Macedonian Slavic\" often being used in English. Speakers themselves variously refer to their language as makedonski, makedoniski (\"Macedonian\"),Lois Whitman (1994): Denying ethnic identity: The Macedonians of Greece Helsinki Human Rights Watch. p.39  slaviká (, \"Slavic\"), dópia or entópia (, \"local/indigenous [language]\"),  balgàrtzki in some parts of the region of Kastoria, bògartski (\"Bulgarian\") in some parts of Dolna Prespa[http://www.promacedonia.org/shklifovi/shklifovi_000_100.pdf Шклифов, Благой and Екатерина Шклифова, Български диалектни текстове от Егейска Македония, София 2003, с. 28-36, 172] - Shkifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova. Bulgarian dialect texts from Aegean Macedonia, Sofia 2003, p. 28-36, 172)  along with naši (\"our own\") and stariski (\"old\").Lois Whitman (1994): Denying ethnic identity: The Macedonians of Greece Helsinki Human Rights Watch. p.37  In Kastoria, however, the name \"Macedonian\" is used as well by the local people.\n\nThe exact number of speakers in Greece is difficult to ascertain, with estimates ranging between 20,000 and 250,000., See Page 90,\n Jacques Bacid estimates in his 1983 book that \"over 200,000 Macedonian speakers remained in Greece\".Jacques Bacid, Ph.D. Macedonia Through the Ages. Columbia University, 1983. Other sources put the numbers of speakers at 180,000 220,000 and 250,000, whereas Yugoslav sources vary, some putting the estimated number of \"Macedonians in Greek Macedonia\" at 150,000–200,000 and others at 300,000. The Encyclopædia Britannicahttp://www.britannica.com/new-multimedia/pdf/wordat077.pdf and the Reader's Digest World Guide both put the figure of ethnic Macedonians in Greece at 1.8% or c.200,000 people, with the native language roughly corresponding with the figures. The UCLA also states that there are 200,000 Macedonian speakers in Greece.[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID42&menu\n004 UCLA Language Materials Project: Language Profile] A 2008 article in the Greek newspaper Eleftherotypia put the estimate at 20,000.[http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c110,dt\n03.08.2008,id=62864592 Eleftherotypia article] \n\nThe largest group of speakers are concentrated in the Florina, Kastoria, Edessa, Giannitsa, Ptolemaida and Naousa regions. During the Greek Civil War, the codified Macedonian language was taught in 87 schools with 10,000 students in areas of northern Greece under the control of Communist-led forces, until their defeat by the National Army in 1949. In recent years, there have been attempts to have the language recognized as a minority language.\n\nRelationship to Bulgarian\n\nThe historical and linguistic relationships between the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages are special and complicated. Macedonian researchers claim Macedonian is spoken in southwestern Bulgaria, whereas Bulgarian and Greek linguists argue Macedonian is a variety of Bulgarian.\n\nThe rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire began to degrade its specific social system, and especially the so-called Rum millet, through constant identification of the religious creed with ethnicity. The national awakening of each ethnic group was complex and most of the groups interacted with each other.\n\nDuring the Bulgarian national revival, which occurred in the first half of the 19th century, the Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs under the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy wanted to create their own Church and schools which would use a common modern \"Macedono-Bulgarian\" literary standard, called simply Bulgarian. The national elites active in this movement used mainly ethnolinguistic principles to differentiation between \"Slavic-Bulgarian\" and \"Greek\" groups.From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870–1913. Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. At that time, every ethnographic subgroup in the Macedonian-Bulgarian linguistic area wrote in their own local dialect and choosing a \"base dialect\" for the new standard was not an issue. Subsequently, during the 1850s and 1860s a long discussion was held in the Bulgarian periodicals about the need for a dialectal group (eastern, western or compromise) upon which to base the new standard and which dialect that should be. During the 1870s this issue became contentious, and sparked fierce debates.Ц. Билярски, Из българския възрожденски печат от 70-те години на XIX в. за македонския въпрос, сп. \"Македонски преглед\", г. XXIII, София, 2009, кн. 4, с. 103-120.\n\nIn 1878, a distinct Bulgarian state was established. The new state did not include the region of Macedonia which remained outside its borders in the frame of the Ottoman Empire. As a consequence, the idea of a common compromise standard was rejected by the Bulgarian codifiers during the 1880s and the eastern Bulgarian dialects were chosen as a basis for standard Bulgarian. Macedono-Bulgarian writers and organizations who continued to seek greater representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian standard were deemed separatists.[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/003Friedman75.pdf \"Macedonian Language and Nationalism During the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries\"], Victor Friedman, p. 286, Victor Roudometof, Roland Robertson, p. 145\"Though Loza adhered to the Bulgarian position on the issue of the Macedonian Slavs' ethnicity, it also favored revising the Bulgarian orthography by bringing it closer to the dialects spoken in Macedonia.\" Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 241.The Young Macedonian Literary Association's Journal, Loza, was also categorical about the Bulgarian character of Macedonia: \"A mere comparison of those ethnographic features which characterize the Macedonians (we understand: Macedonian Bulgarians), with those which characterize the free Bulgarians, their juxtaposition with those principles for nationality which we have formulated above, is enough to prove and to convince everybody that the nationality of the Macedonians cannot be anything except Bulgarian.\" Freedom or Death, The Life of Gotsé Delchev, Mercia MacDermott, The Journeyman Press, London & West Nyack, 1978, p. 86.\"Macedonian historiography often refers to the group of young activists who founded in Sofia an association called the ‘Young Macedonian Literary Society’. In 1892, the latter began publishing the review Loza [The Vine], which promoted certain characteristics of Macedonian dialects. At the same time, the activists, called ‘Lozars’ after the name of their review, ‘purified’ the Bulgarian orthography from some rudiments of the Church Slavonic. They expressed likewise a kind of Macedonian patriotism attested already by the first issue of the review: its materials greatly emphasized identification with Macedonia as a genuine ‘fatherland’. In any case, it is hardly surprising that the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty: what is more interesting is namely the fact that their Bulgarian nationalism was somehow harmonized with a Macedonian self-identification that was not only a political one but also demonstrated certain ‘cultural’ contents. \"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe\", Diana Miškova, Central European University Press, 2009, , p. 120. One example is the Young Macedonian Literary Association, which the Bulgarian government outlawed in 1892. Though standard Bulgarian was taught in the local schools in Macedonia till 1913, the fact of political separation became crucial for the development of a separate Macedonian language.\n\nWith the advent of Macedonian nationalism, the idea of linguistic separatism emerged in the late 19th century, and the need for a separate Macedonian standard language subsequently appeared in the early 20th century. In the Interwar period, the territory of today's Republic of Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgarian was banned for use and the local vernacular fell under heavy influence from the official Serbo-Croatian language. However, the political and paramilitary organizations of the Macedonian Slavs in Europe and the Americas, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Macedonian Patriotic Organization (MPO), and even their left-wing offsets, the IMRO (United) and the Macedonian-American People's League continued to use literary Bulgarian in their writings and propaganda in the interbellum. During the World wars Bulgaria's short annexations over Macedonia saw two attempts to bring the Macedonian dialects back towards Bulgarian. This political situation stimulated the necessity of a separate Macedonian language and led gradually to its codification after the Second World War. It followed the establishment of SR Macedonia, as part of Communist Yugoslavia and finalized the\nprogressive split in the common Macedonian–Bulgarian language.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs shifted from predominantly Bulgarian to ethnic Macedonian and their regional identity had become their national one.\"Up until the early 20th century and beyond, the international community viewed Macedonians as a regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians.\" , .\"At the end of the WWI there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.\" , \"During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.\" , . Although, there was no clear separating line between these two languages on level of dialect then, the Macedonian standard was based on its westernmost dialects. Afterwards, Macedonian became the official language in the new republic, Serbo-Croatian was adopted as a second official language, and Bulgarian was proscribed. Moreover, in 1946-1948 the newly standardized Macedonian language was introduced as a second language even in Southwestern Bulgaria., . Subsequently, the sharp and continuous deterioration of the political relationships between the two countries, the influence of both standard languages during the time, but also the strong Serbo-Croatian linguistic influence in Yugoslav era, led to a horizontal cross-border dialectal divergence. Although some researchers have described the standard Macedonian and Bulgarian languages as varieties of a pluricentric language, they in fact have separate dialectal bases; the Prilep-Bitola dialect and Central Balkan dialect, respectively. The prevailing academic consensus (outside of Bulgaria and Greece) is that Macedonian and Bulgarian are two autonomous languages within the eastern subbranch of the South Slavic languages.Trudgill, Peter (1992), \"Ausbau sociolinguistics and the perception of language status in contemporary Europe\", International Journal of Applied Linguistics 2 (2): 167–177 Macedonian is thus an ausbau language; i.e. it is delimited from Bulgarian as these two standard languages have separate dialectal bases.Fishman, Joshua. \"Languages late to literacy: finding a place in the sun on a crowded beach\". In: Joseph, Brian D. et al. (ed.), When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Competition and Coexistence; Ohio State University Press (2002), pp. 107-108.\n\nUsage\n\nThe total number of Macedonian speakers is highly disputed. Although the precise number of speakers is unknown, figures of between 1.6 million (from [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mkd Ethnologue]) and 2–2.5 million have been cited; see  and . The general academic consensus is that there are approximately 2 million speakers of the Macedonian language, accepting that \"it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Macedonian due to the official policies of the neighbouring Balkan states and the fluid nature of emigration\" . According to the censuses and figures, the number of speakers of Macedonian is:\n\nDialects\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern and Western groups (the boundary runs approximately from Skopje and Skopska Crna Gora along the rivers Vardar and Crna). In addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the Proto-Slavic reduced vowels (yers), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *ǫ. That classification distinguishes between the following 5 groups:\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* Ohrid-Prespa Group\n** Ohrid dialect\n** Struga dialect\n** Vevčani-Radožda dialect\n** Upper Prespa dialect\n** Lower Prespa dialect.\n* Debar Group\n** Debar dialect\n** Reka dialect\n** Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect\n** Galičnik dialect\n** Skopska Crna Gora dialect\n** Gora dialect\n* Polog Group\n** Upper Polog dialect\n** Lower Polog dialect\n** Prilep-Bitola dialect\n** Kičevo-Poreče dialect\n** Skopje-Veles dialect\n* Kostur-Korča Group\n** Korča dialect\n** Kostur dialect\n** Nestram-Kostenar dialect\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* Northern Group\n** Kumanovo dialect\n** Kratovo dialect\n** Kriva Palanka dialect\n** Ovče Pole dialect\n* Eastern Group\n** Štip - Kočani dialect\n** Strumica dialect\n** Tikveš-Mariovo dialect\n** Maleševo-Pirin dialect\n** Solun-Voden dialect\n** Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect.\n\nThe Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect and Maleševo-Pirin dialect are also considered Bulgarian dialects.\n\nPhonology\n\nThis discusses the phonological system of Standard Macedonian (unless otherwise noted) based on the Prilep-Bitola dialect.  For discussion of other dialects, see Macedonian dialects. Macedonian possesses five vowels, one semivowel, three liquid consonants, three nasal stops, three pairs of fricatives, two pairs of affricates, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of stops.\n\nVowels\n\nSchwa\nThe schwa is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to or) but its use in the standard language is marginal. When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an apostrophe is used; for example, , , etc. When spelling aloud, each consonant is followed by the schwa. The individual letters of acronyms are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: . The lexicalized acronyms  and  (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions.\n\nVowel length\nVowel length is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penult can be realized as long, e.g.  'Veles'. The sequence is often realized phonetically as; e.g.  colloq. hour'.\n\nConsonants\n\n The alveolar trill is syllabic between two consonants; for example,  'finger'. The dental nasal and dental lateral are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g.  'newton',   'Popocatépetl', etc.\n\nThe labiodental nasal occurs as an allophone of before and (e.g.  'tram'). The velar nasal similarly occur as an allophone of before and (e.g.  'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\nPhonological processes\n\nAt morpheme boundaries (represented in spelling) and at the end of a word (not represented in spelling), voicing opposition is neutralized.\n\nStress\n\nThe word stress in Macedonian is antepenultimate, meaning it falls on the third from last syllable in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source. The following rules apply:\n* Disyllabic words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable.\n\nFor example,  'child',  'mother' and  'father'.\n* Trisyllabic and polysyllabic words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable.\n\nFor example,  'mountain',  'the mountain' and  'the mountaineers'.\n\nExceptions include:\n* Verbal adverbs (i.e. words suffixed with ): e.g.  'shouting',  'walking'.\n* Foreign loanwords: e.g.  'cliché',  'genesis',  'literature', , 'Alexander' (Possibly based on hellenised variations of indigenous Bryges and/or Enchele naming conventions), etc.\n\nGrammar\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly analytic in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an auxiliary verb \"to have\", followed by a past participle in the neuter, also known as the verbal adjective.\n\nNouns\n\nMacedonian nouns (именки, imenki) belong to one of three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are inflected for number (singular and plural), and marginally for case. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.  The Macedonian nominal system distinguishes two numbers (singular and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), case and definiteness. Definiteness is expressed by three definite articles pertaining to the position of the object (unspecified, proximate, and distal), which are suffixed to the noun.\n\nVerbs\n\nMacedonian has a complex system of verbs. Generally speaking Macedonian verbs have the following characteristics, or categories as they are called in Macedonistics: tense, mood, person, type, transitiveness, voice, gender and number.\n\nAccording to the categorization, all Macedonian verbs are divided into three major groups: a-group, e-group and i-group. Furthermore, the i-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: a-, e- and i-subgroups. This division is done according to the ending (or the last vowel) of the verb in the simple present, singular, third person. Regarding the form, the verb forms can be either simple or complex.\n\nThe Macedonian simple verb forms are:\n* Present tense  (сегашно време)\n* Imperfect (минато определено несвршено време, 'past definite incomplete tense')\n* Aorist (минато определено свршено време, 'past definite complete tense')\n* Imperative  (заповеден начин)\n* Verbal l-form (глаголска л-форма)\n* Verbal adjective (глаголска придавка)\n* Verbal noun (глаголска именка)\n* Verbal adverb (глаголски прилог)\n\nThe Macedonian complex verb forms are:\n* Perfect of imperfective verbs (минато неопределено несвршено време, 'past indefinite incomplete tense')\n* Perfect of perfective verbs ( минато неопределено свршено време, 'past indefinite complete tense')\n* Past perfect tense (предминато време)\n* Future tense  (идно време)\n* Future-in-the-past (минато-идно време)\n* Future perfect tense (идно прекажано)\n* Potential mood (можен начин)\n* Have-construction (има-конструкција)\n* Be-construction (сум-конструкција)\n* To-construction (да-конструкција)\n\nPrepositions\n\nPrepositions (предлози, predlozi) are part of the closed word class that are used to express the relationship between the words in a sentence. Because Macedonian lost its case system, the prepositions are very important for creation and expression of various grammatical categories. The most important Macedonian preposition is 'na' ('of', 'on', 'to'). Regarding the form, the prepositions can either be simple or complex. Based on the meaning the preposition express, they can be divided into prepositions of time, place, manner and quantity.Кепески, К. (1946), Македонска граматика, Скопје, Државно книгоиздавателство на Македонија.\n\nVocabulary\n\nAs a result of the close relationship with Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian shares a considerable amount of its lexicon with these languages. Other languages that have been in positions of power, such as Ottoman Turkish and, increasingly, English have also provided a significant proportion of the loanwords. Prestige languages, such as Old Church Slavonic—which occupies a relationship to modern Macedonian comparable to the relationship of medieval Latin to modern Romance languages—and Russian also provided a source for lexical items.\n\nDuring the standardization process, there was deliberate care taken to try to purify the lexicon of the language. Serbianisms and Bulgarianisms, which had become common due to the influence of these languages in the region were rejected in favor of words from native dialects and archaisms. One example was the word for \"event\", настан, which was found in certain examples of folk poetry collected by the Miladinov Brothers in the 19th century, whereas the Macedonian writer Krste Misirkov had previously used the word собитие, a Russian loanword (событие).In his most famous work \"On the Macedonian Matters\" (available [http://www.misirkov.org/ online] ), Misirkov uses the word собитие (a Russian loan taken from Bulgarian) where настан is used today. This is not to say that there are no Serbianisms, Bulgarianisms or even Russianisms in the language, but rather that they were discouraged on a principle of \"seeking native material first\".\n\nThe language of the writers at the turn of the 19th century abounded with Russian and, more specifically, Old Church Slavonic lexical and morphological elements that in the contemporary norm are substituted with native words or calqued using productive morphemes.Т. Димитровски. Литературната лексика на македонскиот писмен јазик во XIX в. и нашиот однос кон неа: Реферати на македонските слависти за VI Меѓународен славистички конгрес во Прага, Скопје, 1968 (T. Dimitrovski. The literary vocabulary of the Macedonian written language in the 19th century and our attitude to it. Abstracts of Macedonian Slavists for the 6th International Slavic Studies Congress in Prague. Skopje, 1968) Thus, the now slightly archaicized forms with suffixes –ние and –тел, adjectives with the suffixes –телен and others, are now constructed following patterns more typical of Macedonian morphology. For example, дејствие (Russ. действие) corresponds to дејство 'action', лицемерие (Russ. лицемерие) → лицемерство 'hypocrisy', развитие (Russ. развитие) → развиток 'development', определение (Russ. определение) → определба 'determination, orientation', движение (Russ. движение) → движење 'movement', продолжител (Russ. продолжитель) → продолжувач 'extender, continuator', победител (Russ. победитель) → победник 'winner, victor', убедителен (Russ. убедительный) → убедлив 'convincing, persuasive', etc. Many of these words are now obsolete or archaic (as with развитие), synonymous (лицемерие and лицемерство) or have taken on a slightly different nuance in meaning (дејствие 'military act' vs. дејство 'act, action' in a general sense).\n\nThe use of Ottoman Turkish loanwords is discouraged in the formal register when a native equivalent exists (e.g. комшија (← Turk. komşu) vs. сосед (← PSl. *sǫsědъ) 'neighbor'), and these words are typically restricted to the archaic, colloquial, and ironic registers.Friedman, V. (1998) \"The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results\" in International Journal of the Sociology of Language, Vol. 131, pp. 31-57, p. 8\n\nNew words were coined according to internal logic and others calqued from related languages (especially Serbo-Croatian) to replace those taken from Russian, which include известие (Russ. известие) → извештај 'report', количество (Russ. количество) → количина 'amount, quantity', согласие (Russ. согласие) → слога 'concord, agreement', etc. This change was aimed at bringing written Macedonian closer to the spoken language, effectively distancing it from the Bulgarian language with its numerous Russian loans, and represents a successful puristic attempt to abolish a lexicogenic tradition once common in written literature.\n\nWriting system\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe modern Macedonian alphabet was developed by linguists in the period after the Second World War, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, though a similar writing system was used by Krste Misirkov in the early 20th century. The Macedonian language had previously been written using the Early Cyrillic alphabet, or later using the Cyrillic script with local adaptations from either the Serbian or Bulgarian alphabets.\n\nThe following table provides the upper and lower case forms of the Macedonian alphabet, along with the IPA value for each letter:\n\nOrthography\n\nMacedonian orthography is consistent and phonemic in practice, an approximation of the principle of one grapheme per phoneme. A principle represented by Adelung's saying, \"write as you speak and read as it is written\" (\"пишувај како што зборуваш и читај како што е напишано\"). However, there are occasional inconsistencies or exceptions.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Lord's Prayer\n\nОче наш (Cyrillic alphabet)\n\nОче наш, кој си на небесата,\nда се свети името Твое,\nда дојде царството Твое,\nда биде волјата Твоја,\nкако на небото, така и на земјата;\nлебот наш насушен дај ни го денес\nи прости ни ги долговите наши\nкако и ние што им ги проштеваме на нашите должници;\nи не нѐ воведувај во искушение,\nно избави нѐ од лукавиот.\nЗашто Твое е Царството и Силата и Славата, во вечни векови.\nАмин!\n\nOče naš (Latinic version)\n\nOče naš, koj si na nebesata\nda se sveti imeto Tvoe,\nda dojde carstvoto Tvoe,\nda bide voljata Tvoja,\nkako na neboto, taka i na zemjata;\nlebot naš nasušen daj ni go denes\ni prosti ni gi dolgovite naši\nkako i nie što im gi proštevame na našite dolžnici\nI ne nè voveduvaj vo iskušenie,\nno izbavi nè od lukaviot.\nZašto Tvoe e Carstvoto i Silata i Slavata, vo večni vekovi.\nAmin!\n\nHistory\n\nThe region of Macedonia and the Republic of Macedonia are located on the Balkan peninsula. The Slavs first came to the Balkan Peninsula in the sixth and seventh centuries AD. In the ninth century, the Byzantine Greek monksColumbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05, s.v. \"Cyril and Methodius, Saints\"; Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Incorporated, Warren E.

These men were Greeks from Thessaloniki who became apostles to the southern Slavs, whom they converted to Christianity.\" Saints Cyril and Methodius developed the first writing system for the Slavonic languages. At this time, the Slavic dialects were so close as to make it practical to develop the written language on the dialect of a single region. The Ohrid Literary School was established in Ohrid in 886 by Saint Clement of Ohrid on orders of Boris I of Bulgaria. In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the Ottoman Empire. Although the written language, now called Old Church Slavonic, remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] , , Пролет 2010, Лилия Илиева, Нови данни за българската поезия през XVI и XVII век. can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro. Avec la collaboration de Andre Vaillant, 1958 The concept of the various Macedonian dialects as a part of the Bulgarian languageConcise encyclopedia of languages of the world, Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Elsevier, 2008, , pp. 120; 663. can be seen also from early vernacular texts from Macedonia such as the four-language dictionary of Daniel Moscopolites, the works of Kiril Peichinovich and Yoakim Karchovski, and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the local Slavic vernacular appeared in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.F. A. K. Yasamee \"NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS\" in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121–132.\n\nIn 1845 the Russian scholar Viktor Grigorovich travelled in the Balkans to study the south Slavic dialects of Macedonia. His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of Bulgarian dialects: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and Republic of Macedonia). According to his findings, a part of the Western Bulgarian variety, spoken in Macedonia, was characterized by traces of Old Slavic nasal vowels. During the increase of national consciousness in the Balkans, standards for the languages of Slovene, Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian were created. As Turkish influence in Macedonia waned, schools were opened up that taught the Bulgarian standard language in areas with significant Bulgarian population.\n\nHowever, the Russian linguist of Bulgarian origin, Petar Draganov (1857–1928), after his visit to Macedonia, strongly opposed this 'Bulgarian origin of the Macedonian dialects', and he claimed that Macedonia is a separate ethnogeographic unit of the Balkans and the Macedonian dialects form a separate language. Similar ideas were proposed in Krste Misirkov's works. Misirkov was born in a village near Pella in Greek Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's On Macedonian Matters, published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a phonemic orthography.\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently the Republic of Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as Vardar Banovina (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.\n\nDuring the second World War, most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and liturgies. The Bulgarians were initially welcomed as liberators from Serbian domination until connections were made between the imposition of the Bulgarian language and unpopular Serbian assimilation policies.The A to Z of Bulgaria, Raymond Detrez, Scarecrow Press, Incorporated, 2010, , p. 485. Even the Macedonian communists were then pro-Bulgarian oriented, but later the Bulgarians were seen as conquerors by the communist movement.,   However, there were pro-Bulgarian groups which advocated independence as a second Bulgarian state, and others, who supported the union with Bulgaria.,  \n\nThe eventual outcome was that almost all of Vardar Banovina (i.e. the areas that geographically became known as Vardar Macedonia) was incorporated into the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a constituent Socialist Republic with the Macedonian language holding official status within both the Federation and Republic. The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on August 2, 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was Blaže Koneski. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the Nova Makedonija newspaper in 1944. Makedonska Iskra (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nPolitical views on the language\n\nAs with the issue of Macedonian ethnicity, the politicians, linguists and common people from Macedonia and neighbouring countries have opposing views about the existence and distinctiveness of the Macedonian language.\n\nIn the ninth century AD, saints Cyril and Methodius introduced Old Church Slavonic, the first Slavic language of literacy. Written with their newly invented Glagolitic script, this language was based largely on the dialect of Slavs spoken around Thessaloniki; this dialect is closest to present-day Macedonian and Bulgarian.\n\nAlthough described as being dialects of Bulgarian or Serbian prior to the establishment of the standard, the current academic consensus (outside of Bulgaria and Greece) is that Macedonian is an autonomous language within the South Slavic dialect continuum.\n\nBulgarian view\n\nIn most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia and Northern Greece was referred to as a group of Bulgarian dialects. The local variants of the name of the language were also balgàrtzki, bùgarski or bugàrski; i.e. Bulgarian.Шклифов, Благой and Екатерина Шклифова, Български деалектни текстове от Егейска Македония, София 2003, с. 28–33 (Shklifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova. Bulgarian dialect texts from Aegean Macedonia Sofia 2003, p. 28–36) Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian. However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem of the Macedonian language by using the euphemistic formula: \"the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution\".\n\nGreek view\n\nGreeks object to the use of the \"Macedonian\" name in reference to the modern Slavic language, calling it \"Slavomacedonian\" (), a term coined by some members of the Slavic-speaking community of northern Greece itself.Although acceptable in the past, current use of this name in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered pejorative and offensive by ethnic Macedonians. In the past, the Macedonian Slavs in Greece seemed relieved to be acknowledged as Slavomacedonians. Pavlos Koufis, a native of Greek Macedonia, pioneer of ethnic Macedonian schools in the region and local historian, says in Laografika Florinas kai Kastorias (Folklore of Florina and Kastoria), Athens 1996:\n\"[During its Panhellenic Meeting in September 1942, the KKE mentioned that it recognises the equality of the ethnic minorities in Greece] the KKE recognised that the Slavophone population was ethnic minority of Slavomacedonians. This was a term, which the inhabitants of the region accepted with relief. [Because] Slavomacedonians = Slavs+Macedonians. The first section of the term determined their origin and classified them in the great family of the Slav peoples.\"\nThe Greek Helsinki Monitor reports:\n\"... the term Slavomacedonian was introduced and was accepted by the community itself, which at the time had a much more widespread non-Greek Macedonian ethnic consciousness. Unfortunately, according to members of the community, this term was later used by the Greek authorities in a pejorative, discriminatory way; hence the reluctance if not hostility of modern-day Macedonians of Greece (i.e. people with a Macedonian national identity) to accept it.\".
