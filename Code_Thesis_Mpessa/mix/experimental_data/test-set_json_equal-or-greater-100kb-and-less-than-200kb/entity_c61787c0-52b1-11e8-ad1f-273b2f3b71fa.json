  "textBody" : "The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, \"the books\") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans.\n\nMany different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.\n\nAttitudes towards the Bible also differ amongst Christian groups. Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the Protestant Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only source of Christian teaching.\n\nWith estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. It sells approximately 100 million copies annually, and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed using movable type.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word Bible is from the Latin biblia, from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from Koine Greek  ta biblia \"the books\" (singular  biblion).\n\nMedieval Latin biblia is short for biblia sacra \"holy book\", while biblia in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. bibliorum). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.\nLatin biblia sacra \"holy books\" translates Greek  ta biblia ta hagia, \"the holy books\".[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319917 Biblion, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus].\n\nThe word  itself had the literal meaning of \"paper\" or \"scroll\" and came to be used as the ordinary word for \"book\".\nIt is the diminutive of  byblos, \"Egyptian papyrus\", possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece.\nThe Greek ta biblia (lit. \"little papyrus books\")Stagg, Frank. New Testament Theology. Nashville: Broadman, 1962. . was \"an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books (the Septuagint).[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/scriptures.html \"From Hebrew Bible to Christian Bible\" by Mark Hamilton] on PBS's site [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/ From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians].[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q\nBible Dictionary.com etymology of the word \"Bible\"]. Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE. The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer (in his Homilies on Matthew, delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia (\"the books\") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together.\n\nTextual history\n\nBy the 2nd century BCE, Jewish groups began calling the books of the Bible the \"scriptures\" and they referred to them as \"holy\", or in Hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible \"The Holy Bible\" (in Greek , tà biblía tà ágia) or \"the Holy Scriptures\" (, e Agía Graphḗ).[http://biblehub.com/greek/1124.htm Bible Hub] – The NT generally uses 1124 (graphḗ) for the Hebrew Scriptures (the OT) – but see also 2 Tim 3:16 and 2 Pet 3:16. 1124 (graphḗ) was used for the Hebrew Scriptures as early as Aristeas (about 130 bc; so MM) The Bible was divided into chapters in the 13th century by Stephen Langton and it was divided into verses in the 16th century by French printer Robert Estienne and is now usually cited by book, chapter, and verse. The division of the Hebrew Bible into verses is based on the sof passuk cantillation mark used by the 10th-century Masoretes to record the verse divisions used in earlier oral traditions.\n\nThe oldest extant copy of a complete Bible is an early 4th-century parchment book preserved in the Vatican Library, and it is known as the Codex Vaticanus. The oldest copy of the Tanakh in Hebrew and Aramaic dates from the 10th century CE. The oldest copy of a complete Latin (Vulgate) Bible is the Codex Amiatinus, dating from the 8th century.\n\nDevelopment\n\nProfessor John K. Riches, Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, says that \"the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the ages\", and \"the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political, cultural, economic, and ecological – varied enormously\". Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, says that the Old Testament is \"a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing.\" He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by God and passed to mankind.\nParallel to the solidification of the Hebrew canon (c. 3rd century BCE), only the Torah first and then the Tanakh began to be translated into Greek and expanded, now referred to as the Septuagint or the Greek Old Testament.\n\nIn Christian Bibles, the New Testament Gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century CE. Riches says that:\n\nScholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the Gospels, but the results have not been too encouraging. The period of transmission is short: less than 40 years passed between the death of Jesus and the writing of Mark's Gospel. This means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed form.\n\nThe Bible was later translated into Latin and other languages. John Riches states that:\n\nThe translation of the Bible into Latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between Western Latin-speaking Christianity and Eastern Christianity, which spoke Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and other languages. The Bibles of the Eastern Churches vary considerably: the Ethiopic Orthodox canon includes 81 books and contains many apocalyptic texts, such as were found at Qumran and subsequently excluded from the Jewish canon. As a general rule, one can say that the Orthodox Churches generally follow the Septuagint in including more books in their Old Testaments than are in the Jewish canon.\n\nHebrew Bible\n\nThe Masoretic Text is the authoritative Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh.  It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,A 7th-century fragment containing the Song of the Sea (Exodus 13:19–16:1) is one of the few surviving texts from the \"silent era\" of Hebrew biblical texts between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Aleppo Codex.

The Torah consists of the following five books:\n* Genesis, Beresheeth (בראשית)\n* Exodus, Shemot (שמות)\n* Leviticus, Vayikra (ויקרא)\n* Numbers, Bamidbar (במדבר)\n* Deuteronomy, Devarim (דברים)\n\nThe first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the creation (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and Jacob's children, the \"Children of Israel\", especially Joseph. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of Ur, eventually to settle in the land of Canaan, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of Moses, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in Ancient Egypt to the renewal of their covenant with God at Mount Sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.[https://books.google.com/books?idAzZlANCOIRgC&printsec\nfrontcover&dqinauthor:%22Seymour+Rossel%22&source\nbl&otsH0fv2a4pWG&sig\nNQIme41Zh-HHQP6XRxIoeYletNE&hlen&sa\nX&eiZddoUKjaLY-o8QT2zYCgDg&ved\n0CDYQuwUwATgK#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] The Torah: Portion by Portion By Seymour Rossel – Torah Aura Productions, 2007, p. 355\n\nThe Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history).Mordecai Kaplan 1934 Judaism as a Civilization MacMillan PressElliot N.

Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (taryag mitzvot).\n\nNevi'im\n\nNevi'im (, \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n\nThe Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, ancient Israel and Judah, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in \"the  God\" and believers in foreign gods,George Savran \"I and II Kings\" in The Literary Guide to the Bible edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode. \"Each king is judged either good or bad in black-and-white terms, according to whether or not he \"did right\" or \"did evil\" in the sight of the Lord. This evaluation is not reflective of the well-being of the nation, of the king's success or failure in war, or of the moral climate of the times, but rather the state of cultic worship during his reign. Those kings who shun idolatry and enact religious reforms are singled out for praise, and those who encourage pagan practices are denounced.\" 146Yehezkel Kaufmann \"Israel In Canaan\" in Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. \"The fight against Baal was initiated by the prophets\" 54 and the criticism of unethical and unjust behaviour of Israelite elites and rulers;Yehezkel Kaufmann \"The Age of Prophecy\" in Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. \"The immediate occasion of the rise of the new prophecy was the political and social ruin caused by the wars with Israel's northerly neighbor, Aram, which continued for more than a century. They raged intensely during the reign of Ahab, and did not end until the time of Jeroboam II (784–744). While the nation as a whole was impoverished, a few – apparently of the royal officialdom – grew wealthy as a result of the national calamity. Many of the people were compelled to sell their houses and lands, with the result that a sharp social cleavage arose: on the one hand a mass of propertyless indigents, on the other a small circle of the rich. A series of disasters struck the nation – drought, famine, plagues, death and captivity (Amos 4: 6–11), but the greatest disaster of all was the social disintegration due to the cleavage between the poor masses and the wealthy, dissolute upper class. The decay affected both Judah and Israel ... High minded men were appalled at this development. Was this the people whom YHWH had brought out of Egypt, to whom He had given the land and a law of justice and right? it seemed as if the land was about to be inherited by the rich, who would squander its substance in drunken revelry. it was this dissolution that brought the prophetic denunciations to white heat.\" 57–58Abraham Joshua Heschel 1955 The Prophets Harper and Row: \"What manner of man is the prophet? A student of philosophy who runs from the discourses of the great metaphysicians to the orations of the prophets may feel as if he were going from the realm of the sublime to an area of trivialities. Instead of dealing with the timeless issues of being and becoming, of matter and form, of definitions and demonstrations, he is thrown into orations about widows and orphans, about the corruption of judges and affairs of the market place. Instead of showing us a way through the elegant mansions of the mind, the prophets take us to the slums. The world is a proud place, full of beauty, but the prophets are scandalized, and rave as if the whole world were a slum. They make much ado about paltry things, lavishing excessive language upon trifling subjects. What if somewhere in ancient Palestine poor people have not been treated properly by the rich? .... Indeed, the sorts of crimes and even the amount of delinquency that fill the prophets of Israel with dismay do not go beyond that which we regard as normal, as typical ingredients of social dynamics. To us a single act of injustice – cheating in business, exploitation of the poor – is slight; to the prophets, a disaster. To us an injustice is injurious to the welfare of the people; to the prophets it is a deathblow to existence; to us an episode; to them, a catastrophe, a threat to the world.\" 3–4Joel Rosenberg \"I and II Samuel\" in The Literary Guide to the Bible edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode. \"Samuel is thus a work of national self-criticism. It recognizes that Israel would not have survived, either politically or culturally, without the steadying presence of a dynastic royal house. But it makes both that house and its subjects answerable to firm standards of prophetic justice – not those of cult prophets or professional ecstatics, but of morally upright prophetic leaders in the tradition of Moses, Joshua, Deborah, Gideon, and others ...\" 141 in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nFormer Prophets\n\nThe Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n* Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua),\n* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges),\n* the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the Books of Samuel)\n* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (Books of Kings)\n\nLatter Prophets\n\nThe Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the \"major\" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets:\n\n* Hosea, Hoshea (הושע)\n* Joel, Yoel (יואל)\n* Amos, Amos (עמוס)\n* Obadiah, Ovadyah (עבדיה)\n* Jonah, Yonah (יונה)\n* Micah, Mikhah (מיכה)\n* Nahum, Nahum (נחום)\n* Habakkuk, Havakuk (חבקוק)\n* Zephaniah, Tsefanya (צפניה)\n* Haggai, Khagay (חגי)\n* Zechariah, Zekharyah (זכריה)\n* Malachi, Malakhi (מלאכי)\n\nKetuvim\n\nKetuvim or Kəṯûḇîm (in  \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy.Neusner, Jacob, The Talmud Law, Theology, Narrative: A Sourcebook. University Press of America, 2005\n\nThe poetic books\n\nIn Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields Emet אמ\"ת, which is also the Hebrew for \"truth\").\n\nThese three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.\n\nThe five scrolls (Hamesh Megillot)\n\nThe five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as \"authoritative\" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.Coogan, Michael D. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: the Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press. 2009; p. 5\n\nOther books\n\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.\n\nOrder of the books\n\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.\n\nThe Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)\n* Tehillim (Psalms) תְהִלִּים\n* Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) מִשְלֵי\n* Iyyôbh (Book of Job) אִיּוֹב\nThe Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)\n* Shīr Hashshīrīm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon) שִׁיר הַשׁשִׁירִים (Passover)\n* Rūth (Book of Ruth) רוּת (Shābhû‘ôth)\n* Eikhah (Lamentations) איכה (Ninth of Av) [Also called Kinnot in Hebrew.]\n* Qōheleth (Ecclesiastes) קהלת (Sukkôth)\n* Estēr (Book of Esther) אֶסְתֵר (Pûrîm)\nOther books\n* Dānî’ēl (Book of Daniel) דָּנִיֵּאל\n* ‘Ezrā (Book of Ezra–Book of Nehemiah) עזרא\n* Divrei ha-Yamim (Chronicles) דברי הימים\n\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b–15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.[https://books.google.com/books?id9NUejG2IGPMC&printsec\nfrontcover#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] The Babylonian Talmud, Vol. 7 of 9: Tract Baba Bathra (Last Gate) translated by Michael L. Rodkinson, first published 1918 – published 2008 by Forgotten Books, p. 53\n\nIn Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra.[http://www.beitemet.com/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id10:ketuvim&catid\n39:about-the-bible&Itemid57&fontstyle\nf-smaller] Ketuvim כְּתוּבִים 30 July 2008\n\nCanonization\n\nThe Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as biblical canon. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the Common Era.\n\nEvidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title. References in the four Gospels as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.\n\nMany scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the Council of Jamnia c. 90 CE. Against Apion, the writing of Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which \"... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable...\"Lightfoot, Neil R. How We Got the Bible, 3rd edition, rev. and expanded. Baker Book House Company. 2003, pp. 154–55. For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny.\n\nOriginal languages\n\nThe Tanakh was mainly written in biblical Hebrew, with some small portions ( and , , ) written in biblical Aramaic, a sister language which became the lingua franca for much of the Semitic world.Sir Godfrey Driver. \"Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible.\" Web: 30 November 2009\n\nSeptuagint \n\nThe Septuagint, or the LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE,[https://books.google.com/books?idowd9zig7i1oC&pg\nPA369 Life after death: a history of the afterlife in the religions of the West (2004)], Anchor Bible Reference Library, Alan F. Segal, p. 363Gilles Dorival, Marguerite Harl, and Olivier Munnich, La Bible grecque des Septante: Du judaïsme hellénistique au christianisme ancien (Paris: Cerfs, 1988), p. 111 initially in Alexandria, but in time it was completed elsewhere as well. It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised.Joel Kalvesmaki, [http://www.kalvesmaki.com/LXX/ The Septuagint]\n\nAs the work of translation progressed, the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the Nevi'im, had various hagiographical works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the Maccabees and the Wisdom of Sirach. However, the book of Sirach, is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Jewish canon.Rick Grant Jones, Various Religious Topics, \"[https://www.webcitation.org/query?urlhttp://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/Septuagint/sp_books.html&date\n2009-10-25+07:45:33 Books of the Septuagint]\", (Accessed 2006.9.5). Some of these deuterocanonical books (e.g. the Wisdom of Solomon, and the second book of Maccabees) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.\n\nSince Late Antiquity, once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century Council of Jamnia, mainstream Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah.\"  Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.\"[...] die griechische Bibelübersetzung, die einem innerjüdischen Bedürfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinen zuerst gerühmt (.) Später jedoch, als manche ungenaue Übertragung des hebräischen Textes in der Septuaginta und Übersetzungsfehler die Grundlage für hellenistische Irrlehren abgaben, lehte man die Septuaginta ab.\" Verband der Deutschen Juden (Hrsg.), neu hrsg. von Walter Homolka, Walter Jacob, Tovia Ben Chorin: Die Lehren des Judentums nach den Quellen; München, Knesebeck, 1999, Bd.3, S. 43ff\"Two things, however, rendered the Septuagint unwelcome in the long run to the Jews. Its divergence from the accepted text (afterward called the Masoretic) was too evident; and it therefore could not serve as a basis for theological discussion or for homiletic interpretation. This distrust was accentuated by the fact that it had been adopted as Sacred Scripture by the new faith [Christianity] [...] In course of time it came to be the canonical Greek Bible [...] It became part of the Bible of the Christian Church.\"\nFinally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek – even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew).Mishnah Sotah (7:2–4 and 8:1), among many others, discusses the sacredness of Hebrew, as opposed to Aramaic or Greek. This is comparable to the authority claimed for the original Arabic Koran according to Islamic teaching. As a result of this teaching, translations of the Torah into Koine Greek by early Jewish Rabbis have survived as rare fragments only.\n\nThe Septuagint is the basis for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.Ernst Würthwein, The Text of the Old Testament, trans. Errol F. Rhodes, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. Eerdmans, 1995. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while Protestant churches usually do not. After the Protestant Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called Biblical apocrypha. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version.\n\nIncorporations from Theodotion\n\nIn most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotion's translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. Jerome reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, \"This thing 'just' happened.\" One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.Jennifer M. Dines, The Septuagint, Michael A. Knibb, Ed., London: T&T Clark, 2004.\n\nThe canonical Ezra–Nehemiah is known in the Septuagint as \"Esdras B\", and 1 Esdras is \"Esdras A\". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra–Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\" – the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.\n\nFinal form\n\nSome texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Odes, including the Prayer of Manasseh, the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.\n\nSome books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν (\"Of Reigns\"). In LXX, the Books of Chronicles supplement Reigns and it is called Paralipomenon (Παραλειπομένων – things left out). The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.\n\nChristian Bibles\n\nA Christian Bible is a set of books that a Christian denomination regards as divinely inspired and thus constituting scripture. Although the Early Church primarily used the Septuagint or the Targums among Aramaic speakers, the apostles did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament developed over time. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.\n\nSignificant versions of the English Christian Bible include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Authorized King James Version, the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version,  the New American Standard Version, the New King James Version, the New International Version, and the English Standard Version.\n\nOld Testament\n\nThe books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see Catholic Bible), Orthodox, and Protestant (see Protestant Bible) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic Peshitta.\n\nApocryphal or deuterocanonical books\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into Western languages. Some modern Western translations since the 14th century make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/the-masoretic-text-and-the-dead-sea-scrolls/ The Masoretic Text and the Dead Sea Scrolls] – biblicalarchaeology.org. Retrieved 26 December 2012.\n\nA number of books which are part of the Peshitta or the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 1545–1563.[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Council of Trent: Decretum de Canonicis Scripturis \"Decree Concerning the Canonical Scriptures\"], from the Council's fourth session, of 4 April 1546: Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session, Celebrated on the eighth day of the month of April, in the year 1546, English translation by James Waterworth (London 1848).The Council of Trent confirmed the identical list/canon of sacred scriptures already anciently approved by the Synod of Hippo (Synod of 393), Council of Carthage, 28 August 397, and [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum17.htm Council of Florence (originally Council of Basel), Session 11, 4 February 1442]  – [Bull of union with the Copts] seventh paragraph down. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.\n\nMost Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes:Canon of Trent: List of the Canonical Scriptures.\n\n* Tobit\n* Judith\n* 1 Maccabees\n* 2 Maccabees\n* Wisdom\n* Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)\n* Baruch\n* The Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch Chapter 6)\n* Greek Additions to Esther (Book of Esther, chapters 10:4–12:6)\n* The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children verses 1–68 (Book of Daniel, chapter 3, verses 24–90)\n* Susanna (Book of Daniel, chapter 13)\n* Bel and the Dragon (Book of Daniel, chapter 14)\n\nIn addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following: \n* 3 Maccabees\n* 1 Esdras\n* Prayer of Manasseh\n* Psalm 151\n\nRussian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include:\n* 2 Esdras i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles\n\nThere is also 4 Maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by St. Jerome in an appendix to the Vulgate, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox tradition includes:\n* Psalms 151–155\n* The Apocalypse of Baruch\n* The Letter of Baruch\n\nThe Ethiopian Biblical canon includes:\n* Jubilees\n* Enoch\n* 1–3 Meqabyan\nand some other books.\n\nThe Anglican Church uses some of the Apocryphal books liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix. \n\nPseudepigraphal books \n\nThe term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The \"Old Testament\" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.\n\n* 3 Maccabees\n* 4 Maccabees\n* Assumption of Moses\n* Ethiopic Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)\n* Slavonic Book of Enoch (2 Enoch)\n* Hebrew Book of Enoch (3 Enoch) (also known as \"The Revelation of Metatron\" or \"The Book of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest\")\n* Book of Jubilees\n* Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch (2 Baruch)\n* Letter of Aristeas  (Letter to Philocrates regarding the translating of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek)\n* Life of Adam and Eve\n* Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah\n* Psalms of Solomon\n* Sibylline Oracles\n* Greek Apocalypse of Baruch (3 Baruch)\n* Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\n\nBook of Enoch \n\nNotable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, surviving only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew, c. 5th to 6th century CE). These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah. They are not part of the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.[http://reluctant-messenger.com/enoch.htm The Book of Enoch] – The Reluctant Messenger. Retrieved 14 June 2014. However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BCE.Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W. The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P–Sh p. 411,  (2004)\n\nDenominational views of Pseudepigrapha \n\nThere arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term pseudepigrapha for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called deuterocanonical and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term pseudepigraphical, as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some Jewish sects. Many works that are \"apocryphal\" are otherwise considered genuine.\n\nRole of the Old Testament in Christian theology\n\nThe Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\" He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the \"new covenant\" prophesied by Jeremiah.\n\nNew Testament\n\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the Christian Bible. Jesus is its central figure.\n\nThe term \"New Testament\" came into use in the second century during a controversy among Christians over whether or not the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament.[https://books.google.com/books?idO5BHAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA343&lpgPA343&dq\nThe+New+Testament+presupposes+the+inspiration+of+the+Old+Testament&sourcebl&ots\n97gNck-NWl&sigrzLPlPu0s8vFu2uNyFxd0BYppng&hl\nen&saX&ei\noWRWUISzCISg8gSo0IH4Bw&ved0CDYQ6AEwAg#v\nonepage&qThe%20New%20Testament%20presupposes%20the%20inspiration%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament&f\nfalse] Inspiration and Inerrancy: A History and a Defense, Henry Preserved Smith – R.

There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page (marginal glosses) to correct their text – especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line – and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text.\n\nThe three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.\n\nDevelopment of the Christian canons\n\nThe Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in 393 CE. Also c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nThe Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon – the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division – while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon. The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.[https://books.google.com/books?idgxEONS0FFlsC&pg\nPA103&lpgPA103&dq\nBoth+Catholics+and+Protestants+have+the+same+27-book+New+Testament+Canon&sourcebl&ots\nt_K6gKrJKM&sig4VIpxeGItb4s5eAyqcVZM5YzYUU&hl\nen&saX&ei\nRvBtUIWiK6PY2gX0j4DIAQ&ved0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v\nonepage&qBoth%20Catholics%20and%20Protestants%20have%20the%20same%2027-book%20New%20Testament%20Canon&f\nfalse] Encyclopedia of Catholicism, Frank K. Flinn, Infobase Publishing, Jan 1, 2007, p. 103\n\nThe New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in , \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God\".\n\nEthiopian Orthodox canon\n\nThe Canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches. There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to Enoch and Jubilees which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament, also Greek Ezra First and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.\n\nDivine inspiration\n\nThe Second Epistle to Timothy says that \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\". () Various related but distinguishable views on divine inspiration include:\n\n* the view of the Bible as the inspired word of God: the belief that God, through the Holy Spirit, intervened and influenced the words, message, and collation of the BibleRice, John R. – Our God-Breathed Book: The Bible – , Sword of the Lord Publishers, 1969, pp 68–88.\n* the view that the Bible is also infallible, and incapable of error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in historic or scientific matters\n* the view that the Bible represents the inerrant word of God, without error in any aspect, spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans\n\nWithin these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate. \"Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture.\" Fundamentalist Christians are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader.\"Beyond Biblical Literalism and Inerrancy: Conservative Protestants and the Hermeneutic Interpretation of Scripture\", John Bartkowski, Sociology of Religion, 57, 1996.\n\nJewish antiquity attests to belief in sacred texts,Philo of Alexandria, De vita Moysis 3.23.Josephus, Contra Apion 1.8. and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention divine agency in relation to its writings. In their book A General Introduction to the Bible, Norman Geisler and William Nix write: \"The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record.\"Norman L. Geisler, William E. Nix. A General Introduction to the Bible. Moody Publishers, 1986, p. 86.  Most evangelical biblical scholarsFor example, see Leroy Zuck, Roy B. Zuck. Basic Bible Interpretation. Chariot Victor Pub, 1991, p. 68. Roy B. Zuck, Donald Campbell. Basic Bible Interpretation. Victor, 2002. Norman L. Geisler. Inerrancy. Zondervan, 1980, p. 294.  associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy which asserted that inspiration applied only to the autographic text of Scripture. Among adherents of Biblical literalism, a minority, such as followers of the King-James-Only Movement, extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular translation.\n\nVersions and translations\n\nThe original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the Targum Onkelos, an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.\n\nThe primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.\n\nThe earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or Vetus Latina, which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAccording to the Latin Decretum Gelasianum (also known as the Gelasian Decree),  thought to be of  a 6th-century document of uncertain authorship and of pseudepigraphal papal authority  (variously ascribed to Pope Gelasius I,  Pope Damasus I, or Pope Hormisdas)  but reflecting the views of the Roman Church by that period, the  Council of Rome  in 382 AD under Pope Damasus I  (366–383) assembled  a list of books of the Bible. Damasus commissioned Saint Jerome to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the Latin Vulgate Bible, in the fourth century AD (although Jerome expressed in his prologues to most  deuterocanonical  books  that they were  non-canonical).[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml Prologues of Saint Jerome,Latin text] In 1546, at the Council of Trent, Jerome's Vulgate translation was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the Latin Church.\n\nSince the Protestant Reformation, Bible translations for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organizations such as Wycliffe Bible Translators, New Tribes Mission and Bible societies.\n\nViews\n\nJohn Riches, professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the Bible:\n\nIt has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.\n\nOther religions\n\nIn Islam, the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding revelation from God; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: tahrif); which necessitated the giving of the Qur'an to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, to correct this deviation.\n\nMembers of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, Rastafaris view the Bible as essential to their religionBecoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica. p. 171, Charles Price. 2009 and Unitarian Universalists view it as \"one of many important religious texts\".Unitarian Universalism. p. 42, Zondervan Publishing, 2009\n\nBiblical studies\n\nBiblical criticism refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have translation errors.\n\nHigher criticism\n\nIn the 17th century Thomas Hobbes collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher Baruch Spinoza published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was \"clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses . . .\"[https://books.google.com/books?idgvrcHyusPbMC&pg\nPA121&lpgPA121&dq\nclearer+than+the+sun+at+noon+that+the+Pentateuch+was+not+written+by+Moses&sourcebl&ots\ntIddvOc2Nv&siglHzsQ_BeqBPGxjK2Z0g94THacK0&hl\nen&saX&ei\no3BWUMr3IInc9ATGx4HoBw&ved0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v\nonepage&qclearer%20than%20the%20sun%20at%20noon%20that%20the%20Pentateuch%20was%20not%20written%20by%20Moses&f\nfalse Ten More Amazing Discoveries By George Potter], Cedar Fort,  2005, p. 121\n\nArchaeological and historical research\n\nBiblical archaeology is the archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the \"New Testament\"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes biblical maximalism which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible to be a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE Babylonian captivity have a basis in history.\n\nThe historicity of the biblical account of the history of ancient Israel and Judah of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the United Monarchy (10th century BCE) and the historicity of David is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the Tel Dan Stele, can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the Exodus from Egypt in the Torah, and the migration to the Promised Land and the period of Judges are not considered historical in scholarship.* \n\nBible Museum \n\nBible Museums of the United States \n\n1) On December 1, 2017, the Museum of the Bible opened in Washington D.C.

Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where \"separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.\"Putnam A.M., Geo.

    "aggregatedText" : "The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, \"the books\") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans.\n\nMany different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.\n\nAttitudes towards the Bible also differ amongst Christian groups. Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the Protestant Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only source of Christian teaching.\n\nWith estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. It sells approximately 100 million copies annually, and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed using movable type.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word Bible is from the Latin biblia, from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from Koine Greek  ta biblia \"the books\" (singular  biblion).\n\nMedieval Latin biblia is short for biblia sacra \"holy book\", while biblia in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. bibliorum). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.\nLatin biblia sacra \"holy books\" translates Greek  ta biblia ta hagia, \"the holy books\".[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319917 Biblion, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus].\n\nThe word  itself had the literal meaning of \"paper\" or \"scroll\" and came to be used as the ordinary word for \"book\".\nIt is the diminutive of  byblos, \"Egyptian papyrus\", possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece.\nThe Greek ta biblia (lit. \"little papyrus books\")Stagg, Frank. New Testament Theology. Nashville: Broadman, 1962. . was \"an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books (the Septuagint).[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/scriptures.html \"From Hebrew Bible to Christian Bible\" by Mark Hamilton] on PBS's site [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/ From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians].[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q\nBible Dictionary.com etymology of the word \"Bible\"]. Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE. The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer (in his Homilies on Matthew, delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia (\"the books\") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together.\n\nTextual history\n\nBy the 2nd century BCE, Jewish groups began calling the books of the Bible the \"scriptures\" and they referred to them as \"holy\", or in Hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible \"The Holy Bible\" (in Greek , tà biblía tà ágia) or \"the Holy Scriptures\" (, e Agía Graphḗ).[http://biblehub.com/greek/1124.htm Bible Hub] – The NT generally uses 1124 (graphḗ) for the Hebrew Scriptures (the OT) – but see also 2 Tim 3:16 and 2 Pet 3:16. 1124 (graphḗ) was used for the Hebrew Scriptures as early as Aristeas (about 130 bc; so MM) The Bible was divided into chapters in the 13th century by Stephen Langton and it was divided into verses in the 16th century by French printer Robert Estienne and is now usually cited by book, chapter, and verse. The division of the Hebrew Bible into verses is based on the sof passuk cantillation mark used by the 10th-century Masoretes to record the verse divisions used in earlier oral traditions.\n\nThe oldest extant copy of a complete Bible is an early 4th-century parchment book preserved in the Vatican Library, and it is known as the Codex Vaticanus. The oldest copy of the Tanakh in Hebrew and Aramaic dates from the 10th century CE. The oldest copy of a complete Latin (Vulgate) Bible is the Codex Amiatinus, dating from the 8th century.\n\nDevelopment\n\nProfessor John K. Riches, Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, says that \"the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the ages\", and \"the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political, cultural, economic, and ecological – varied enormously\". Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, says that the Old Testament is \"a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing.\" He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by God and passed to mankind.\nParallel to the solidification of the Hebrew canon (c. 3rd century BCE), only the Torah first and then the Tanakh began to be translated into Greek and expanded, now referred to as the Septuagint or the Greek Old Testament.\n\nIn Christian Bibles, the New Testament Gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century CE. Riches says that:\n\nScholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the Gospels, but the results have not been too encouraging. The period of transmission is short: less than 40 years passed between the death of Jesus and the writing of Mark's Gospel. This means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed form.\n\nThe Bible was later translated into Latin and other languages. John Riches states that:\n\nThe translation of the Bible into Latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between Western Latin-speaking Christianity and Eastern Christianity, which spoke Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and other languages. The Bibles of the Eastern Churches vary considerably: the Ethiopic Orthodox canon includes 81 books and contains many apocalyptic texts, such as were found at Qumran and subsequently excluded from the Jewish canon. As a general rule, one can say that the Orthodox Churches generally follow the Septuagint in including more books in their Old Testaments than are in the Jewish canon.\n\nHebrew Bible\n\nThe Masoretic Text is the authoritative Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh.  It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,A 7th-century fragment containing the Song of the Sea (Exodus 13:19–16:1) is one of the few surviving texts from the \"silent era\" of Hebrew biblical texts between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Aleppo Codex.

The Torah consists of the following five books:\n* Genesis, Beresheeth (בראשית)\n* Exodus, Shemot (שמות)\n* Leviticus, Vayikra (ויקרא)\n* Numbers, Bamidbar (במדבר)\n* Deuteronomy, Devarim (דברים)\n\nThe first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the creation (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and Jacob's children, the \"Children of Israel\", especially Joseph. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of Ur, eventually to settle in the land of Canaan, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of Moses, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in Ancient Egypt to the renewal of their covenant with God at Mount Sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.[https://books.google.com/books?idAzZlANCOIRgC&printsec\nfrontcover&dqinauthor:%22Seymour+Rossel%22&source\nbl&otsH0fv2a4pWG&sig\nNQIme41Zh-HHQP6XRxIoeYletNE&hlen&sa\nX&eiZddoUKjaLY-o8QT2zYCgDg&ved\n0CDYQuwUwATgK#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] The Torah: Portion by Portion By Seymour Rossel – Torah Aura Productions, 2007, p. 355\n\nThe Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history).Mordecai Kaplan 1934 Judaism as a Civilization MacMillan PressElliot N.

Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (taryag mitzvot).\n\nNevi'im\n\nNevi'im (, \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n\nThe Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, ancient Israel and Judah, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in \"the  God\" and believers in foreign gods,George Savran \"I and II Kings\" in The Literary Guide to the Bible edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode. \"Each king is judged either good or bad in black-and-white terms, according to whether or not he \"did right\" or \"did evil\" in the sight of the Lord. This evaluation is not reflective of the well-being of the nation, of the king's success or failure in war, or of the moral climate of the times, but rather the state of cultic worship during his reign. Those kings who shun idolatry and enact religious reforms are singled out for praise, and those who encourage pagan practices are denounced.\" 146Yehezkel Kaufmann \"Israel In Canaan\" in Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. \"The fight against Baal was initiated by the prophets\" 54 and the criticism of unethical and unjust behaviour of Israelite elites and rulers;Yehezkel Kaufmann \"The Age of Prophecy\" in Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. \"The immediate occasion of the rise of the new prophecy was the political and social ruin caused by the wars with Israel's northerly neighbor, Aram, which continued for more than a century. They raged intensely during the reign of Ahab, and did not end until the time of Jeroboam II (784–744). While the nation as a whole was impoverished, a few – apparently of the royal officialdom – grew wealthy as a result of the national calamity. Many of the people were compelled to sell their houses and lands, with the result that a sharp social cleavage arose: on the one hand a mass of propertyless indigents, on the other a small circle of the rich. A series of disasters struck the nation – drought, famine, plagues, death and captivity (Amos 4: 6–11), but the greatest disaster of all was the social disintegration due to the cleavage between the poor masses and the wealthy, dissolute upper class. The decay affected both Judah and Israel ... High minded men were appalled at this development. Was this the people whom YHWH had brought out of Egypt, to whom He had given the land and a law of justice and right? it seemed as if the land was about to be inherited by the rich, who would squander its substance in drunken revelry. it was this dissolution that brought the prophetic denunciations to white heat.\" 57–58Abraham Joshua Heschel 1955 The Prophets Harper and Row: \"What manner of man is the prophet? A student of philosophy who runs from the discourses of the great metaphysicians to the orations of the prophets may feel as if he were going from the realm of the sublime to an area of trivialities. Instead of dealing with the timeless issues of being and becoming, of matter and form, of definitions and demonstrations, he is thrown into orations about widows and orphans, about the corruption of judges and affairs of the market place. Instead of showing us a way through the elegant mansions of the mind, the prophets take us to the slums. The world is a proud place, full of beauty, but the prophets are scandalized, and rave as if the whole world were a slum. They make much ado about paltry things, lavishing excessive language upon trifling subjects. What if somewhere in ancient Palestine poor people have not been treated properly by the rich? .... Indeed, the sorts of crimes and even the amount of delinquency that fill the prophets of Israel with dismay do not go beyond that which we regard as normal, as typical ingredients of social dynamics. To us a single act of injustice – cheating in business, exploitation of the poor – is slight; to the prophets, a disaster. To us an injustice is injurious to the welfare of the people; to the prophets it is a deathblow to existence; to us an episode; to them, a catastrophe, a threat to the world.\" 3–4Joel Rosenberg \"I and II Samuel\" in The Literary Guide to the Bible edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode. \"Samuel is thus a work of national self-criticism. It recognizes that Israel would not have survived, either politically or culturally, without the steadying presence of a dynastic royal house. But it makes both that house and its subjects answerable to firm standards of prophetic justice – not those of cult prophets or professional ecstatics, but of morally upright prophetic leaders in the tradition of Moses, Joshua, Deborah, Gideon, and others ...\" 141 in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nFormer Prophets\n\nThe Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n* Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua),\n* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges),\n* the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the Books of Samuel)\n* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (Books of Kings)\n\nLatter Prophets\n\nThe Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the \"major\" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets:\n\n* Hosea, Hoshea (הושע)\n* Joel, Yoel (יואל)\n* Amos, Amos (עמוס)\n* Obadiah, Ovadyah (עבדיה)\n* Jonah, Yonah (יונה)\n* Micah, Mikhah (מיכה)\n* Nahum, Nahum (נחום)\n* Habakkuk, Havakuk (חבקוק)\n* Zephaniah, Tsefanya (צפניה)\n* Haggai, Khagay (חגי)\n* Zechariah, Zekharyah (זכריה)\n* Malachi, Malakhi (מלאכי)\n\nKetuvim\n\nKetuvim or Kəṯûḇîm (in  \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy.Neusner, Jacob, The Talmud Law, Theology, Narrative: A Sourcebook. University Press of America, 2005\n\nThe poetic books\n\nIn Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields Emet אמ\"ת, which is also the Hebrew for \"truth\").\n\nThese three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.\n\nThe five scrolls (Hamesh Megillot)\n\nThe five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as \"authoritative\" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.Coogan, Michael D. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: the Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press. 2009; p. 5\n\nOther books\n\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.\n\nOrder of the books\n\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.\n\nThe Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)\n* Tehillim (Psalms) תְהִלִּים\n* Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) מִשְלֵי\n* Iyyôbh (Book of Job) אִיּוֹב\nThe Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)\n* Shīr Hashshīrīm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon) שִׁיר הַשׁשִׁירִים (Passover)\n* Rūth (Book of Ruth) רוּת (Shābhû‘ôth)\n* Eikhah (Lamentations) איכה (Ninth of Av) [Also called Kinnot in Hebrew.]\n* Qōheleth (Ecclesiastes) קהלת (Sukkôth)\n* Estēr (Book of Esther) אֶסְתֵר (Pûrîm)\nOther books\n* Dānî’ēl (Book of Daniel) דָּנִיֵּאל\n* ‘Ezrā (Book of Ezra–Book of Nehemiah) עזרא\n* Divrei ha-Yamim (Chronicles) דברי הימים\n\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b–15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.[https://books.google.com/books?id9NUejG2IGPMC&printsec\nfrontcover#vonepage&q&f\nfalse] The Babylonian Talmud, Vol. 7 of 9: Tract Baba Bathra (Last Gate) translated by Michael L. Rodkinson, first published 1918 – published 2008 by Forgotten Books, p. 53\n\nIn Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra.[http://www.beitemet.com/index.php?optioncom_content&view\narticle&id10:ketuvim&catid\n39:about-the-bible&Itemid57&fontstyle\nf-smaller] Ketuvim כְּתוּבִים 30 July 2008\n\nCanonization\n\nThe Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as biblical canon. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the Common Era.\n\nEvidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title. References in the four Gospels as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.\n\nMany scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the Council of Jamnia c. 90 CE. Against Apion, the writing of Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which \"... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable...\"Lightfoot, Neil R. How We Got the Bible, 3rd edition, rev. and expanded. Baker Book House Company. 2003, pp. 154–55. For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny.\n\nOriginal languages\n\nThe Tanakh was mainly written in biblical Hebrew, with some small portions ( and , , ) written in biblical Aramaic, a sister language which became the lingua franca for much of the Semitic world.Sir Godfrey Driver. \"Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible.\" Web: 30 November 2009\n\nSeptuagint \n\nThe Septuagint, or the LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE,[https://books.google.com/books?idowd9zig7i1oC&pg\nPA369 Life after death: a history of the afterlife in the religions of the West (2004)], Anchor Bible Reference Library, Alan F. Segal, p. 363Gilles Dorival, Marguerite Harl, and Olivier Munnich, La Bible grecque des Septante: Du judaïsme hellénistique au christianisme ancien (Paris: Cerfs, 1988), p. 111 initially in Alexandria, but in time it was completed elsewhere as well. It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised.Joel Kalvesmaki, [http://www.kalvesmaki.com/LXX/ The Septuagint]\n\nAs the work of translation progressed, the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the Nevi'im, had various hagiographical works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the Maccabees and the Wisdom of Sirach. However, the book of Sirach, is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Jewish canon.Rick Grant Jones, Various Religious Topics, \"[https://www.webcitation.org/query?urlhttp://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/Septuagint/sp_books.html&date\n2009-10-25+07:45:33 Books of the Septuagint]\", (Accessed 2006.9.5). Some of these deuterocanonical books (e.g. the Wisdom of Solomon, and the second book of Maccabees) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.\n\nSince Late Antiquity, once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century Council of Jamnia, mainstream Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah.\"  Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.\"[...] die griechische Bibelübersetzung, die einem innerjüdischen Bedürfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinen zuerst gerühmt (.) Später jedoch, als manche ungenaue Übertragung des hebräischen Textes in der Septuaginta und Übersetzungsfehler die Grundlage für hellenistische Irrlehren abgaben, lehte man die Septuaginta ab.\" Verband der Deutschen Juden (Hrsg.), neu hrsg. von Walter Homolka, Walter Jacob, Tovia Ben Chorin: Die Lehren des Judentums nach den Quellen; München, Knesebeck, 1999, Bd.3, S. 43ff\"Two things, however, rendered the Septuagint unwelcome in the long run to the Jews. Its divergence from the accepted text (afterward called the Masoretic) was too evident; and it therefore could not serve as a basis for theological discussion or for homiletic interpretation. This distrust was accentuated by the fact that it had been adopted as Sacred Scripture by the new faith [Christianity] [...] In course of time it came to be the canonical Greek Bible [...] It became part of the Bible of the Christian Church.\"\nFinally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek – even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew).Mishnah Sotah (7:2–4 and 8:1), among many others, discusses the sacredness of Hebrew, as opposed to Aramaic or Greek. This is comparable to the authority claimed for the original Arabic Koran according to Islamic teaching. As a result of this teaching, translations of the Torah into Koine Greek by early Jewish Rabbis have survived as rare fragments only.\n\nThe Septuagint is the basis for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.Ernst Würthwein, The Text of the Old Testament, trans. Errol F. Rhodes, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. Eerdmans, 1995. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while Protestant churches usually do not. After the Protestant Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called Biblical apocrypha. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version.\n\nIncorporations from Theodotion\n\nIn most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotion's translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. Jerome reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, \"This thing 'just' happened.\" One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.Jennifer M. Dines, The Septuagint, Michael A. Knibb, Ed., London: T&T Clark, 2004.\n\nThe canonical Ezra–Nehemiah is known in the Septuagint as \"Esdras B\", and 1 Esdras is \"Esdras A\". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra–Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\" – the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.\n\nFinal form\n\nSome texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Odes, including the Prayer of Manasseh, the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.\n\nSome books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν (\"Of Reigns\"). In LXX, the Books of Chronicles supplement Reigns and it is called Paralipomenon (Παραλειπομένων – things left out). The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.\n\nChristian Bibles\n\nA Christian Bible is a set of books that a Christian denomination regards as divinely inspired and thus constituting scripture. Although the Early Church primarily used the Septuagint or the Targums among Aramaic speakers, the apostles did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament developed over time. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.\n\nSignificant versions of the English Christian Bible include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Authorized King James Version, the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version,  the New American Standard Version, the New King James Version, the New International Version, and the English Standard Version.\n\nOld Testament\n\nThe books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see Catholic Bible), Orthodox, and Protestant (see Protestant Bible) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic Peshitta.\n\nApocryphal or deuterocanonical books\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into Western languages. Some modern Western translations since the 14th century make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/the-masoretic-text-and-the-dead-sea-scrolls/ The Masoretic Text and the Dead Sea Scrolls] – biblicalarchaeology.org. Retrieved 26 December 2012.\n\nA number of books which are part of the Peshitta or the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 1545–1563.[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Council of Trent: Decretum de Canonicis Scripturis \"Decree Concerning the Canonical Scriptures\"], from the Council's fourth session, of 4 April 1546: Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session, Celebrated on the eighth day of the month of April, in the year 1546, English translation by James Waterworth (London 1848).The Council of Trent confirmed the identical list/canon of sacred scriptures already anciently approved by the Synod of Hippo (Synod of 393), Council of Carthage, 28 August 397, and [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum17.htm Council of Florence (originally Council of Basel), Session 11, 4 February 1442]  – [Bull of union with the Copts] seventh paragraph down. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.\n\nMost Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes:Canon of Trent: List of the Canonical Scriptures.\n\n* Tobit\n* Judith\n* 1 Maccabees\n* 2 Maccabees\n* Wisdom\n* Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)\n* Baruch\n* The Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch Chapter 6)\n* Greek Additions to Esther (Book of Esther, chapters 10:4–12:6)\n* The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children verses 1–68 (Book of Daniel, chapter 3, verses 24–90)\n* Susanna (Book of Daniel, chapter 13)\n* Bel and the Dragon (Book of Daniel, chapter 14)\n\nIn addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following: \n* 3 Maccabees\n* 1 Esdras\n* Prayer of Manasseh\n* Psalm 151\n\nRussian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include:\n* 2 Esdras i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles\n\nThere is also 4 Maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by St. Jerome in an appendix to the Vulgate, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox tradition includes:\n* Psalms 151–155\n* The Apocalypse of Baruch\n* The Letter of Baruch\n\nThe Ethiopian Biblical canon includes:\n* Jubilees\n* Enoch\n* 1–3 Meqabyan\nand some other books.\n\nThe Anglican Church uses some of the Apocryphal books liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix. \n\nPseudepigraphal books \n\nThe term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The \"Old Testament\" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.\n\n* 3 Maccabees\n* 4 Maccabees\n* Assumption of Moses\n* Ethiopic Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)\n* Slavonic Book of Enoch (2 Enoch)\n* Hebrew Book of Enoch (3 Enoch) (also known as \"The Revelation of Metatron\" or \"The Book of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest\")\n* Book of Jubilees\n* Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch (2 Baruch)\n* Letter of Aristeas  (Letter to Philocrates regarding the translating of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek)\n* Life of Adam and Eve\n* Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah\n* Psalms of Solomon\n* Sibylline Oracles\n* Greek Apocalypse of Baruch (3 Baruch)\n* Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\n\nBook of Enoch \n\nNotable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, surviving only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew, c. 5th to 6th century CE). These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah. They are not part of the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.[http://reluctant-messenger.com/enoch.htm The Book of Enoch] – The Reluctant Messenger. Retrieved 14 June 2014. However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BCE.Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W. The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P–Sh p. 411,  (2004)\n\nDenominational views of Pseudepigrapha \n\nThere arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term pseudepigrapha for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called deuterocanonical and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term pseudepigraphical, as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some Jewish sects. Many works that are \"apocryphal\" are otherwise considered genuine.\n\nRole of the Old Testament in Christian theology\n\nThe Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\" He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the \"new covenant\" prophesied by Jeremiah.\n\nNew Testament\n\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the Christian Bible. Jesus is its central figure.\n\nThe term \"New Testament\" came into use in the second century during a controversy among Christians over whether or not the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament.[https://books.google.com/books?idO5BHAAAAYAAJ&pg\nPA343&lpgPA343&dq\nThe+New+Testament+presupposes+the+inspiration+of+the+Old+Testament&sourcebl&ots\n97gNck-NWl&sigrzLPlPu0s8vFu2uNyFxd0BYppng&hl\nen&saX&ei\noWRWUISzCISg8gSo0IH4Bw&ved0CDYQ6AEwAg#v\nonepage&qThe%20New%20Testament%20presupposes%20the%20inspiration%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament&f\nfalse] Inspiration and Inerrancy: A History and a Defense, Henry Preserved Smith – R.

There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page (marginal glosses) to correct their text – especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line – and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text.\n\nThe three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.\n\nDevelopment of the Christian canons\n\nThe Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in 393 CE. Also c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nThe Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon – the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division – while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon. The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.[https://books.google.com/books?idgxEONS0FFlsC&pg\nPA103&lpgPA103&dq\nBoth+Catholics+and+Protestants+have+the+same+27-book+New+Testament+Canon&sourcebl&ots\nt_K6gKrJKM&sig4VIpxeGItb4s5eAyqcVZM5YzYUU&hl\nen&saX&ei\nRvBtUIWiK6PY2gX0j4DIAQ&ved0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v\nonepage&qBoth%20Catholics%20and%20Protestants%20have%20the%20same%2027-book%20New%20Testament%20Canon&f\nfalse] Encyclopedia of Catholicism, Frank K. Flinn, Infobase Publishing, Jan 1, 2007, p. 103\n\nThe New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in , \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God\".\n\nEthiopian Orthodox canon\n\nThe Canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches. There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to Enoch and Jubilees which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament, also Greek Ezra First and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.\n\nDivine inspiration\n\nThe Second Epistle to Timothy says that \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\". () Various related but distinguishable views on divine inspiration include:\n\n* the view of the Bible as the inspired word of God: the belief that God, through the Holy Spirit, intervened and influenced the words, message, and collation of the BibleRice, John R. – Our God-Breathed Book: The Bible – , Sword of the Lord Publishers, 1969, pp 68–88.\n* the view that the Bible is also infallible, and incapable of error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in historic or scientific matters\n* the view that the Bible represents the inerrant word of God, without error in any aspect, spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans\n\nWithin these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate. \"Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture.\" Fundamentalist Christians are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader.\"Beyond Biblical Literalism and Inerrancy: Conservative Protestants and the Hermeneutic Interpretation of Scripture\", John Bartkowski, Sociology of Religion, 57, 1996.\n\nJewish antiquity attests to belief in sacred texts,Philo of Alexandria, De vita Moysis 3.23.Josephus, Contra Apion 1.8. and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention divine agency in relation to its writings. In their book A General Introduction to the Bible, Norman Geisler and William Nix write: \"The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record.\"Norman L. Geisler, William E. Nix. A General Introduction to the Bible. Moody Publishers, 1986, p. 86.  Most evangelical biblical scholarsFor example, see Leroy Zuck, Roy B. Zuck. Basic Bible Interpretation. Chariot Victor Pub, 1991, p. 68. Roy B. Zuck, Donald Campbell. Basic Bible Interpretation. Victor, 2002. Norman L. Geisler. Inerrancy. Zondervan, 1980, p. 294.  associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy which asserted that inspiration applied only to the autographic text of Scripture. Among adherents of Biblical literalism, a minority, such as followers of the King-James-Only Movement, extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular translation.\n\nVersions and translations\n\nThe original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the Targum Onkelos, an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.\n\nThe primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.\n\nThe earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or Vetus Latina, which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAccording to the Latin Decretum Gelasianum (also known as the Gelasian Decree),  thought to be of  a 6th-century document of uncertain authorship and of pseudepigraphal papal authority  (variously ascribed to Pope Gelasius I,  Pope Damasus I, or Pope Hormisdas)  but reflecting the views of the Roman Church by that period, the  Council of Rome  in 382 AD under Pope Damasus I  (366–383) assembled  a list of books of the Bible. Damasus commissioned Saint Jerome to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the Latin Vulgate Bible, in the fourth century AD (although Jerome expressed in his prologues to most  deuterocanonical  books  that they were  non-canonical).[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml Prologues of Saint Jerome,Latin text] In 1546, at the Council of Trent, Jerome's Vulgate translation was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the Latin Church.\n\nSince the Protestant Reformation, Bible translations for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organizations such as Wycliffe Bible Translators, New Tribes Mission and Bible societies.\n\nViews\n\nJohn Riches, professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the Bible:\n\nIt has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.\n\nOther religions\n\nIn Islam, the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding revelation from God; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: tahrif); which necessitated the giving of the Qur'an to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, to correct this deviation.\n\nMembers of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, Rastafaris view the Bible as essential to their religionBecoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica. p. 171, Charles Price. 2009 and Unitarian Universalists view it as \"one of many important religious texts\".Unitarian Universalism. p. 42, Zondervan Publishing, 2009\n\nBiblical studies\n\nBiblical criticism refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have translation errors.\n\nHigher criticism\n\nIn the 17th century Thomas Hobbes collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher Baruch Spinoza published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was \"clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses . . .\"[https://books.google.com/books?idgvrcHyusPbMC&pg\nPA121&lpgPA121&dq\nclearer+than+the+sun+at+noon+that+the+Pentateuch+was+not+written+by+Moses&sourcebl&ots\ntIddvOc2Nv&siglHzsQ_BeqBPGxjK2Z0g94THacK0&hl\nen&saX&ei\no3BWUMr3IInc9ATGx4HoBw&ved0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v\nonepage&qclearer%20than%20the%20sun%20at%20noon%20that%20the%20Pentateuch%20was%20not%20written%20by%20Moses&f\nfalse Ten More Amazing Discoveries By George Potter], Cedar Fort,  2005, p. 121\n\nArchaeological and historical research\n\nBiblical archaeology is the archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the \"New Testament\"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes biblical maximalism which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible to be a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE Babylonian captivity have a basis in history.\n\nThe historicity of the biblical account of the history of ancient Israel and Judah of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the United Monarchy (10th century BCE) and the historicity of David is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the Tel Dan Stele, can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the Exodus from Egypt in the Torah, and the migration to the Promised Land and the period of Judges are not considered historical in scholarship.* \n\nBible Museum \n\nBible Museums of the United States \n\n1) On December 1, 2017, the Museum of the Bible opened in Washington D.C.

Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where \"separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.\"Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.\nBy the fourteenth century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium started to  employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.\nDemand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators. These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day.\n\nThe manuscript was \"sent to the rubricator, who added (in red or other colours) the titles, headlines, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.\"  In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would \"undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe's agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.\"\n\nFile:Bible chartraine - BNF Lat116 f193.jpg|Bible from 1150, from Scriptorium de Chartres, Christ with angels\nFile:Bible of St Louis detail.jpg|Blanche of Castile and Louis IX of France Bible, 13th century\nFile:Maciejowski Bible Leaf 37 3.jpg| Maciejowski Bible, Leaf 37, the 3rd image, Abner (in the center in green) sends Michal back to David.\nFile:Jephthah's daughter laments - Maciejowski Bible.JPG|Jephthah's daughter laments – Maciejowski Bible (France, ca. 1250)\nFile:Whore-babylon-luther-bible-1534.jpg|Coloured version of the Whore of Babylon illustration from Martin Luther's 1534 translation of the Bible\nFile:Malnazar - Bible - Google Art Project.jpg|An Armenian Bible, illuminated by Malnazar\nFile:Foster Bible Pictures 0031-1.jpg|Fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah, Foster Bible\nFile:Kennicott Bible 305r.l.jpg|Jonah being swallowed by the fish, Kennicott Bible, 1476.
