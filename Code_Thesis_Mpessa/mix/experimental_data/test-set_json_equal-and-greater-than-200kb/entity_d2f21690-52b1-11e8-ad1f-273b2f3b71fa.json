  "textBody" : "ChristianityFrom Ancient Greek  Khristós (Latinized as Christus), translating Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ, Māšîăḥ, meaning \"the anointed one\", with the Latin suffixes -ian and -itas. is a universalising Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life, teachings, and miracles  of Jesus of Nazareth, known by Christians as the Christ, or \"Messiah\", who is the focal point of the Christian faiths. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers,33.39% of ~7.2 billion world population (under the section 'People')  or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians make up a majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. They believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization.Religions in Global Society – Page 146, Peter Beyer – 2006Cambridge University Historical Series, An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects, p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.Caltron J.H Hayas, Christianity and Western Civilization (1953), Stanford University Press, p.2: \"That certain distinctive features of our Western civilization — the civilization of western Europe and of America— have been shaped chiefly by Judaeo – Graeco – Christianity, Catholic and Protestant.\"Horst Hutter, University of New York, Shaping the Future: Nietzsche's New Regime of the Soul And Its Ascetic Practices (2004), p.111:three mighty founders of Western culture, namely Socrates, Jesus, and Plato.Fred Reinhard Dallmayr, Dialogue Among Civilizations: Some Exemplary Voices (2004), p.22: Western civilization is also sometimes described as \"Christian\" or \"Judaeo- Christian\" civilization.\n\nChristianity grew out of Judaism and began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century.Esler. The Early Christian World. p. 157f. Originating in the Roman province of Judea, it quickly spread to Europe, Syria, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Transcaucasia, Egypt, Ethiopia and the Indian subcontinent, and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire.Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm Catholic encyclopedia] New AdventMcManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, pp. 301–03. Following the Age of Discovery, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization.\n\nChristian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, descended into hell, and rose from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins. The creeds further maintain that Jesus physically ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers. His incarnation, earthly ministry, crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as \"the gospel\", meaning \"good news\".\"Good news\" is a translation of the Ancient Greek term  euangélion, from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive. The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus' life and teaching, four of which—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible, as established by the 5th century for the ancient undivided Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions before the East–West Schism.\n\nThroughout its history, Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations. Worldwide, the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism. The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East–West Schism of 1054. Protestantism came into existence in the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, splitting from the Catholic Church.\n\nBeliefs\n\nThere are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible and sacred tradition on which Christianity is based.Olson, The Mosaic of Christian Belief. Because of these irreconcilable differences in theology and a lack of consensus on the core tenets of Christianity, Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox often deny that members of certain other branches are Christians.\n\nCreeds\n\nConcise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creeds (from Latin credo, meaning \"I believe\"). They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.\n\nMany evangelical Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. The Baptists have been non-creedal \"in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another.\"Avis, Paul (2002) The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions, SPCK, London,  paperback Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the Restoration Movement, such as the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada and the Churches of Christ.White, Howard A. [http://www.appiusforum.net/restoration.html The History of the Church].Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005, \n\nThe Apostles' Creed is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of Christian faith. It is used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of Western Christian tradition, including the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Western Rite Orthodoxy. It is also used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.Pelikan/Hotchkiss, Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition.\n\nIts main points include:\n* Belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit\n* The death, descent into hell, resurrection and ascension of Christ\n* The holiness of the Church and the communion of saints\n* Christ's second coming, the Day of Judgement and salvation of the faithful.\n\nThe Nicene Creed was formulated, largely in response to Arianism, at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively Encyclopedia of Religion, \"Arianism\". and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the First Council of Ephesus in 431.Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm \"Council of Ephesus\"].\n\nThe Chalcedonian Definition, or Creed of Chalcedon, developed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451,Christian History Institute, [https://archive.is/20080106201425/http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2003/10/daily-10-08-2003.shtml First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon]. though rejected by the Oriental Orthodox churches, taught Christ \"to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably\": one divine and one human, and that both natures, while perfect in themselves, are nevertheless also perfectly united into one person.Pope Leo I, [http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/4ecumen2.htm Letter to Flavian]\n\nThe Athanasian Creed, received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: \"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance.\"Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]\".\n\nMost Christians (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Protestant alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.\n\nJesus\n\nThe central tenet of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah (Christ). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was anointed by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from the contemporary Jewish concept. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Metzger/Coogan, Oxford Companion to the Bible, pp. 513, 649.\n\nWhile there have been many theological disputes over the nature of Jesus over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and \"true God and true man\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not sin. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the New Testament, he rose from the dead,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  ascended to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the FatherWikisource:Nicene Creed and will ultimately return to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy, including the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and final establishment of the Kingdom of God.\n\nAccording to the canonical gospels of Matthew and Luke, Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although infancy gospels were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the gospels contained within the New Testament, because that part of his life is believed to be most important. The biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: his baptism, miracles, preaching, teaching and deeds.\n\nDeath and resurrection\n\nChristians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see 1 Corinthians 15) and the most important event in history.Hanegraaff. Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity. Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based. According to the New Testament, Jesus was crucified, died a physical death, was buried within a tomb and rose from the dead three days later.  \n\nThe New Testament mentions several resurrection appearances of Jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples, including \"more than five hundred brethren at once\", before Jesus' Ascension to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during Holy Week which includes Good Friday and Easter Sunday.\n\nThe death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in Christian theology, partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal life., , , , , , and \n\nChristian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord. Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.Fuller, The Foundations of New Testament Christology, p. 11. Some liberal Christians do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,A Jesus Seminar conclusion: \"in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on visionary experiences of Peter, Paul, and Mary.\"Funk. The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?. seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing myth. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues.Lorenzen. Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today, p. 13. Paul the Apostle, an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, \"If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.\" Ball/Johnsson (ed.). The Essential Jesus.\n\nSalvation\n\nPaul the Apostle, like Jews and Roman pagans of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity and eternal life. For Paul, the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus: Gentiles who are \"Christ's\" are, like Israel, descendants of Abraham and \"heirs according to the promise\". Wright, N.T. What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity? (Oxford, 1997), p. 121. The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the \"mortal bodies\" of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the \"children of God\" and were therefore no longer \"in the flesh\". \n\nModern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' substitutionary death and resurrection. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org] Martin Luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by God's grace, sometimes defined as \"unmerited favor\", even apart from baptism.\n\nChristians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self-redemption, but that sanctifying grace is irresistible.Westminster Confession, [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 Chapter X] ;Spurgeon, [http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism] . In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Arminian Protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in Jesus.\n\nTrinity\n\nTrinity refers to the teaching that the one GodChristianity's status as monotheistic is affirmed in, among other sources, the Catholic Encyclopedia (article \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]\"); William F. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity; H. Richard Niebuhr; About.com, [http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/monotheisticreligions/ Monotheistic Religion resources]; Kirsch, God Against the Gods; Woodhead, An Introduction to Christianity; The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia [http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0833762.html Monotheism]; The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071212011435/http://www.bartleby.com/59/5/monotheism.html monotheism]; New Dictionary of Theology, [http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_NDCT_Paul.htm Paul], pp. 496–99; Meconi. \"Pagan Monotheism in Late Antiquity\". p. 111f. comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons; the Father, the Son (incarnate in Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit. Together, these three persons are sometimes called the Godhead,Kelly. Early Christian Doctrines. pp. 87–90.Alexander. New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. p. 514f.McGrath. Historical Theology. p. 61. although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.Metzger/Coogan. Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 782. In the words of the Athanasian Creed, an early statement of Christian belief, \"the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God\".Kelly. The Athanasian Creed. They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation. While some Christians also believe that God appeared as the Father in the Old Testament, it is agreed that he appeared as the Son in the New Testament, and will still continue to manifest as the Holy Spirit in the present. But still, God still existed as three persons in each of these times.Oxford, \"Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg1207 However, traditionally there is a belief that it was the Son who appeared in the Old Testament because, for example, when the Trinity is depicted in art, the Son typically has the distinctive appearance, a cruciform halo identifying Christ, and in depictions of the Garden of Eden this looks forward to an Incarnation yet to occur. In some Early Christian sarcophagi the Logos is distinguished with a beard, \"which allows him to appear ancient, even preexistent.\"Heidi J. Hornik and Mikeal Carl Parsons, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nBmWpMKaDBVUC&pg=PA34 Interpreting Christian Art: Reflections on Christian art], Mercer University Press, 2003, , pp. 32–35.\n\nThe Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325, Christianity advocatedExamples of ante-Nicene statements:\n\n the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.\nFowler. World Religions: An Introduction for Students. p. 58.\n\nAccording to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in Western Christian theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three \"persons\" are each eternal and omnipotent. Other Christian religions including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others do not share those views on the Trinity.\n\nThe Latin word trias, from which trinity is derived, is first seen in the works of Theophilus of Antioch. He wrote of \"the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)\".Theophilus of Antioch Apologia ad Autolycum II 15 The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in Tertullian.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 50.Tertullian De Pudicitia chapter 21 In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of Origen.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 53.\n\nTrinitarians\n\nTrinitarianism denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the Trinity. Almost all Christian denominations and churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words \"Trinity\" and \"Triune\" do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of Tritheism), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father (Arianism). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.Moltman, Jurgen. The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God. Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. \n\nNontrinitarianism\n\nNontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as adoptionism or modalism, existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about Christology.Harnack, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]. Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, among groups with Unitarian theology in the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century,Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p.135 \"Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity\" in the 18th-century Enlightenment and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century.\n\nScriptures\n\nChristianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the biblical canon, the Old Testament and the New Testament, as the inspired word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in  is theopneustos, which literally means \"God-breathed\".\n\nSome believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles inerrant. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the King James Version.(§105–108)Second Helvetic Confession, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God]Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html online text] Another closely related view is Biblical infallibility or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography or science.\n\nThe books of the Bible accepted by the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches vary somewhat, with Jews accepting only the Hebrew Bible as canonical; there is however substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of traditions, and of the councils that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the Tanakh, the canon of the Hebrew Bible. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the Deuterocanonical Books as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the Septuagint, but are regarded by Protestants to be apocryphal. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.Metzger/Coogan, Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 39. The New Testament, originally written in Koine Greek, contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.\n\nModern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible. While the Authorized King James Version is held to by many because of its striking English prose, in fact it was translated from the Erasmus Greek Bible which in turn \"was based on a single 12th Century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us\".Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). Misquoting Jesus: the story behind who changed the Bible and why. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco  pages 209, 183 Much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text. Another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries. The injunction that women \"be silent and submissive\" in 1 Timothy 2 is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of Paul, a similar phrase in 1 Corinthians 14, which is thought to be by Paul, appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copyist. Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair \"when they pray or prophesies\", contradict this verse.\n\nA final issue with the Bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the New Testament. Other Gospels have now been recovered, such as those found near Nag Hammadi in 1945, and while some of these texts are quite different from what Christians have been used to, it should be understood that some of this newly recovered Gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with, or even earlier than, the New Testament Gospels. The core of the Gospel of Thomas, in particular, may date from as early as AD 50 (although some major scholars contest this early dating), and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical Gospels, texts that are mentioned in Luke 1:1–2. The Gospel of Thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical Gospels—verse 113, for example (\"The Father's Kingdom is spread out upon the earth, but people do not see it\"), is reminiscent of Luke 17:20–21—and the Gospel of John, with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed Gnosticism, has recently been seen as a possible response to the Gospel of Thomas, a text that is commonly labelled proto-Gnostic. Scholarship, then, is currently exploring the relationship in the Early Church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other, by analyzing new-found texts, by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny, and by an examination of the passage of New Testament texts to canonical status.\n\nCatholic interpretation\n\nIn antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in Alexandria and Antioch. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by Origen, tended to read Scripture allegorically, while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called theoria) could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.Kelly. Early Christian Doctrines. pp. 69–78.\n\nCatholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture § 115–118]. \n\nThe literal sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The spiritual sense is further subdivided into:\n* The allegorical sense, which includes typology. An example would be the parting of the Red Sea being understood as a \"type\" (sign) of baptism.\n* The moral sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.\n* The anagogical sense, which applies to eschatology, eternity and the consummation of the world\n\nRegarding exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:\n* The injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the literalThomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm \"Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses\"] Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116] \n* That the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly heldSecond Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html Dei Verbum (V.19)] .\n* That scripture must be read within the \"living Tradition of the whole Church\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III \"The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture\" § 113].  and\n* That \"the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome\".Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III \"The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith\" § 85]. \n\nProtestant interpretation\n\nClarity of Scripture\n\nProtestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and revealed all truth necessary for salvation. This concept is known as sola scriptura. Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or \"perspicuous\"), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be \"enveloped in darkness\". He advocated \"one definite and simple understanding of Scripture\". John Calvin wrote, \"all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light\".John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vii.iv.iv.html  Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles 2 Peter 3:14–18] The Second Helvetic Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zürich (successor to Protestant reformer Zwingli) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.\n\nOriginal intended meaning of Scripture\n\nProtestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the historical-grammatical method.Sproul. Knowing Scripture, pp. 45–61; Bahnsen, [http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics (article 6)]. The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in Biblical hermeneutics to find the intended original meaning in the text. This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations. The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text. The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said: \"A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture.\" (1890 edition page 103, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFy9VAAAAMAAJ&focussearchwithinvolume&q\n%22fundamental+principle%22 view1], [https://books.google.com/books?idFy9VAAAAMAAJ&focus\nsearchwithinvolume&q%22neglect+this+principle%22 view2]) Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Taken together, both define the term (Biblical) hermeneutics.\n\nSome Protestant interpreters make use of typology.e.g., in his [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhcw/matthew/1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.1). Matthew Henry interprets the twin sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and Jewish Christians. For a contemporary treatment, see Glenny, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion].\n\nEschatology\n\nThe end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the Tribulation, death and the afterlife, the Rapture, the Second Coming of Jesus, Resurrection of the Dead, Heaven and Hell, Millennialism, the Last Judgment, the end of the world and the New Heavens and New Earth.\n\nChristians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the end of time after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the Kingdom of God in fulfillment of scriptural prophecies.Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis] questions 69 through 99\n\nDeath and afterlife\n\nMost Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or eternal damnation. This includes the general judgement at the resurrection of the dead as well as the belief (held by Roman Catholics,Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]\".Ott, Grundriß der Dogmatik, p. 566. OrthodoxDavid Moser, [http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead].Ken Collins, [http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?]. and most Protestants) in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of purgatory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence. Those who have attained this goal are called saints (Latin sanctus, \"holy\").Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]\".\n\nSome Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to mortalism, the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to Annihilationism, the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.\"The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, \"the dead are conscious of nothing.\" What is God's Purpose for the Earth?\" Official Site of Jehovah's Witnesses. Watchtower, 15 July 2002.\n\nWorship\n\nJustin Martyr described 2nd-century Christian liturgy in his First Apology (c. 150) to Emperor Antoninus Pius, and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:\n\nAnd on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html First Apology] §LXVII\n\nThus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an annual cycle, using a book called a lectionary. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a sermon, or homily. There are a variety of congregational prayers, including thanksgiving, confession and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The Lord's Prayer, or Our Father, is regularly prayed.\n\nSome groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between \"High\" church services, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and \"Low\" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. Seventh-day Adventists meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. Charismatic or Pentecostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. Quakers sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.\n\nSome evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music, dancing and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a minister, preacher, or pastor. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only a cappella music, either on principle (for example, many Churches of Christ object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).\n\nNearly all forms of churchmanship celebrate the Eucharist (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples bread, saying, \"This is my body\", and gave them wine saying, \"This is my blood\".Ignazio Silone, Bread and Wine (1937). Some Christian denominations practice closed communion. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of mortal sin. Most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.\n\nWorship can be varied for special events like baptisms or weddings in the service or significant feast days. In the early church, Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called Sunday school or Sabbath school (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).\n\nSacraments\n\nIn Christian belief and practice, a sacrament is a rite, instituted by Christ, that confers grace, constituting a sacred mystery. The term is derived from the Latin word sacramentum, which was used to translate the Greek word for mystery. Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.Cross/Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. p. 1435f.\n\nThe most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are Baptism and the Eucharist (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: Confirmation (Chrismation in the Orthodox tradition), Holy orders (ordination), Penance (or Confession), Anointing of the Sick and Matrimony (see Christian views on marriage).\n\nTaken together, these are the Seven Sacraments as recognized by churches in the High Church tradition—notably Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Independent Catholic, Old Catholic, many Anglicans and some Lutherans. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology. Christian denominations, such as Baptists, which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ordinances rather than sacraments.\n\nIn addition to this, the Church of the East has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick. These include Holy Leaven (Melka) and the sign of the cross.Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon.\n\nFile:Skondals kyrka 2005.jpg|Baptism, specifically infant baptism, in the Lutheran tradition\nFile:Исповедь берн собор.jpg|A penitent confessing his sins in a Ukrainian Catholic church\nFile:Methodistcommunion3.jpg|A Methodist minister celebrating the Eucharist\nFile:Anglican confirmation in Helsinki.jpg|Confirmation being administered in an Anglican church\nFile:Cheirotonia_Presbyter_1.jpeg|Ordination of a priest in the Eastern Orthodox tradition\nFile:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|Crowning during Holy Matrimony in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church\nFile:2017-04-12--Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction, on Holy Wednesday.jpg|Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction served on Great and Holy Wednesday\n\nLiturgical calendar\n\nRoman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the liturgical year. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of paraments and vestments for clergy, scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.\n\nWestern Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective rites. Calendars set aside holy days, such as solemnities which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus, Mary or the saints, and periods of fasting, such as Lent and other pious events such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.Hickman. Handbook of the Christian Year.\n\nSymbols\n\nChristianity has not generally practiced aniconism, or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, even if the early Jewish Christians sects, as well as some modern denominations, preferred to some extent not to use figures in their symbols, by invoking the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry.\n\nThe cross, which is today one of the most widely recognized symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX). Tertullian, in his book De Corona, tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.\" (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html De Corona, chapter 3]) Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the crucifix did not appear in use until the 5th century.Dilasser. The Symbols of the Church.\n\nAmong the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish or Ichthys seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century.Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]\". Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter (Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ), meaning, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.\n\nOther major Christian symbols include the chi-rho monogram, the dove (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the vine (symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.\n\nBaptism\n\nBaptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the Church. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. Others view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods are: by immersion; if immersion is total, by submersion; by affusion (pouring); and by aspersion (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of infant baptism;\"Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission\" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213] ); \"Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God\" ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] \"Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ\" ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit – The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)] ;\"As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away\" (William H. Brackney, [http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm Doing Baptism Baptist Style Believer's Baptism] ) the Orthodox Churches all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\"After the proclamation of faith, the baptismal water is prayed over and blessed as the sign of the goodness of God's creation. The person to be baptized is also prayed over and blessed with sanctified oil as the sign that his creation by God is holy and good. And then, after the solemn proclamation of \"Alleluia\" (God be praised), the person is immersed three times in the water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit\" ([http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID2&ID\n51 Orthodox Church in America: Baptism).]\"In the Orthodox Church we totally immerse, because such total immersion symbolizes death. What death? The death of the \"old, sinful man\". After Baptism we are freed from the dominion of sin, even though after Baptism we retain an inclination and tendency toward evil.\", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, article \"[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism Baptism] \". The Catholic Church also practices infant baptism,Catechism of the Catholic Church [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm#403 403], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm 1231, 1233, 1250, 1252]. usually by affusion, and utilizing the Trinitarian formula.Catechism of the Catholic Church [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#1240 1240].\n\nPrayer\n\nJesus' teaching on prayer in the Sermon on the Mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged. Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized. This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as genuflection or making the sign of the cross. Kneeling, bowing and prostrations (see also poklon) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony. At other times the older orans posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.\n\nIntercessory prayer is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the Apostle Peter on behalf of sick persons and by prophets of the Old Testament in favor of other people. In the Epistle of James, no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah. The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.\n\nThe ancient church, in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of (deceased) saints, and this remains the practice of most Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation, however, rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ. The reformer Huldrych Zwingli admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous.Madeleine Gray, The Protestant Reformation, (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church: \"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.\" The Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Church and Christological Councils\n\nChristianity began as a Jewish sect in the Levant of the middle east in the mid-1st century. Other than Second Temple Judaism, the primary religious influences of early Christianity are Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism.The term \"Christian\" (Greek ) was first used in reference to Jesus's disciples in the city of Antioch about 44 AD, meaning \"followers of Christ\". The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were \"brethren\", \"the faithful\", \"elect\", \"saints\", and \"believers\". The earliest recorded use of the term \"Christianity\" (Greek ) was by Ignatius of Antioch, around 100 AD. John Bowker states that Christian ideas such as \"angels, the end of the world, a final judgment, the resurrection and heaven and hell received form and substance from ... Zoroastrian beliefs\". Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the remaining Twelve Apostles, particularly Saint Peter, and Paul the Apostle, followed by the early bishops, whom Christians consider the successors of the Apostles.\n\nAccording to the Christian scriptures, Christians were from the beginning subject to persecution by some Jewish and Roman religious authorities, who disagreed with the apostles' teachings (See Split of early Christianity and Judaism). This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as Stephen and James, son of Zebedee. Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire, first in the year 64, when Emperor Nero blamed them for the Great Fire of Rome. According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that early Church leaders Peter and Paul of Tarsus were each martyred in Rome.\n\nFurther widespread persecutions of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under Decius and Diocletian. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the Church Fathers, and study of them is called Patristics. Notable early Fathers include Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Origen. However, Armenia is considered the first nation to accept Christianity in AD 301.\n\nKing Trdat IV made Christianity the state religion in Armenia between 301 and 314, it was not an entirely new religion in Armenia. It penetrated into the country from at least the third century, but may have been present even earlier.\n\nEnd of Roman persecution under Emperor Constantine (AD 313)\n\n \nState persecution ceased in the 4th century, when Constantine I issued an edict of toleration in 313. On 27 February 380, Emperor Theodosius I enacted a law establishing Nicene Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2], in: Bettenson. Documents of the Christian Church. p. 31. From at least the 4th century, Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization.Orlandis, A Short History of the Catholic Church (1993), preface.\n\nConstantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which sought to address the Arian heresy and formulated the Nicene Creed, which is still used by the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglican Communion and many Protestant churches. Nicaea was the first of a series of Ecumenical (worldwide) Councils which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning Christology.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 37f. The Assyrian Church of the East did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils, and are still separate today.\n\nThe presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st century in Egypt, and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around Carthage. Mark the Evangelist started the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in about AD 43.Eusebius of Caesarea, the author of Ecclesiastical History in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 AD. \"Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity\" Otto F.A. Meinardus p28. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity includes Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, Cyprian, Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo. The later rise of Islam in North Africa reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving only the Coptic Church in Egypt, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in the Horn of Africa and the Nubian Church in the Sudan (Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia).\n\nIn terms of prosperity and cultural life, the Byzantine Empire was one of the peaks in Christian history and Christian civilization,. and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth and culture.. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance..\n\nEarly Middle Ages\n\nWith the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the papacy became a political player, first visible in Pope Leo's diplomatic dealings with Huns and Vandals. The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. While Arianists instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see Massacre of Verden as example), Catholicism also spread among the Germanic peoples,Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 238–42. the Celtic and Slavic peoples, the Hungarians and the Baltic peoples. Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of Western civilization, at least since the 4th century.\n\nAround 500, St. Benedict set out his Monastic Rule, establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of monasteries. Monasticism became a powerful force throughout Europe, and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in Ireland, Scotland and Gaul, contributing to the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century.\n\nIn the 7th century Muslims conquered Syria (including Jerusalem), North Africa and Spain. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine empire in its decades long conflict with Persia.Mullin, 2008, p. 88. Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of Carolingian leaders, the papacy began to find greater political support in the Frankish Kingdom.Mullin, 2008, p. 93–4.\n\nThe Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. Pope Gregory the Great dramatically reformed ecclesiastical structure and administration.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 244–47. In the early 8th century, iconoclasm became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the Byzantine emperors. The Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, p. 260. In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of Cluny.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 278–81.\n\nHebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the Christian era.\n\nHigh and Late Middle Ages\n\nIn the west, from the 11th century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see University of Oxford, University of Paris and University of Bologna.) The traditional medieval universities—evolved from Catholic and Protestant church schools—then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as professionals. Prof. Walter Rüegg, editor of A History of the University in Europe, reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics, lawyers, civil servants and physicians.Rudy, The Universities of Europe, 1100–1914, p. 40\n\nOriginally teaching only theology, universities steadily added subjects including medicine, philosophy and law, becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 305, 312, 314f..\nThe university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting.Rüegg, Walter: \"Foreword. The University as a European Institution\", in: A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , pp. XIX–XX Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (Scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century AD.Riché, Pierre (1978): \"Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century\", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, , pp. 126–7, 282–98\n\nAccompanying the rise of the \"new towns\" throughout Europe, mendicant orders were founded, bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the FranciscansGonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86. and the DominicansGonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 305, 310f., 316f. founded by St. Francis and St. Dominic respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the Cistercians, whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and the building of the great European cathedrals.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 321–23, 365f.\n\nFrom 1095 under the pontificate of Urban II, the Crusades were launched.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 292–300. These were a series of military campaigns in the Holy Land and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I for aid against Turkish expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade.Riley-Smith. The Oxford History of the Crusades.\n\nOver a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a schism dividing it into a so-called Latin or Western Christian branch, the Roman Catholic Church,The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language and an Eastern, largely Greek, branch, the Orthodox Church. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical and doctrinal issues, most notably papal primacy of jurisdiction.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 91 The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence  (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various smaller eastern churches.\n\nBeginning around 1184, following the crusade against the Cathar heresy,Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 300, 304–05. various institutions, broadly referred to as the Inquisition, were established with the aim of suppressing heresy and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through conversion and prosecution.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.\n\nProtestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation\n\n15th-century Renaissance brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the Reformation, resulted in the splintering of the Western Christendom into several branches.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. p. 7. Martin Luther in 1517 protested against the sale of indulgences and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic doctrine.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. pp. 39, 55–61.\n\nOther reformers like Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Calvin, Knox and Arminius further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called Protestantism, which repudiated the primacy of the pope, the role of tradition, the seven sacraments and other doctrines and practices. The Reformation in England began in 1534, when King Henry VIII had himself declared head of the Church of England. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were dissolved.Schama. A History of Britain. pp. 306–10.\n\nThomas Müntzer, Andreas Karlstadt and other theologians perceived both the Roman Catholic Church and the confessions of the Magisterial Reformation as corrupted. Their activity brought about the Radical Reformation, which gave birth to various Anabaptist denominations.\n\nPartly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reform.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church, pp. 242–44. The Council of Trent clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. pp. 109–120.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThroughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of religious violence and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. Lutheranism spread into northern, central and eastern parts of present-day Germany, Livonia and Scandinavia. Anglicanism was established in England in 1534. Calvinism and its varieties (such as Presbyterianism) were introduced in Scotland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland and France. Arminianism gained followers in the Netherlands and Frisia. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of conflicts in which religion played a key factor. The Thirty Years' War, the English Civil War and the French Wars of Religion are prominent examples. These events intensified the Christian debate on persecution and toleration.A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689.\n\nPost-Enlightenment\n\nIn the era known as the Great Divergence, when in the West the Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific revolution brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political ideologies such as versions of socialism and liberalism. Events ranged from mere anti-clericalism to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the Dechristianisation during the French Revolution,Mortimer Chambers, The Western Experience (vol. 2) chapter 21. the Spanish Civil War and certain Marxist movements, especially the Russian Revolution and the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union under state atheism.Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011.Inside Central Asia: A Political and Cultural History, by Dilip Hiro. Penguin, 2009.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.494\"\n\nEspecially pressing in Europe was the formation of nation states after the Napoleonic era. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the University of Fribourg, looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic countries such as Belgium, Spain and to some extent Austria, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland, Ireland and Switzerland, all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in Germany, the Netherlands and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy, countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultramontanism, especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in England (to a much lesser extent), often forced Catholic churches, organizations and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the First Vatican Council, and in Germany would lead directly to the Kulturkampf, where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of Bismarck managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.\n\nChristian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic and Estonia, while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general, with the western civilization no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity.\n\nSome Europeans (including diaspora), Indigenous peoples of the Americas and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples' historical folk religions. Approximately 7.1 to 10% of Arabs are Christians, most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nDemographics\n\nWith around 2.4 billion adherents, split into three main branches of Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox, Christianity is the world's largest religion. The Christian share of the world's population has stood at around 33% for the last hundred years, which says that one in three persons on earth are Christians. This masks a major shift in the demographics of Christianity; large increases in the developing world have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world, mainly in Europe and North America.Werner Ustorf. \"A missiological postscript\", in McLeod and Ustorf (eds), The Decline of Christendom in (Western) Europe, 1750–2000, (Cambridge University Press, 2003) pp. 219–20. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, within the next four decades, Christians will remain the world's largest religion; and by 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.\n\nAs a percentage of Christians, the Catholic Church and Orthodoxy (both Eastern and Oriental) are declining, while Protestants and other Christians are on the rise.Johnstone, Patrick, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nAVzFAgAAQBAJ&pgPA109&dq\nchristianity+2050+protestant&hlpl&sa\nX&eiwQO7VJbSI8i1OraXgdAC&ved\n0CB8Q6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nchristianity%202050%20protestant&ffalse \"The Future of the Global Church: History, Trends and Possibilities\"], p. 100, fig 4.10 & 4.11Hillerbrand, Hans J., [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4tbFBQAAQBAJ&lpgPT3311&pg\nPT3311#vonepage&q&f\nfalse \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set\"], p. 1815, \"Observers carefully comparing all these figures in the total context will have observed the even more startling finding that for the first itime ever in the history of Protestantism, Wider Protestants will by 2050 have become almost exactly as numerous as Roman Catholics – each with just over 1.5 billion followers, or 17 percent of the world, with Protestants growing considerably faster than Catholics each year.\" The so-called popular ProtestantismA flexible term; defined as all forms of Protestantism with the notable exception of the historical denominations deriving directly from the Protestant Reformation. is one of the fastest growing religious categories in the world.\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion in Europe, the Americas and Southern Africa. In Asia, it is the dominant religion in Georgia, Armenia, East Timor and the Philippines.[http://www.britannica.com/eb/table?tocId=9394911 Encyclopædia Britannica] table of religions, by region. Retrieved November 2007.  However, it is declining in many areas including the Northern and Western United States, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), northern Europe (including Great Britain, Scandinavia and other places), France, Germany, the Canadian provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, and parts of Asia (especially the Middle East – due to the Christian emigration,Barrett/Kurian.World Christian Encyclopedia, p. 139 (Britain), 281 (France), 299 (Germany). South Korea, Taiwan, and Macau).\n\nThe Christian population is not decreasing in Brazil, the Southern United States and the province of Alberta, Canada, but the percentage is decreasing. In countries such as Australia and New Zealand,[http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx Table 28, 2006 Census Data – QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Tables].  the Christian population are declining in both numbers and percentage.\n\nDespite the declining numbers, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western World, where 70% are Christians. A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that 76.2% of Europeans, 73.3% in Oceania and about 86.0% in the Americas (90.0% in Latin America and 77.4% in North America) identified themselves as Christians. By 2010 about 157 countries and territories in the world had Christian majorities.\n\nHowever, there are many charismatic movements that have become well established over large parts of the world, especially Africa, Latin America and Asia.David Stoll, \"Is Latin America Turning Protestant?\" published Berkeley: University of California Press. 1990 Since 1900, primarily due to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported Evangelical Protestants grew three times the world's population rate, and twice that of Islam.  St. Mary's University study estimated about 10.2 million Muslim convert to Christianity in 2015. as well a significant numbers of Muslims converts to Christianity in Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan Algeria,[http://www.christianaction.org.za/articles./MuslimsTurnToChrist.htm Muslims Turn to Christ – ChristianAction] Belgium, France, Germany, Iran, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Russia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, United States, and Central Asia. It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in India (mostly Hindus), and Malaysia, Mongolia, Nigeria,[http://pewforum.org/world-affairs/countries/?countryID\n150 Religious Demographic Profiles – Pew Forum]  Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nIn most countries in the developed world, church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.Putnam, Democracies in Flux: The Evolution of Social Capital in Contemporary Society, p. 408. Some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions,McGrath, Christianity: An Introduction, p. xvi. while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general.Peter Marber, Money Changes Everything: How Global Prosperity Is Reshaping Our Needs, Values and Lifestyles, p. 99. Europe's Christian population, though in decline, still constitutes the largest geographical component of the religion.Philip Jenkins God's Continent, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007,  p. 56 According to data from the 2012 European Social Survey, around a third of European Christians say they attend services once a month or more, Conversely about more than two-thirds of Latin American Christians and according to the World Values Survey about 90% of African Christians (in Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Zimbabwe) said they attended church regularly.\n\nChristianity, in one form or another, is the sole state religion of the following nations: Argentina (Roman Catholic), Tuvalu (Reformed), Tonga (Methodist), Norway (Lutheran),[http://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/080410/losere-band-men-fortsatt-statskirke Løsere bånd, men fortsatt statskirke] , ABC Nyheter[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8076910 Staten skal ikke lenger ansette biskoper], NRK Costa Rica (Roman Catholic), Kingdom of Denmark (Lutheran), England (Anglican), Georgia (Georgian Orthodox), Greece (Greek Orthodox), Iceland (Lutheran), Liechtenstein (Roman Catholic), Malta (Roman Catholic), Monaco (Roman Catholic), and Vatican City (Roman Catholic).\n\nThere are numerous other countries, such as Cyprus, which although do not have an established church, still give official recognition and support to a specific Christian denomination.\n\nFile:Christian world map.png|Countries with 50% or more Christians are colored purple while countries with 10% to 50% Christians are colored pink\nFile:Map of state religions.svg|Nations with Christianity as their state religion are in blue\nFile:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|Nations with Christianity as their state religion (detailed map; see legend for more)\nFile:Catholic population.svg|Distribution of Roman Catholics\nFile:Countries by percentage of Protestants (2010).svg|Distribution of Protestants\nFile:Eastern Orthodoxy by country.png|Distribution of Eastern Orthodox\nFile:Oriental Orthodoxy by country.png|Distribution of Oriental Orthodox\nFile:Other Christians by country.png|Other Christians by number: black - more than 10 million; red - more than 1 million\n\nMajor denominations\n\nThe three primary divisions of Christianity are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism. However, there are other present and historical Christian groups that do not fit neatly into one of these primary categories. The Nicene Creed is accepted as authoritative by most Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and major Protestant churches.\n\nThere is a diversity of doctrines and practices among groups calling themselves Christian. These groups are sometimes classified under denominations, though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system.Sydney E. Ahlstrom, characterized denominationalism in America as \"a virtual ecclesiology\" that \"first of all repudiates the insistences of the Roman Catholic church, the churches of the 'magisterial' Reformation, and of most sects that they alone are the true Church.\" ();\n*;\n*Wendell Winkler, [http://www.thebible.net/introchurch/ch4.html Christ's Church is not a Denomination];\n* A broader distinction that is sometimes drawn is between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, which has its origins in the East–West Schism (Great Schism) of the 11th century.\n\nIn addition to the Lutheran and Reformed (or Calvinist) branches of the Reformation, there is Anglicanism after the English Reformation. The Anabaptist tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history. Adventist, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal and other Protestant confessions arose in the following centuries.\n\nCatholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Church consists of those particular Churches, headed by bishops, in communion with the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, as its highest authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance.Second Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium] .Duffy, Saints and Sinners, p. 1. Like Eastern Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, through apostolic succession, traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ.Hitchcock, Geography of Religion, p. 281.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History, p. 11, 14. Catholics maintain that the \"one, holy, catholic and apostolic church\" founded by Jesus subsists fully in the Roman Catholic Church, but also acknowledges other Christian churches and communitiesSecond Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium] , chapter 2, paragraph 15.Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p3.htm#IV paragraph 865].  and works towards reconciliation among all Christians. The Catholic faith is detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.Marthaler, Introducing the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Traditional Themes and Contemporary Issues (1994), preface.\n\nThe 2,834 seesAnnuario Pontificio (2012), p. 1142. are grouped into 24 particular autonomous Churches (the largest of which being the Latin Church), each with its own distinct traditions regarding the liturgy and the administering the sacraments.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 71 With more than 1.1 billion baptized members, the Catholic Church is the largest Christian church and represents over half of all Christians as well as one sixth of the world's population.Central Intelligence Agency, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA World Factbook] (2007).Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html Religions by Adherents]Zenit.org, \"[http://www.zenit.org/article-18894?l\nenglish Number of Catholics and Priests Rises] \", 12 February 2007.\n\nEastern Orthodox Church\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church consists of those churches in communion with the Patriarchal Sees of the East, such as the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.Cross/Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, p. 1199. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through apostolic succession and has an episcopal structure, though the autonomy of its component parts is emphasized, and most of them are national churches. A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the Great Schism. Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity, with an estimated 225–300 million adherents.\n\nOriental Orthodoxy\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches (also called \"Old Oriental\" churches) are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—Nicaea, Constantinople and Ephesus—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon and instead espouse a Miaphysite christology. The Oriental Orthodox communion consists of six groups: Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (India) and Armenian Apostolic churches. These six churches, while being in communion with each other are completely independent hierarchically. These churches are generally not in communion with Eastern Orthodox Churches with whom they are in dialogue for erecting a communion.\n\nAssyrian Church of the East\n\nThe Assyrian Church of the East, with an unbroken patriarchate established in the 17th century, is an independent Eastern Christian denomination which claims continuity from the Church of the East - in parallel to the Catholic patriarchate established in the 16th century that evolved into the Chaldean Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope.\n\nProtestantism\n\nIn the 16th century, Martin Luther, and subsequently Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, inaugurated what has come to be called Protestantism. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as Lutherans. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the Reformed tradition.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. pp. 251–59. The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the Protestant Reformation, often followed by further divisions.\n\nIn the 18th century, for example, Methodism grew out of Anglican minister John Wesley's evangelical and revival movement. Several Pentecostal and non-denominational churches, which emphasize the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit, in turn grew out of Methodism. Because Methodists, Pentecostals and other evangelicals stress \"accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior\", which comes from Wesley's emphasis of the New Birth, they often refer to themselves as being born-again.\n\nEstimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Roman Catholicism in number of followers (although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination). Often that number is put at more than 800 million, corresponding to nearly 40% of world's Christians. The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e. Adventists, Anglicans, Baptists, Reformed (Calvinists),This branch was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed. It includes Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Lutherans, Methodists and Pentecostals. Nondenominational, evangelical, charismatic, neo-charismatic, independent and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/evangelical-churches World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches]: \"Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition \"per se\" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between \"evangelical\" and \"mainline\" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities.\"\n\nA special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the Church of England and organized in the Anglican Communion. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.Sykes/Booty/Knight. The Study of Anglicanism, p. 219. Some Anglicans consider their church a branch of the \"One Holy Catholic Church\" alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox.Gregory Hallam, [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism].Gregory Mathewes-Green, \"[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]\", Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim Vol. 2, No. 4. \n\nWhile Anglicans, Lutherans and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated in the Magisterial Reformation, other Protestant groups such as the Anabaptists originated in the Radical Reformation and are distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism; they believe in baptism only of adult believers — credobaptism. (Anabaptists are made up mostly of Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites and Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptist groups.) \n\nSome groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as \"Christians\" or \"born-again Christians\". They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communitiesConfessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to \"the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.\" (MacCulloch, The Reformation: A History, p. xxiv.) by calling themselves \"non-denominational\" or \"evangelical\". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.\n\nRestorationism\n\nThe Second Great Awakening, a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 91f. A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the Great Apostasy. In Asia, Iglesia ni Cristo is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.\n\nSome of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the Jehovah's Witnesses movement and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, the Seventh-day Adventists. Others, including the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Evangelical Christian Church in Canada,Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (2004)Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009) Churches of Christ, and the Christian churches and churches of Christ, have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the Christadelphians and Latter Day Saint movement. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.\n\nOther\n\nVarious smaller Independent Catholic communities, such as the Old Catholic Church, include the word Catholic in their title, and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the Catholic Church, but are no longer in full communion with the Holy See.\n\nEsoteric Christians regard Christianity as a mystery religion,Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion: Selected Papers Presented at the 17th Congress and profess the existence and possession of certain esoteric doctrines or practices,From the Greek ἐσωτερικός (esôterikos, \"inner\"). The term esotericism itself was coined in the 17th century. (Oxford English Dictionary Compact Edition, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 894.)Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Antoine Faivre, Roelof van den Broek, Jean-Pierre Brach, Dictionary of Gnosis & Western Esotericism, Brill 2005. hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of \"enlightened\", \"initiated\", or highly educated people. Some of the esoteric Christian institutions include the Rosicrucian Fellowship, the Anthroposophical Society and Martinism.\n\nMessianic Judaism (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. The movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s, and it blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of \"Yeshua\" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.\n\nChristian culture\n\nWestern culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and a large portion of the population of the Western hemisphere can be described as cultural Christians. The notion of \"Europe\" and the \"Western World\" has been intimately connected with the concept of \"Christianity and Christendom\" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.\n\nThough Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the Greek and Roman empires, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Europe. Until the Age of Enlightenment, Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science. Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into Christian philosophy, Christian art, Christian music, Christian literature etc.\n\nChristianity has had a significant impact on education as the church created the bases of the Western system of education,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67592/Forms-of-Christian-education Encyclopædia Britannica] Forms of Christian education and was the sponsor of founding universities in the Western world; as the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting. Historically, Christianity has often been a patron of science and medicine. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many Catholic clergy;Susan Elizabeth Hough, Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man, Princeton University Press, 2007, , [https://books.google.com/books?id\nrvmDeAxEiO8C&pgPA68 p. 68.] Jesuits in particular,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/302999/Jesuit Encyclopædia Britannica] Jesuit have been active in the sciences throughout history and have made significant contributions to the development of science.Wallace, William A. (1984). Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science. N.J.: Princeton University Press. Protestantism also has had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.Sztompka, 2003 The Civilizing influence of Christianity includes social welfare,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67594/Church-and-social-welfare Encyclopædia Britannica] Church and social welfare founding hospitals,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67597/Care-for-the-sick Encyclopædia Britannica] Care for the sick economics (as the Protestant work ethic),[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67599/Property-poverty-and-the-poor Encyclopædia Britannica] Property, poverty, and the poor, politics,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67577/Church-and-state Encyclopædia Britannica] Church and state architecture,Sir Banister Fletcher, History of Architecture on the Comparative Method. literature,Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries\", The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp. 409–445 (416, table 1) personal hygiene,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nvcdEs3EAAkUC&printsecfrontcover&dq\nChristianity+in+Action:+The+History+of+the+International&hlit&sa\nX&ved0ahUKEwiN5eGe-KDKAhWFXhQKHe_aBdkQ6AEIHTAA#v\nonepage&qChristianity%20in%20Action%3A%20The%20History%20of%20the%20International&f\nfalse Christianity in Action: The History of the International Salvation Army] p.16 and family life.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67603/The-tendency-to-spiritualize-and-individualize-marriage Encyclopædia Britannica] The tendency to spiritualize and individualize marriage\n\nEastern Christians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the reign of the Ummayad and the Abbasid by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic.Hill, Donald.

According to 100 Years of Nobel Prizes a review of Nobel prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that (65.4%) of Nobel Prizes Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference.Baruch A. Shalev, 100 Years of Nobel Prizes (2003), Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, p.57: between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 654 Laureates belong to 28 different religions. Most (65.4%) have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. \n\nPostchristianityG.C. Oosthuizen. Postchristianity in Africa. C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd (31 December 1968).  is the term for the decline of Christianity, particularly in Europe, Canada, Australia and to a minor degree the Southern Cone, in the 20th and 21st centuries, considered in terms of postmodernism. It refers to the loss of Christianity's monopoly on values and world view in historically Christian societies.\n\nCultural Christians are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the popular culture, art, music and so on related to it. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.\n\nEcumenism\n\nChristian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th century, Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, pp. 581–84. One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the World Evangelical Alliance founded in 1846 in London or the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the World Council of Churches founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the National Council of Churches in Australia which includes Roman Catholics.\n\nThe other way was institutional union with United and uniting churches, a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany. Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada,McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 413f. and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia. The Church of South India was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 498.\n\nThe ecumenical, monastic Taizé Community is notable for being composed of more than one hundred brothers from Protestant and Catholic traditions. The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, France, is named the \"Church of Reconciliation\". The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young pilgrims annually.Oxford, \"Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg. 307.\n \nSteps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their Great Schism in 1054;McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 373. the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 583. and some Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches signing the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation. In 2006, the World Methodist Council, representing all Methodist denominations, adopted the declaration.\n\nCriticism and apologetics \n\nCriticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the Apostolic Age, with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes (e.g.  and ).International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982  page 175 In the 2nd century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135 by James D. G. Dunn 1999  pages 112–113 Additionally a sacrifice to remove sins in advance, for everyone or as a human being, did not fit to the Jewish sacrifice ritual, furthermore God is said to judge people on their deeds instead of their beliefs.Asher Norman Twenty-six Reasons why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus Feldheim Publishers 2007  page 11Keith Akers The Lost Religion of Jesus: Simple Living and Nonviolence in Early Christianity Lantern Books 2000  page 103 One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher Celsus, who wrote The True Word, a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society. In response, the church father Origen published his treatise Contra Celsum, or Against Celsus, a seminal work of Christian apologetics, which systematically addressed Celsus's criticisms and brought Christianity a level of academic respectability.\n\nBy the 3rd century, criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it. Wild rumors about Christians were widely circulated, claiming that they were atheists and that, as part of their rituals, they devoured human infants and engaged in incestuous orgies. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry wrote the fifteen-volume Adversus Christianos as a comprehensive attack on Christianity, in part building on the teachings of Plotinus.The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 1 by George Thomas Kurian and James Smith 2010  page 527Apologetic Discourse and the Scribal Tradition by Wayne Campbell Kannaday 2005  pages 32–33\n\nBy the 12th century, the Mishneh Torah (i.e., Rabbi Moses Maimonides) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus who had a physical body.A Dictionary Of Jewish-Christian Relations by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005  page 168 In the 19th century, Nietzsche began to write a series of polemics on the \"unnatural\" teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996  pages 90–93 In the 20th century, the philosopher Bertrand Russell expressed his criticism of Christianity in Why I Am Not a Christian, formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999  pages 77–87\n\nCriticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. Jewish and Muslim theologians criticize the doctrine of the Trinity held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three Gods, running against the basic tenet of monotheism.Christianity: An Introduction by Alister E. McGrath 2006  pp. 125–126. New Testament scholar Robert M. Price has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in \"The Christ Myth Theory and its problems\".\" The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems \", published 2011 by American Atheist press, Cranford, New Jersey, \n\nChristian apologetics aims to present a rational basis for Christianity. The word \"apologetic\" comes from the Greek word \"apologeomai\", meaning \"in defense of\". Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher Thomas Aquinas presented five arguments for God's existence in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles was a major apologetic work. Another famous apologist, G. K. Chesterton, wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.(http://www.chesterton.org/why-i-believe-in-christianity/) He pointed to the advance of Christian civilizations as proof of its practicality. The physicist and priest John Polkinghorne, in his Questions of Truth discusses the subject of religion and science, a topic that other Christian apologists such as Ravi Zacharias, John Lennox and William Lane Craig have engaged, with the latter two men opining that the inflationary Big Bang model is evidence for the existence of God.",

    "aggregatedText" : "ChristianityFrom Ancient Greek  Khristós (Latinized as Christus), translating Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ, Māšîăḥ, meaning \"the anointed one\", with the Latin suffixes -ian and -itas. is a universalising Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life, teachings, and miracles  of Jesus of Nazareth, known by Christians as the Christ, or \"Messiah\", who is the focal point of the Christian faiths. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers,33.39% of ~7.2 billion world population (under the section 'People')  or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians make up a majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. They believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization.Religions in Global Society – Page 146, Peter Beyer – 2006Cambridge University Historical Series, An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects, p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.Caltron J.H Hayas, Christianity and Western Civilization (1953), Stanford University Press, p.2: \"That certain distinctive features of our Western civilization — the civilization of western Europe and of America— have been shaped chiefly by Judaeo – Graeco – Christianity, Catholic and Protestant.\"Horst Hutter, University of New York, Shaping the Future: Nietzsche's New Regime of the Soul And Its Ascetic Practices (2004), p.111:three mighty founders of Western culture, namely Socrates, Jesus, and Plato.Fred Reinhard Dallmayr, Dialogue Among Civilizations: Some Exemplary Voices (2004), p.22: Western civilization is also sometimes described as \"Christian\" or \"Judaeo- Christian\" civilization.\n\nChristianity grew out of Judaism and began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century.Esler. The Early Christian World. p. 157f. Originating in the Roman province of Judea, it quickly spread to Europe, Syria, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Transcaucasia, Egypt, Ethiopia and the Indian subcontinent, and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire.Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm Catholic encyclopedia] New AdventMcManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, pp. 301–03. Following the Age of Discovery, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization.\n\nChristian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, descended into hell, and rose from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins. The creeds further maintain that Jesus physically ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers. His incarnation, earthly ministry, crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as \"the gospel\", meaning \"good news\".\"Good news\" is a translation of the Ancient Greek term  euangélion, from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive. The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus' life and teaching, four of which—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible, as established by the 5th century for the ancient undivided Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions before the East–West Schism.\n\nThroughout its history, Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations. Worldwide, the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism. The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East–West Schism of 1054. Protestantism came into existence in the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, splitting from the Catholic Church.\n\nBeliefs\n\nThere are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible and sacred tradition on which Christianity is based.Olson, The Mosaic of Christian Belief. Because of these irreconcilable differences in theology and a lack of consensus on the core tenets of Christianity, Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox often deny that members of certain other branches are Christians.\n\nCreeds\n\nConcise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creeds (from Latin credo, meaning \"I believe\"). They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.\n\nMany evangelical Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. The Baptists have been non-creedal \"in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another.\"Avis, Paul (2002) The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions, SPCK, London,  paperback Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the Restoration Movement, such as the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada and the Churches of Christ.White, Howard A. [http://www.appiusforum.net/restoration.html The History of the Church].Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005, \n\nThe Apostles' Creed is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of Christian faith. It is used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of Western Christian tradition, including the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Western Rite Orthodoxy. It is also used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.Pelikan/Hotchkiss, Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition.\n\nIts main points include:\n* Belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit\n* The death, descent into hell, resurrection and ascension of Christ\n* The holiness of the Church and the communion of saints\n* Christ's second coming, the Day of Judgement and salvation of the faithful.\n\nThe Nicene Creed was formulated, largely in response to Arianism, at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively Encyclopedia of Religion, \"Arianism\". and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the First Council of Ephesus in 431.Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm \"Council of Ephesus\"].\n\nThe Chalcedonian Definition, or Creed of Chalcedon, developed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451,Christian History Institute, [https://archive.is/20080106201425/http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2003/10/daily-10-08-2003.shtml First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon]. though rejected by the Oriental Orthodox churches, taught Christ \"to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably\": one divine and one human, and that both natures, while perfect in themselves, are nevertheless also perfectly united into one person.Pope Leo I, [http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/4ecumen2.htm Letter to Flavian]\n\nThe Athanasian Creed, received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: \"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance.\"Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]\".\n\nMost Christians (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Protestant alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.\n\nJesus\n\nThe central tenet of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah (Christ). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was anointed by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from the contemporary Jewish concept. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Metzger/Coogan, Oxford Companion to the Bible, pp. 513, 649.\n\nWhile there have been many theological disputes over the nature of Jesus over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and \"true God and true man\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not sin. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the New Testament, he rose from the dead,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  ascended to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the FatherWikisource:Nicene Creed and will ultimately return to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy, including the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and final establishment of the Kingdom of God.\n\nAccording to the canonical gospels of Matthew and Luke, Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although infancy gospels were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the gospels contained within the New Testament, because that part of his life is believed to be most important. The biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: his baptism, miracles, preaching, teaching and deeds.\n\nDeath and resurrection\n\nChristians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see 1 Corinthians 15) and the most important event in history.Hanegraaff. Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity. Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based. According to the New Testament, Jesus was crucified, died a physical death, was buried within a tomb and rose from the dead three days later.  \n\nThe New Testament mentions several resurrection appearances of Jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples, including \"more than five hundred brethren at once\", before Jesus' Ascension to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during Holy Week which includes Good Friday and Easter Sunday.\n\nThe death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in Christian theology, partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal life., , , , , , and \n\nChristian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord. Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.Fuller, The Foundations of New Testament Christology, p. 11. Some liberal Christians do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,A Jesus Seminar conclusion: \"in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on visionary experiences of Peter, Paul, and Mary.\"Funk. The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?. seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing myth. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues.Lorenzen. Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today, p. 13. Paul the Apostle, an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, \"If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.\" Ball/Johnsson (ed.). The Essential Jesus.\n\nSalvation\n\nPaul the Apostle, like Jews and Roman pagans of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity and eternal life. For Paul, the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus: Gentiles who are \"Christ's\" are, like Israel, descendants of Abraham and \"heirs according to the promise\". Wright, N.T. What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity? (Oxford, 1997), p. 121. The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the \"mortal bodies\" of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the \"children of God\" and were therefore no longer \"in the flesh\". \n\nModern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' substitutionary death and resurrection. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org] Martin Luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by God's grace, sometimes defined as \"unmerited favor\", even apart from baptism.\n\nChristians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self-redemption, but that sanctifying grace is irresistible.Westminster Confession, [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 Chapter X] ;Spurgeon, [http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism] . In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Arminian Protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in Jesus.\n\nTrinity\n\nTrinity refers to the teaching that the one GodChristianity's status as monotheistic is affirmed in, among other sources, the Catholic Encyclopedia (article \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]\"); William F. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity; H. Richard Niebuhr; About.com, [http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/monotheisticreligions/ Monotheistic Religion resources]; Kirsch, God Against the Gods; Woodhead, An Introduction to Christianity; The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia [http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0833762.html Monotheism]; The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071212011435/http://www.bartleby.com/59/5/monotheism.html monotheism]; New Dictionary of Theology, [http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_NDCT_Paul.htm Paul], pp. 496–99; Meconi. \"Pagan Monotheism in Late Antiquity\". p. 111f. comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons; the Father, the Son (incarnate in Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit. Together, these three persons are sometimes called the Godhead,Kelly. Early Christian Doctrines. pp. 87–90.Alexander. New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. p. 514f.McGrath. Historical Theology. p. 61. although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.Metzger/Coogan. Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 782. In the words of the Athanasian Creed, an early statement of Christian belief, \"the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God\".Kelly. The Athanasian Creed. They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation. While some Christians also believe that God appeared as the Father in the Old Testament, it is agreed that he appeared as the Son in the New Testament, and will still continue to manifest as the Holy Spirit in the present. But still, God still existed as three persons in each of these times.Oxford, \"Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg1207 However, traditionally there is a belief that it was the Son who appeared in the Old Testament because, for example, when the Trinity is depicted in art, the Son typically has the distinctive appearance, a cruciform halo identifying Christ, and in depictions of the Garden of Eden this looks forward to an Incarnation yet to occur. In some Early Christian sarcophagi the Logos is distinguished with a beard, \"which allows him to appear ancient, even preexistent.\"Heidi J. Hornik and Mikeal Carl Parsons, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nBmWpMKaDBVUC&pg=PA34 Interpreting Christian Art: Reflections on Christian art], Mercer University Press, 2003, , pp. 32–35.\n\nThe Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325, Christianity advocatedExamples of ante-Nicene statements:\n\n the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.\nFowler. World Religions: An Introduction for Students. p. 58.\n\nAccording to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in Western Christian theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three \"persons\" are each eternal and omnipotent. Other Christian religions including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others do not share those views on the Trinity.\n\nThe Latin word trias, from which trinity is derived, is first seen in the works of Theophilus of Antioch. He wrote of \"the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)\".Theophilus of Antioch Apologia ad Autolycum II 15 The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in Tertullian.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 50.Tertullian De Pudicitia chapter 21 In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of Origen.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 53.\n\nTrinitarians\n\nTrinitarianism denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the Trinity. Almost all Christian denominations and churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words \"Trinity\" and \"Triune\" do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of Tritheism), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father (Arianism). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.Moltman, Jurgen. The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God. Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. \n\nNontrinitarianism\n\nNontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as adoptionism or modalism, existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about Christology.Harnack, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]. Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, among groups with Unitarian theology in the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century,Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p.135 \"Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity\" in the 18th-century Enlightenment and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century.\n\nScriptures\n\nChristianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the biblical canon, the Old Testament and the New Testament, as the inspired word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in  is theopneustos, which literally means \"God-breathed\".\n\nSome believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles inerrant. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the King James Version.(§105–108)Second Helvetic Confession, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God]Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html online text] Another closely related view is Biblical infallibility or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography or science.\n\nThe books of the Bible accepted by the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches vary somewhat, with Jews accepting only the Hebrew Bible as canonical; there is however substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of traditions, and of the councils that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the Tanakh, the canon of the Hebrew Bible. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the Deuterocanonical Books as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the Septuagint, but are regarded by Protestants to be apocryphal. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.Metzger/Coogan, Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 39. The New Testament, originally written in Koine Greek, contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.\n\nModern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible. While the Authorized King James Version is held to by many because of its striking English prose, in fact it was translated from the Erasmus Greek Bible which in turn \"was based on a single 12th Century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us\".Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). Misquoting Jesus: the story behind who changed the Bible and why. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco  pages 209, 183 Much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text. Another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries. The injunction that women \"be silent and submissive\" in 1 Timothy 2 is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of Paul, a similar phrase in 1 Corinthians 14, which is thought to be by Paul, appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copyist. Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair \"when they pray or prophesies\", contradict this verse.\n\nA final issue with the Bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the New Testament. Other Gospels have now been recovered, such as those found near Nag Hammadi in 1945, and while some of these texts are quite different from what Christians have been used to, it should be understood that some of this newly recovered Gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with, or even earlier than, the New Testament Gospels. The core of the Gospel of Thomas, in particular, may date from as early as AD 50 (although some major scholars contest this early dating), and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical Gospels, texts that are mentioned in Luke 1:1–2. The Gospel of Thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical Gospels—verse 113, for example (\"The Father's Kingdom is spread out upon the earth, but people do not see it\"), is reminiscent of Luke 17:20–21—and the Gospel of John, with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed Gnosticism, has recently been seen as a possible response to the Gospel of Thomas, a text that is commonly labelled proto-Gnostic. Scholarship, then, is currently exploring the relationship in the Early Church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other, by analyzing new-found texts, by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny, and by an examination of the passage of New Testament texts to canonical status.\n\nCatholic interpretation\n\nIn antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in Alexandria and Antioch. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by Origen, tended to read Scripture allegorically, while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called theoria) could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.Kelly. Early Christian Doctrines. pp. 69–78.\n\nCatholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture § 115–118]. \n\nThe literal sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The spiritual sense is further subdivided into:\n* The allegorical sense, which includes typology. An example would be the parting of the Red Sea being understood as a \"type\" (sign) of baptism.\n* The moral sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.\n* The anagogical sense, which applies to eschatology, eternity and the consummation of the world\n\nRegarding exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:\n* The injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the literalThomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm \"Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses\"] Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116] \n* That the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly heldSecond Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html Dei Verbum (V.19)] .\n* That scripture must be read within the \"living Tradition of the whole Church\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III \"The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture\" § 113].  and\n* That \"the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome\".Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III \"The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith\" § 85]. \n\nProtestant interpretation\n\nClarity of Scripture\n\nProtestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and revealed all truth necessary for salvation. This concept is known as sola scriptura. Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or \"perspicuous\"), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be \"enveloped in darkness\". He advocated \"one definite and simple understanding of Scripture\". John Calvin wrote, \"all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light\".John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vii.iv.iv.html  Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles 2 Peter 3:14–18] The Second Helvetic Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zürich (successor to Protestant reformer Zwingli) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.\n\nOriginal intended meaning of Scripture\n\nProtestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the historical-grammatical method.Sproul. Knowing Scripture, pp. 45–61; Bahnsen, [http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics (article 6)]. The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in Biblical hermeneutics to find the intended original meaning in the text. This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations. The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text. The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said: \"A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture.\" (1890 edition page 103, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nFy9VAAAAMAAJ&focussearchwithinvolume&q\n%22fundamental+principle%22 view1], [https://books.google.com/books?idFy9VAAAAMAAJ&focus\nsearchwithinvolume&q%22neglect+this+principle%22 view2]) Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Taken together, both define the term (Biblical) hermeneutics.\n\nSome Protestant interpreters make use of typology.e.g., in his [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhcw/matthew/1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.1). Matthew Henry interprets the twin sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and Jewish Christians. For a contemporary treatment, see Glenny, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion].\n\nEschatology\n\nThe end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the Tribulation, death and the afterlife, the Rapture, the Second Coming of Jesus, Resurrection of the Dead, Heaven and Hell, Millennialism, the Last Judgment, the end of the world and the New Heavens and New Earth.\n\nChristians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the end of time after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the Kingdom of God in fulfillment of scriptural prophecies.Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis] questions 69 through 99\n\nDeath and afterlife\n\nMost Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or eternal damnation. This includes the general judgement at the resurrection of the dead as well as the belief (held by Roman Catholics,Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]\".Ott, Grundriß der Dogmatik, p. 566. OrthodoxDavid Moser, [http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead].Ken Collins, [http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?]. and most Protestants) in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of purgatory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence. Those who have attained this goal are called saints (Latin sanctus, \"holy\").Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]\".\n\nSome Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to mortalism, the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to Annihilationism, the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.\"The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, \"the dead are conscious of nothing.\" What is God's Purpose for the Earth?\" Official Site of Jehovah's Witnesses. Watchtower, 15 July 2002.\n\nWorship\n\nJustin Martyr described 2nd-century Christian liturgy in his First Apology (c. 150) to Emperor Antoninus Pius, and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:\n\nAnd on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html First Apology] §LXVII\n\nThus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an annual cycle, using a book called a lectionary. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a sermon, or homily. There are a variety of congregational prayers, including thanksgiving, confession and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The Lord's Prayer, or Our Father, is regularly prayed.\n\nSome groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between \"High\" church services, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and \"Low\" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. Seventh-day Adventists meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. Charismatic or Pentecostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. Quakers sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.\n\nSome evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music, dancing and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a minister, preacher, or pastor. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only a cappella music, either on principle (for example, many Churches of Christ object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).\n\nNearly all forms of churchmanship celebrate the Eucharist (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples bread, saying, \"This is my body\", and gave them wine saying, \"This is my blood\".Ignazio Silone, Bread and Wine (1937). Some Christian denominations practice closed communion. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of mortal sin. Most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.\n\nWorship can be varied for special events like baptisms or weddings in the service or significant feast days. In the early church, Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called Sunday school or Sabbath school (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).\n\nSacraments\n\nIn Christian belief and practice, a sacrament is a rite, instituted by Christ, that confers grace, constituting a sacred mystery. The term is derived from the Latin word sacramentum, which was used to translate the Greek word for mystery. Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.Cross/Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. p. 1435f.\n\nThe most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are Baptism and the Eucharist (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: Confirmation (Chrismation in the Orthodox tradition), Holy orders (ordination), Penance (or Confession), Anointing of the Sick and Matrimony (see Christian views on marriage).\n\nTaken together, these are the Seven Sacraments as recognized by churches in the High Church tradition—notably Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Independent Catholic, Old Catholic, many Anglicans and some Lutherans. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology. Christian denominations, such as Baptists, which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ordinances rather than sacraments.\n\nIn addition to this, the Church of the East has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick. These include Holy Leaven (Melka) and the sign of the cross.Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon.\n\nFile:Skondals kyrka 2005.jpg|Baptism, specifically infant baptism, in the Lutheran tradition\nFile:Исповедь берн собор.jpg|A penitent confessing his sins in a Ukrainian Catholic church\nFile:Methodistcommunion3.jpg|A Methodist minister celebrating the Eucharist\nFile:Anglican confirmation in Helsinki.jpg|Confirmation being administered in an Anglican church\nFile:Cheirotonia_Presbyter_1.jpeg|Ordination of a priest in the Eastern Orthodox tradition\nFile:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|Crowning during Holy Matrimony in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church\nFile:2017-04-12--Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction, on Holy Wednesday.jpg|Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction served on Great and Holy Wednesday\n\nLiturgical calendar\n\nRoman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the liturgical year. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of paraments and vestments for clergy, scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.\n\nWestern Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective rites. Calendars set aside holy days, such as solemnities which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus, Mary or the saints, and periods of fasting, such as Lent and other pious events such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.Hickman. Handbook of the Christian Year.\n\nSymbols\n\nChristianity has not generally practiced aniconism, or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, even if the early Jewish Christians sects, as well as some modern denominations, preferred to some extent not to use figures in their symbols, by invoking the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry.\n\nThe cross, which is today one of the most widely recognized symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX). Tertullian, in his book De Corona, tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.\" (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html De Corona, chapter 3]) Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the crucifix did not appear in use until the 5th century.Dilasser. The Symbols of the Church.\n\nAmong the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish or Ichthys seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century.Catholic Encyclopedia, \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]\". Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter (Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ), meaning, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.\n\nOther major Christian symbols include the chi-rho monogram, the dove (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the vine (symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.\n\nBaptism\n\nBaptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the Church. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. Others view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods are: by immersion; if immersion is total, by submersion; by affusion (pouring); and by aspersion (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of infant baptism;\"Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission\" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213] ); \"Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God\" ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] \"Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ\" ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit – The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)] ;\"As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away\" (William H. Brackney, [http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm Doing Baptism Baptist Style Believer's Baptism] ) the Orthodox Churches all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\"After the proclamation of faith, the baptismal water is prayed over and blessed as the sign of the goodness of God's creation. The person to be baptized is also prayed over and blessed with sanctified oil as the sign that his creation by God is holy and good. And then, after the solemn proclamation of \"Alleluia\" (God be praised), the person is immersed three times in the water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit\" ([http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID2&ID\n51 Orthodox Church in America: Baptism).]\"In the Orthodox Church we totally immerse, because such total immersion symbolizes death. What death? The death of the \"old, sinful man\". After Baptism we are freed from the dominion of sin, even though after Baptism we retain an inclination and tendency toward evil.\", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, article \"[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism Baptism] \". The Catholic Church also practices infant baptism,Catechism of the Catholic Church [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm#403 403], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm 1231, 1233, 1250, 1252]. usually by affusion, and utilizing the Trinitarian formula.Catechism of the Catholic Church [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#1240 1240].\n\nPrayer\n\nJesus' teaching on prayer in the Sermon on the Mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged. Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized. This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as genuflection or making the sign of the cross. Kneeling, bowing and prostrations (see also poklon) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony. At other times the older orans posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.\n\nIntercessory prayer is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the Apostle Peter on behalf of sick persons and by prophets of the Old Testament in favor of other people. In the Epistle of James, no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah. The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.\n\nThe ancient church, in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of (deceased) saints, and this remains the practice of most Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation, however, rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ. The reformer Huldrych Zwingli admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous.Madeleine Gray, The Protestant Reformation, (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church: \"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.\" The Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Church and Christological Councils\n\nChristianity began as a Jewish sect in the Levant of the middle east in the mid-1st century. Other than Second Temple Judaism, the primary religious influences of early Christianity are Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism.The term \"Christian\" (Greek ) was first used in reference to Jesus's disciples in the city of Antioch about 44 AD, meaning \"followers of Christ\". The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were \"brethren\", \"the faithful\", \"elect\", \"saints\", and \"believers\". The earliest recorded use of the term \"Christianity\" (Greek ) was by Ignatius of Antioch, around 100 AD. John Bowker states that Christian ideas such as \"angels, the end of the world, a final judgment, the resurrection and heaven and hell received form and substance from ... Zoroastrian beliefs\". Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the remaining Twelve Apostles, particularly Saint Peter, and Paul the Apostle, followed by the early bishops, whom Christians consider the successors of the Apostles.\n\nAccording to the Christian scriptures, Christians were from the beginning subject to persecution by some Jewish and Roman religious authorities, who disagreed with the apostles' teachings (See Split of early Christianity and Judaism). This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as Stephen and James, son of Zebedee. Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire, first in the year 64, when Emperor Nero blamed them for the Great Fire of Rome. According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that early Church leaders Peter and Paul of Tarsus were each martyred in Rome.\n\nFurther widespread persecutions of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under Decius and Diocletian. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the Church Fathers, and study of them is called Patristics. Notable early Fathers include Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Origen. However, Armenia is considered the first nation to accept Christianity in AD 301.\n\nKing Trdat IV made Christianity the state religion in Armenia between 301 and 314, it was not an entirely new religion in Armenia. It penetrated into the country from at least the third century, but may have been present even earlier.\n\nEnd of Roman persecution under Emperor Constantine (AD 313)\n\n \nState persecution ceased in the 4th century, when Constantine I issued an edict of toleration in 313. On 27 February 380, Emperor Theodosius I enacted a law establishing Nicene Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2], in: Bettenson. Documents of the Christian Church. p. 31. From at least the 4th century, Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization.Orlandis, A Short History of the Catholic Church (1993), preface.\n\nConstantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which sought to address the Arian heresy and formulated the Nicene Creed, which is still used by the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglican Communion and many Protestant churches. Nicaea was the first of a series of Ecumenical (worldwide) Councils which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning Christology.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 37f. The Assyrian Church of the East did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils, and are still separate today.\n\nThe presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st century in Egypt, and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around Carthage. Mark the Evangelist started the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in about AD 43.Eusebius of Caesarea, the author of Ecclesiastical History in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 AD. \"Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity\" Otto F.A. Meinardus p28. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity includes Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, Cyprian, Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo. The later rise of Islam in North Africa reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving only the Coptic Church in Egypt, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in the Horn of Africa and the Nubian Church in the Sudan (Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia).\n\nIn terms of prosperity and cultural life, the Byzantine Empire was one of the peaks in Christian history and Christian civilization,. and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth and culture.. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance..\n\nEarly Middle Ages\n\nWith the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the papacy became a political player, first visible in Pope Leo's diplomatic dealings with Huns and Vandals. The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. While Arianists instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see Massacre of Verden as example), Catholicism also spread among the Germanic peoples,Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 238–42. the Celtic and Slavic peoples, the Hungarians and the Baltic peoples. Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of Western civilization, at least since the 4th century.\n\nAround 500, St. Benedict set out his Monastic Rule, establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of monasteries. Monasticism became a powerful force throughout Europe, and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in Ireland, Scotland and Gaul, contributing to the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century.\n\nIn the 7th century Muslims conquered Syria (including Jerusalem), North Africa and Spain. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine empire in its decades long conflict with Persia.Mullin, 2008, p. 88. Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of Carolingian leaders, the papacy began to find greater political support in the Frankish Kingdom.Mullin, 2008, p. 93–4.\n\nThe Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. Pope Gregory the Great dramatically reformed ecclesiastical structure and administration.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 244–47. In the early 8th century, iconoclasm became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the Byzantine emperors. The Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, p. 260. In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of Cluny.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 278–81.\n\nHebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the Christian era.\n\nHigh and Late Middle Ages\n\nIn the west, from the 11th century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see University of Oxford, University of Paris and University of Bologna.) The traditional medieval universities—evolved from Catholic and Protestant church schools—then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as professionals. Prof. Walter Rüegg, editor of A History of the University in Europe, reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics, lawyers, civil servants and physicians.Rudy, The Universities of Europe, 1100–1914, p. 40\n\nOriginally teaching only theology, universities steadily added subjects including medicine, philosophy and law, becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 305, 312, 314f..\nThe university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting.Rüegg, Walter: \"Foreword. The University as a European Institution\", in: A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , pp. XIX–XX Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (Scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century AD.Riché, Pierre (1978): \"Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century\", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, , pp. 126–7, 282–98\n\nAccompanying the rise of the \"new towns\" throughout Europe, mendicant orders were founded, bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the FranciscansGonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86. and the DominicansGonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 305, 310f., 316f. founded by St. Francis and St. Dominic respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the Cistercians, whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and the building of the great European cathedrals.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 321–23, 365f.\n\nFrom 1095 under the pontificate of Urban II, the Crusades were launched.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 292–300. These were a series of military campaigns in the Holy Land and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I for aid against Turkish expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade.Riley-Smith. The Oxford History of the Crusades.\n\nOver a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a schism dividing it into a so-called Latin or Western Christian branch, the Roman Catholic Church,The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language and an Eastern, largely Greek, branch, the Orthodox Church. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical and doctrinal issues, most notably papal primacy of jurisdiction.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 91 The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence  (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various smaller eastern churches.\n\nBeginning around 1184, following the crusade against the Cathar heresy,Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 300, 304–05. various institutions, broadly referred to as the Inquisition, were established with the aim of suppressing heresy and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through conversion and prosecution.Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.\n\nProtestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation\n\n15th-century Renaissance brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the Reformation, resulted in the splintering of the Western Christendom into several branches.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. p. 7. Martin Luther in 1517 protested against the sale of indulgences and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic doctrine.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. pp. 39, 55–61.\n\nOther reformers like Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Calvin, Knox and Arminius further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called Protestantism, which repudiated the primacy of the pope, the role of tradition, the seven sacraments and other doctrines and practices. The Reformation in England began in 1534, when King Henry VIII had himself declared head of the Church of England. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were dissolved.Schama. A History of Britain. pp. 306–10.\n\nThomas Müntzer, Andreas Karlstadt and other theologians perceived both the Roman Catholic Church and the confessions of the Magisterial Reformation as corrupted. Their activity brought about the Radical Reformation, which gave birth to various Anabaptist denominations.\n\nPartly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reform.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church, pp. 242–44. The Council of Trent clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.Simon. Great Ages of Man: The Reformation. pp. 109–120.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThroughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of religious violence and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. Lutheranism spread into northern, central and eastern parts of present-day Germany, Livonia and Scandinavia. Anglicanism was established in England in 1534. Calvinism and its varieties (such as Presbyterianism) were introduced in Scotland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland and France. Arminianism gained followers in the Netherlands and Frisia. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of conflicts in which religion played a key factor. The Thirty Years' War, the English Civil War and the French Wars of Religion are prominent examples. These events intensified the Christian debate on persecution and toleration.A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689.\n\nPost-Enlightenment\n\nIn the era known as the Great Divergence, when in the West the Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific revolution brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political ideologies such as versions of socialism and liberalism. Events ranged from mere anti-clericalism to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the Dechristianisation during the French Revolution,Mortimer Chambers, The Western Experience (vol. 2) chapter 21. the Spanish Civil War and certain Marxist movements, especially the Russian Revolution and the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union under state atheism.Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011.Inside Central Asia: A Political and Cultural History, by Dilip Hiro. Penguin, 2009.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.494\"\n\nEspecially pressing in Europe was the formation of nation states after the Napoleonic era. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the University of Fribourg, looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic countries such as Belgium, Spain and to some extent Austria, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland, Ireland and Switzerland, all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in Germany, the Netherlands and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy, countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultramontanism, especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in England (to a much lesser extent), often forced Catholic churches, organizations and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the First Vatican Council, and in Germany would lead directly to the Kulturkampf, where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of Bismarck managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.\n\nChristian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic and Estonia, while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general, with the western civilization no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity.\n\nSome Europeans (including diaspora), Indigenous peoples of the Americas and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples' historical folk religions. Approximately 7.1 to 10% of Arabs are Christians, most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nDemographics\n\nWith around 2.4 billion adherents, split into three main branches of Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox, Christianity is the world's largest religion. The Christian share of the world's population has stood at around 33% for the last hundred years, which says that one in three persons on earth are Christians. This masks a major shift in the demographics of Christianity; large increases in the developing world have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world, mainly in Europe and North America.Werner Ustorf. \"A missiological postscript\", in McLeod and Ustorf (eds), The Decline of Christendom in (Western) Europe, 1750–2000, (Cambridge University Press, 2003) pp. 219–20. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, within the next four decades, Christians will remain the world's largest religion; and by 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.\n\nAs a percentage of Christians, the Catholic Church and Orthodoxy (both Eastern and Oriental) are declining, while Protestants and other Christians are on the rise.Johnstone, Patrick, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nAVzFAgAAQBAJ&pgPA109&dq\nchristianity+2050+protestant&hlpl&sa\nX&eiwQO7VJbSI8i1OraXgdAC&ved\n0CB8Q6AEwAA#vonepage&q\nchristianity%202050%20protestant&ffalse \"The Future of the Global Church: History, Trends and Possibilities\"], p. 100, fig 4.10 & 4.11Hillerbrand, Hans J., [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4tbFBQAAQBAJ&lpgPT3311&pg\nPT3311#vonepage&q&f\nfalse \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set\"], p. 1815, \"Observers carefully comparing all these figures in the total context will have observed the even more startling finding that for the first itime ever in the history of Protestantism, Wider Protestants will by 2050 have become almost exactly as numerous as Roman Catholics – each with just over 1.5 billion followers, or 17 percent of the world, with Protestants growing considerably faster than Catholics each year.\" The so-called popular ProtestantismA flexible term; defined as all forms of Protestantism with the notable exception of the historical denominations deriving directly from the Protestant Reformation. is one of the fastest growing religious categories in the world.\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion in Europe, the Americas and Southern Africa. In Asia, it is the dominant religion in Georgia, Armenia, East Timor and the Philippines.[http://www.britannica.com/eb/table?tocId=9394911 Encyclopædia Britannica] table of religions, by region. Retrieved November 2007.  However, it is declining in many areas including the Northern and Western United States, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), northern Europe (including Great Britain, Scandinavia and other places), France, Germany, the Canadian provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, and parts of Asia (especially the Middle East – due to the Christian emigration,Barrett/Kurian.World Christian Encyclopedia, p. 139 (Britain), 281 (France), 299 (Germany). South Korea, Taiwan, and Macau).\n\nThe Christian population is not decreasing in Brazil, the Southern United States and the province of Alberta, Canada, but the percentage is decreasing. In countries such as Australia and New Zealand,[http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx Table 28, 2006 Census Data – QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Tables].  the Christian population are declining in both numbers and percentage.\n\nDespite the declining numbers, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western World, where 70% are Christians. A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that 76.2% of Europeans, 73.3% in Oceania and about 86.0% in the Americas (90.0% in Latin America and 77.4% in North America) identified themselves as Christians. By 2010 about 157 countries and territories in the world had Christian majorities.\n\nHowever, there are many charismatic movements that have become well established over large parts of the world, especially Africa, Latin America and Asia.David Stoll, \"Is Latin America Turning Protestant?\" published Berkeley: University of California Press. 1990 Since 1900, primarily due to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported Evangelical Protestants grew three times the world's population rate, and twice that of Islam.  St. Mary's University study estimated about 10.2 million Muslim convert to Christianity in 2015. as well a significant numbers of Muslims converts to Christianity in Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan Algeria,[http://www.christianaction.org.za/articles./MuslimsTurnToChrist.htm Muslims Turn to Christ – ChristianAction] Belgium, France, Germany, Iran, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Russia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, United States, and Central Asia. It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in India (mostly Hindus), and Malaysia, Mongolia, Nigeria,[http://pewforum.org/world-affairs/countries/?countryID\n150 Religious Demographic Profiles – Pew Forum]  Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nIn most countries in the developed world, church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.Putnam, Democracies in Flux: The Evolution of Social Capital in Contemporary Society, p. 408. Some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions,McGrath, Christianity: An Introduction, p. xvi. while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general.Peter Marber, Money Changes Everything: How Global Prosperity Is Reshaping Our Needs, Values and Lifestyles, p. 99. Europe's Christian population, though in decline, still constitutes the largest geographical component of the religion.Philip Jenkins God's Continent, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007,  p. 56 According to data from the 2012 European Social Survey, around a third of European Christians say they attend services once a month or more, Conversely about more than two-thirds of Latin American Christians and according to the World Values Survey about 90% of African Christians (in Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Zimbabwe) said they attended church regularly.\n\nChristianity, in one form or another, is the sole state religion of the following nations: Argentina (Roman Catholic), Tuvalu (Reformed), Tonga (Methodist), Norway (Lutheran),[http://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/080410/losere-band-men-fortsatt-statskirke Løsere bånd, men fortsatt statskirke] , ABC Nyheter[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8076910 Staten skal ikke lenger ansette biskoper], NRK Costa Rica (Roman Catholic), Kingdom of Denmark (Lutheran), England (Anglican), Georgia (Georgian Orthodox), Greece (Greek Orthodox), Iceland (Lutheran), Liechtenstein (Roman Catholic), Malta (Roman Catholic), Monaco (Roman Catholic), and Vatican City (Roman Catholic).\n\nThere are numerous other countries, such as Cyprus, which although do not have an established church, still give official recognition and support to a specific Christian denomination.\n\nFile:Christian world map.png|Countries with 50% or more Christians are colored purple while countries with 10% to 50% Christians are colored pink\nFile:Map of state religions.svg|Nations with Christianity as their state religion are in blue\nFile:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|Nations with Christianity as their state religion (detailed map; see legend for more)\nFile:Catholic population.svg|Distribution of Roman Catholics\nFile:Countries by percentage of Protestants (2010).svg|Distribution of Protestants\nFile:Eastern Orthodoxy by country.png|Distribution of Eastern Orthodox\nFile:Oriental Orthodoxy by country.png|Distribution of Oriental Orthodox\nFile:Other Christians by country.png|Other Christians by number: black - more than 10 million; red - more than 1 million\n\nMajor denominations\n\nThe three primary divisions of Christianity are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism. However, there are other present and historical Christian groups that do not fit neatly into one of these primary categories. The Nicene Creed is accepted as authoritative by most Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and major Protestant churches.\n\nThere is a diversity of doctrines and practices among groups calling themselves Christian. These groups are sometimes classified under denominations, though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system.Sydney E. Ahlstrom, characterized denominationalism in America as \"a virtual ecclesiology\" that \"first of all repudiates the insistences of the Roman Catholic church, the churches of the 'magisterial' Reformation, and of most sects that they alone are the true Church.\" ();\n*;\n*Wendell Winkler, [http://www.thebible.net/introchurch/ch4.html Christ's Church is not a Denomination];\n* A broader distinction that is sometimes drawn is between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, which has its origins in the East–West Schism (Great Schism) of the 11th century.\n\nIn addition to the Lutheran and Reformed (or Calvinist) branches of the Reformation, there is Anglicanism after the English Reformation. The Anabaptist tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history. Adventist, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal and other Protestant confessions arose in the following centuries.\n\nCatholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Church consists of those particular Churches, headed by bishops, in communion with the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, as its highest authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance.Second Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium] .Duffy, Saints and Sinners, p. 1. Like Eastern Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, through apostolic succession, traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ.Hitchcock, Geography of Religion, p. 281.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History, p. 11, 14. Catholics maintain that the \"one, holy, catholic and apostolic church\" founded by Jesus subsists fully in the Roman Catholic Church, but also acknowledges other Christian churches and communitiesSecond Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium] , chapter 2, paragraph 15.Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p3.htm#IV paragraph 865].  and works towards reconciliation among all Christians. The Catholic faith is detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.Marthaler, Introducing the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Traditional Themes and Contemporary Issues (1994), preface.\n\nThe 2,834 seesAnnuario Pontificio (2012), p. 1142. are grouped into 24 particular autonomous Churches (the largest of which being the Latin Church), each with its own distinct traditions regarding the liturgy and the administering the sacraments.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 71 With more than 1.1 billion baptized members, the Catholic Church is the largest Christian church and represents over half of all Christians as well as one sixth of the world's population.Central Intelligence Agency, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA World Factbook] (2007).Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html Religions by Adherents]Zenit.org, \"[http://www.zenit.org/article-18894?l\nenglish Number of Catholics and Priests Rises] \", 12 February 2007.\n\nEastern Orthodox Church\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church consists of those churches in communion with the Patriarchal Sees of the East, such as the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.Cross/Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, p. 1199. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through apostolic succession and has an episcopal structure, though the autonomy of its component parts is emphasized, and most of them are national churches. A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the Great Schism. Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity, with an estimated 225–300 million adherents.\n\nOriental Orthodoxy\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches (also called \"Old Oriental\" churches) are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—Nicaea, Constantinople and Ephesus—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon and instead espouse a Miaphysite christology. The Oriental Orthodox communion consists of six groups: Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (India) and Armenian Apostolic churches. These six churches, while being in communion with each other are completely independent hierarchically. These churches are generally not in communion with Eastern Orthodox Churches with whom they are in dialogue for erecting a communion.\n\nAssyrian Church of the East\n\nThe Assyrian Church of the East, with an unbroken patriarchate established in the 17th century, is an independent Eastern Christian denomination which claims continuity from the Church of the East - in parallel to the Catholic patriarchate established in the 16th century that evolved into the Chaldean Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope.\n\nProtestantism\n\nIn the 16th century, Martin Luther, and subsequently Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, inaugurated what has come to be called Protestantism. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as Lutherans. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the Reformed tradition.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. pp. 251–59. The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the Protestant Reformation, often followed by further divisions.\n\nIn the 18th century, for example, Methodism grew out of Anglican minister John Wesley's evangelical and revival movement. Several Pentecostal and non-denominational churches, which emphasize the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit, in turn grew out of Methodism. Because Methodists, Pentecostals and other evangelicals stress \"accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior\", which comes from Wesley's emphasis of the New Birth, they often refer to themselves as being born-again.\n\nEstimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Roman Catholicism in number of followers (although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination). Often that number is put at more than 800 million, corresponding to nearly 40% of world's Christians. The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e. Adventists, Anglicans, Baptists, Reformed (Calvinists),This branch was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed. It includes Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Lutherans, Methodists and Pentecostals. Nondenominational, evangelical, charismatic, neo-charismatic, independent and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/evangelical-churches World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches]: \"Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition \"per se\" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between \"evangelical\" and \"mainline\" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities.\"\n\nA special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the Church of England and organized in the Anglican Communion. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.Sykes/Booty/Knight. The Study of Anglicanism, p. 219. Some Anglicans consider their church a branch of the \"One Holy Catholic Church\" alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox.Gregory Hallam, [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism].Gregory Mathewes-Green, \"[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]\", Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim Vol. 2, No. 4. \n\nWhile Anglicans, Lutherans and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated in the Magisterial Reformation, other Protestant groups such as the Anabaptists originated in the Radical Reformation and are distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism; they believe in baptism only of adult believers — credobaptism. (Anabaptists are made up mostly of Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites and Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptist groups.) \n\nSome groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as \"Christians\" or \"born-again Christians\". They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communitiesConfessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to \"the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.\" (MacCulloch, The Reformation: A History, p. xxiv.) by calling themselves \"non-denominational\" or \"evangelical\". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.\n\nRestorationism\n\nThe Second Great Awakening, a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 91f. A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the Great Apostasy. In Asia, Iglesia ni Cristo is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.\n\nSome of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the Jehovah's Witnesses movement and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, the Seventh-day Adventists. Others, including the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Evangelical Christian Church in Canada,Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (2004)Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009) Churches of Christ, and the Christian churches and churches of Christ, have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the Christadelphians and Latter Day Saint movement. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.\n\nOther\n\nVarious smaller Independent Catholic communities, such as the Old Catholic Church, include the word Catholic in their title, and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the Catholic Church, but are no longer in full communion with the Holy See.\n\nEsoteric Christians regard Christianity as a mystery religion,Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion: Selected Papers Presented at the 17th Congress and profess the existence and possession of certain esoteric doctrines or practices,From the Greek ἐσωτερικός (esôterikos, \"inner\"). The term esotericism itself was coined in the 17th century. (Oxford English Dictionary Compact Edition, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 894.)Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Antoine Faivre, Roelof van den Broek, Jean-Pierre Brach, Dictionary of Gnosis & Western Esotericism, Brill 2005. hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of \"enlightened\", \"initiated\", or highly educated people. Some of the esoteric Christian institutions include the Rosicrucian Fellowship, the Anthroposophical Society and Martinism.\n\nMessianic Judaism (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. The movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s, and it blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of \"Yeshua\" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.\n\nChristian culture\n\nWestern culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and a large portion of the population of the Western hemisphere can be described as cultural Christians. The notion of \"Europe\" and the \"Western World\" has been intimately connected with the concept of \"Christianity and Christendom\" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.\n\nThough Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the Greek and Roman empires, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Europe. Until the Age of Enlightenment, Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science. Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into Christian philosophy, Christian art, Christian music, Christian literature etc.\n\nChristianity has had a significant impact on education as the church created the bases of the Western system of education,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67592/Forms-of-Christian-education Encyclopædia Britannica] Forms of Christian education and was the sponsor of founding universities in the Western world; as the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting. Historically, Christianity has often been a patron of science and medicine. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many Catholic clergy;Susan Elizabeth Hough, Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man, Princeton University Press, 2007, , [https://books.google.com/books?id\nrvmDeAxEiO8C&pgPA68 p. 68.] Jesuits in particular,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/302999/Jesuit Encyclopædia Britannica] Jesuit have been active in the sciences throughout history and have made significant contributions to the development of science.Wallace, William A. (1984). Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science. N.J.: Princeton University Press. Protestantism also has had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.Sztompka, 2003 The Civilizing influence of Christianity includes social welfare,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67594/Church-and-social-welfare Encyclopædia Britannica] Church and social welfare founding hospitals,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67597/Care-for-the-sick Encyclopædia Britannica] Care for the sick economics (as the Protestant work ethic),[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67599/Property-poverty-and-the-poor Encyclopædia Britannica] Property, poverty, and the poor, politics,[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67577/Church-and-state Encyclopædia Britannica] Church and state architecture,Sir Banister Fletcher, History of Architecture on the Comparative Method. literature,Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries\", The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp. 409–445 (416, table 1) personal hygiene,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nvcdEs3EAAkUC&printsecfrontcover&dq\nChristianity+in+Action:+The+History+of+the+International&hlit&sa\nX&ved0ahUKEwiN5eGe-KDKAhWFXhQKHe_aBdkQ6AEIHTAA#v\nonepage&qChristianity%20in%20Action%3A%20The%20History%20of%20the%20International&f\nfalse Christianity in Action: The History of the International Salvation Army] p.16 and family life.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67603/The-tendency-to-spiritualize-and-individualize-marriage Encyclopædia Britannica] The tendency to spiritualize and individualize marriage\n\nEastern Christians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the reign of the Ummayad and the Abbasid by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic.Hill, Donald.

According to 100 Years of Nobel Prizes a review of Nobel prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that (65.4%) of Nobel Prizes Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference.Baruch A. Shalev, 100 Years of Nobel Prizes (2003), Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, p.57: between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 654 Laureates belong to 28 different religions. Most (65.4%) have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. \n\nPostchristianityG.C. Oosthuizen. Postchristianity in Africa. C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd (31 December 1968).  is the term for the decline of Christianity, particularly in Europe, Canada, Australia and to a minor degree the Southern Cone, in the 20th and 21st centuries, considered in terms of postmodernism. It refers to the loss of Christianity's monopoly on values and world view in historically Christian societies.\n\nCultural Christians are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the popular culture, art, music and so on related to it. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.\n\nEcumenism\n\nChristian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th century, Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, pp. 581–84. One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the World Evangelical Alliance founded in 1846 in London or the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the World Council of Churches founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the National Council of Churches in Australia which includes Roman Catholics.\n\nThe other way was institutional union with United and uniting churches, a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany. Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada,McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 413f. and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia. The Church of South India was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 498.\n\nThe ecumenical, monastic Taizé Community is notable for being composed of more than one hundred brothers from Protestant and Catholic traditions. The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, France, is named the \"Church of Reconciliation\". The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young pilgrims annually.Oxford, \"Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg. 307.\n \nSteps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their Great Schism in 1054;McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 373. the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 583. and some Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches signing the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation. In 2006, the World Methodist Council, representing all Methodist denominations, adopted the declaration.\n\nCriticism and apologetics \n\nCriticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the Apostolic Age, with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes (e.g.  and ).International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982  page 175 In the 2nd century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135 by James D. G. Dunn 1999  pages 112–113 Additionally a sacrifice to remove sins in advance, for everyone or as a human being, did not fit to the Jewish sacrifice ritual, furthermore God is said to judge people on their deeds instead of their beliefs.Asher Norman Twenty-six Reasons why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus Feldheim Publishers 2007  page 11Keith Akers The Lost Religion of Jesus: Simple Living and Nonviolence in Early Christianity Lantern Books 2000  page 103 One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher Celsus, who wrote The True Word, a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society. In response, the church father Origen published his treatise Contra Celsum, or Against Celsus, a seminal work of Christian apologetics, which systematically addressed Celsus's criticisms and brought Christianity a level of academic respectability.\n\nBy the 3rd century, criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it. Wild rumors about Christians were widely circulated, claiming that they were atheists and that, as part of their rituals, they devoured human infants and engaged in incestuous orgies. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry wrote the fifteen-volume Adversus Christianos as a comprehensive attack on Christianity, in part building on the teachings of Plotinus.The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 1 by George Thomas Kurian and James Smith 2010  page 527Apologetic Discourse and the Scribal Tradition by Wayne Campbell Kannaday 2005  pages 32–33\n\nBy the 12th century, the Mishneh Torah (i.e., Rabbi Moses Maimonides) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus who had a physical body.A Dictionary Of Jewish-Christian Relations by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005  page 168 In the 19th century, Nietzsche began to write a series of polemics on the \"unnatural\" teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996  pages 90–93 In the 20th century, the philosopher Bertrand Russell expressed his criticism of Christianity in Why I Am Not a Christian, formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999  pages 77–87\n\nCriticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. Jewish and Muslim theologians criticize the doctrine of the Trinity held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three Gods, running against the basic tenet of monotheism.Christianity: An Introduction by Alister E. McGrath 2006  pp. 125–126. New Testament scholar Robert M. Price has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in \"The Christ Myth Theory and its problems\".\" The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems \", published 2011 by American Atheist press, Cranford, New Jersey, \n\nChristian apologetics aims to present a rational basis for Christianity. The word \"apologetic\" comes from the Greek word \"apologeomai\", meaning \"in defense of\". Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher Thomas Aquinas presented five arguments for God's existence in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles was a major apologetic work. Another famous apologist, G. K. Chesterton, wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.(http://www.chesterton.org/why-i-believe-in-christianity/) He pointed to the advance of Christian civilizations as proof of its practicality. The physicist and priest John Polkinghorne, in his Questions of Truth discusses the subject of religion and science, a topic that other Christian apologists such as Ravi Zacharias, John Lennox and William Lane Craig have engaged, with the latter two men opining that the inflationary Big Bang model is evidence for the existence of God.
