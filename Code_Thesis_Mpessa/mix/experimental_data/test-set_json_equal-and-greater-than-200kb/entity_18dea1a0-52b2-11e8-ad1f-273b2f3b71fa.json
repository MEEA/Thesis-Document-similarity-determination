  "textBody" : "Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.\"What do I mean by individualism?\nI mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.\"[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm Mini-Manual of Individualism by Han Ryner] \"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. \"Anarchism and the State\" in Individual Liberty Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. Benjamin R. Tucker, a famous 19th-century individualist anarchist, held that \"if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny.\"\n\nOverview\n\nAmong the early influences on individualist anarchism were William Godwin, Josiah Warren (\"sovereignty of the individual\"), Max Stirner (egoism), Lysander Spooner (\"natural law\"), Pierre Joseph Proudhon (mutualism), Henry David Thoreau (transcendentalism),\"Paralelamente, al otro lado del atlántico, en el diferente contexto de una nación a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros filósofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

These are:\n\n1. The concentration on the individual and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.\"En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, \"más allá del bien y del mal\" como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)\"] \"Stirner himself, however, has no truck with \"higher beings.\" Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all \"higher beings,\" regarding them as a variety of what he calls \"spooks,\" or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God . . . it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism.

The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today.\"The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists' use of direct action to create revolutionary situations.\"[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca31 \"A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?\"]  in An Anarchist FAQ\"Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria.

The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\"propaganda by the deed\") and the anarchist burglars (\"individual reappropriation\") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary , invitations to revolt.\"[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm THE \"ILLEGALISTS\" by Doug Imrie] \n\n3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists.Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone \"uniones de egoístas\", formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] \"The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would \"care best for their welfare if they unite with others.\" [p. 309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls \"intercourse,\" or \"union\" between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p. 218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n\n\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character ... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist? ... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one.\" [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23]\"[https://www.webcitation.org/query?urlhttp://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG6.html&date\n2009-10-25+06:43:10 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?] Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized.\n\nThe egoist form of individualist anarchism, derived from the philosophy of Max Stirner, supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases  –  taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but \"the individuals are its reality\"  –  he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.\"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as I entitle, that is, empower myself to take…\" From The Ego and Its Own, quoted in  Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw \"associations of egoists\" drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, American individualist anarchism \"stresses the isolation of the individual  –  his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is \"aesthetic\" anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War.\"[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism by Eunice Minette Schuster]  It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account \"the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society ... the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs.\" and so \"Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal socialism ... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism.\"[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 \"G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?\"] in An Anarchist FAQ Contemporary individualist anarchist Kevin Carson characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that \"Unlike the rest of the socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business.\" Kevin Carson. Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1\n\nIn European individualist anarchism a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such \"The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run.\"[https://archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry.

Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15 and Italian anti-organizational insurrectionarism.\"Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian social anarchist Errico Malatesta became involved \"in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant.\" Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th \"it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy.\".[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 Murray Bookchin]. Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]\n\nAnother important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted \"amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general.\"\nAs such Murray Bookchin describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who \"expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing.\".[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 \"2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction\" in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism – An Unbridgeable Chasm] In this way free love currents and other radical lifestyles such as naturism had popularity among individualist anarchists.\n\nFor Catalan historian Xavier Diez, individualist anarchism \"under its iconoclastic, antiintelectual, antitheist run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of nation, it opposed its internationalism. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the military institution, it opposed its antimilitarism. Against the concept of industrial civilization, it opposed its naturist vision\".\n\nIn regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to mutualism (Proudhon, Émile Armand, early Benjamin Tucker), egoistic disrespect for \"ghosts\" such as private property and markets (Stirner, John Henry Mackay, Lev Chernyi, later Tucker), and adherents to anarcho-communism (Albert Libertad, illegalism, Renzo Novatore).\"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy.

Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962\n\nOn the issue of violence opinions have gone from a violentist point of view mainly exemplified by illegalism and insurrectionary anarchism to one that can be called anarcho-pacifist.

Broadview Press. p. 20 and philosophical anarchist who was influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,\"Anarchism\", Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006 (UK version) and developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.\"Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html \"Anarchism\"], Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society. \"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…\" – footnote, Ch. 2 Political Justice by William Godwin. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.\"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Godwin, William]\". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us \"of more worth and importance' than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good. Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to \"private judgement\" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.\n\nGodwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that \"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.\" The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority, though he believed it to be preferable to dictatorship.\n\nGodwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as \"the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry.\" However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. This was to be based on utilitarian principles; he said: \"Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated.\" However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual \"private judgement.\" He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarchist communism.\n\nGodwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the Socialist Standard, organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;\"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism\" by ALB, The Socialist Standard Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the \"founder of communist anarchism\";Rothbard, Murray. \"[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html Edmund Burke, Anarchist].\" and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of \"private judgement\" and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice. Many of Godwin's views changed over time, as noted by Kropotkin.\n\nWilliam Godwin's influenced \"the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism).\"[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini. \"Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy\"]\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an \"anarchist.\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml \"Anarchism\"], BBC Radio 4 program, In Our Time, Thursday December 7, 2006.

Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist, while others regard him to be a social anarchist.Bowen, James & Purkis, Jon. 2004.

History of Economics Review, No.31 Winter 2000. Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20 Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana,Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his \"Bank of the People\"] (1848). and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker.Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online\np. 1\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property.\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarchist-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.\" An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation ...\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006).  p. 217 and famously declared that \"property is theft!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists, who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon, and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin, while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\nMutualism\n\nMutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market.[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction] Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\".Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 & 22.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Meek & Oppenheimer). Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 19.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb & Oppenheimer). Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: \"... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all.\"Solution of the Social Problem, 1848–49.\n\nInsofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor.  However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession.\")Swartz, Clarence Lee.

However, \"some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term \"socialist.\" But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right.\"[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4.

Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that \"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few ... by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost.\"\n\nMax Stirner\n\nJohann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the nom de plume he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German 'Stirn'), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, which translates literally as The Only One [individual] and his Property). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig, and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.\n\nEgoism \n\nMax Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called \"egoism,\" is a form of individualist anarchism. Max Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose \"name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism.\" In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige and sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and His Property)Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177 was published, which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.\" Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests.Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190 He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to \"a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling,\" saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather \"lives themselves out\" without regard to \"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby.\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual's power to obtain what he desires.The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions – including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society – were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to \"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members.\"Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96 Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Unions of Egoists, non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the state. A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. Even murder is permissible \"if it is right for me,\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191 though it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.\n\nFor Stirner, property simply comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.\" And, \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.\" He says, \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\".Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248 His concept of \"egoistic property\" not only a lack of moral restraint on how one obtains and uses things, but includes other people as well.Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194 His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin's altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.\n\nThis position on property is much different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through laborWeir, David. Anarchy & Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146 and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, \"with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself.\"McElroy, Wendy.

Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora Marsden and John Beverly Robinson.\n\nIn Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.Levy, Carl. \"[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_1/Anarchism.html Anarchism]\". Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007.  2009-10-31. They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.Avrich, Paul. \"The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution\". Russian Review, Vol. 26, No. 4. (Oct., 1967). p. 343 This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman\n\nThough Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. \"For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management\" discusses Stirner and speaks of a \"communist egoism,\" which is said to be a \"synthesis of individualism and collectivism,\" and says that \"greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society.\"For Ourselves,  The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything, 1974. Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are influenced by Stirner.see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88. Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays.Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50.\n\nEarly American individualist anarchism \n\nJosiah Warren \n\n Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist,Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], Slate.com and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published,William Bailie,  Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist  –  A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20 an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates.\nWarren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase \"Cost the limit of price,\" with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.\"A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals…\". Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce.\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included \"Utopia\" and \"Modern Times.\" Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.Charles A. Madison. \"Anarchism in the United States\". Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1945), p. 53 Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them.\n\nHenry David Thoreau \n\n Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later naturist currents, simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. \"Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.\"\n\nThe essay Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican–American War. The essay later influenced Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy through its advocacy of nonviolent resistance.[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard] It is also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty. Some individualist anarchists, such as Thoreau,Johnson, Ellwood. The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature, Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138.Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, edited by Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12. do not speak of economics but simply the right of \"disunion\" from the state, and foresee the gradual elimination of the state through social evolution.\n\nDevelopments and expansion\n\nFree love, anarcha-feminism and LGBT issues\n\nAn important current within individualist anarchism is free love.[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy] Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women. The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois WaisbrookerJoanne E. Passet, \"Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,\" in: Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50. but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's The Word (1872–1890, 1892–1893). Also M. E. Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love. Later John William Lloyd, a collaborator of Benjamin Tucker´s periodical Liberty, published in 1931 a sex manual that he called The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love.[http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd \"The Karezza Method\"]\n\nIn Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Émile Armand.[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and \"la camaraderie amoureuse\". Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy] He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory. In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by individualist feminists Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, Rirette Maitrejean, and Sophia Zaïkovska.[http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque \"Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque »\"] \n\nThe Brazilian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura lectured on topics such as education, women's rights, free love, and antimilitarism. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay.http://www.nodo50.org/insurgentes/textos/mulher/09marialacerda.htm \"Maria Lacerda de Moura – Uma Anarquista Individualista Brasileira\" by She also wrote for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine Al Margen alongside Miguel Gimenez Igualada\"Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada, al escritor Gonzalo Vidal, u otros habituales de la prensa individualista como Costa Iscar, Mariano Gallardo o la periodista brasileña Maria Lacerda de Moura.\"\n\nIn Germany, the Stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.\n\nFreethought \n\nFreethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism.\n\nIn the United States, \"freethought was a basically anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\".Wendy McElroy [https://mises.org/library/culture-individualist-anarchism-late-19th-century-america \"The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America\"] \"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty ... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\".\n\nIn Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. \"Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church ... Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in Estudios (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.\" This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine Ética and Iniciales \"there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.\".\n\nAnarcho-naturism\n\nAnother important current, especially within French and Spanish\"Proliferarán así diversos grupos que practicarán el excursionismo, el naturismo, el nudismo, la emancipación sexual o el esperantismo, alrededor de asociaciones informales vinculadas de una manera o de otra al anarquismo. Precisamente las limitaciones a las asociaciones obreras impuestas desde la legislación especial de la Dictadura potenciarán indirectamente esta especie de asociacionismo informal en que confluirá el movimiento anarquista con esta heterogeneidad de prácticas y tendencias. Uno de los grupos más destacados, que será el impulsor de la revista individualista Ética será el Ateneo Naturista Ecléctico, con sede en Barcelona, con sus diferentes secciones la más destacada de las cuales será el grupo excursionista Sol y Vida.\"[  \"La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923–1938)\" by Xavier Díez\"Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related.\" [http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html \"Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism\" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

Published on Revista ADN. Winter 2003] \"The linking role played by the ‘Sol y Vida’ group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First Etica and then Iniciales, which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). \"I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.\". \"The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of Han Ryner) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, (Federación Anarquista Ibérica)\".\n\nIndividualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche \n\nThe thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been influential in individualist anarchism, specifically in thinkers such as France's Émile Armand,\"The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking.\"[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html Introduction to The Anarchism of Émile Armand by Émile Armand the Italian Renzo Novatore,[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html Toward the Creative Nothing] by Renzo Novatore and the Colombian Biofilo Panclasta.

He saw mutualism as the synthesis of \"liberty and order.\" His \"associationism ... is checked by individualism ... \"Mind your own business,\" \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces.

He syncretized Abolitionism, Free Love, spiritual universalism, (Josiah) Warren, & (Charles) Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy ... He was instrumental in founding several \"intentional communities,\" including the \"Brownstone Utopia\" on 14th St. in New York, & \"Modern Times\" in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts & the North American Phalanx in New Jersey)  –  in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for \"Free Love\") & finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity.

Voltairine de Cleyre, summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists \"are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State.\"de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Greene had been members of the socialist First International\n\nTwo individualist anarchists who wrote in Benjamin Tucker´s Liberty were also important labor organizers of the time. Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with \"the great natural laws ... without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes.\" However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads.Martin, James J. (1970). Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827–1908. Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher. Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetrators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president, and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers.\nA colleague of Labadie's at Liberty, Dyer Lum was another important individualist anarchist labor activist and poet of the era. A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including Mother Earth, Twentieth Century, and, The Alarm (the journal of the International Working People's Association) and The Open Court among others. Lum's political philosophy was a fusion of individualist anarchist economics – \"a radicalized form of laissez-faire economics\" inspired by the Boston anarchists – with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time. Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a \"mutualist\" theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political strategies in the American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism, and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum's fusion of individualist laissez-faire economics with radical labor activism as \"creative\" and described him as \"more significant than any in the Boston group\".\n\nAmerican egoism\n\nSome of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner's Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract.\" He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, \"In times past ... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off ... Man's only right to land is his might over it.\"Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350 In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.\"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?optioncom_staticxt&staticfile\nshow.php%3Ftitle1300&layout\nhtml#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]\n\n\"Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by Libertys presentation of egoism. They included: I published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of Liberty); The Ego and The Egoist, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German Der Eigene, edited by Adolf Brand, and The Eagle and The Serpent, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology.McElroy, Wendy.

Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker and Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton. John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called \"Egoism\" in which he states that \"Modern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual.\"[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/John_Beverley_Robinson__Egoism.html \"Egoism\"] by John Beverley Robinson James L.

In the 1910s he started becoming involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L' Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped on his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City.  His written works include The totalitarian nightmare (1975), The lunacy of the Superman (1977), Adventures in the country of the monoliths (1981) and Freedom: my dream (1986).\n\nAnarcho-capitalism\n\n19th century individualist anarchists espoused the labor theory of value. Many believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: \"Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists.\"Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, Blackwell Publishing, 2003, p. 13 As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined the Austrian school economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, , p. 290 In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that \"we are not anarchists ... but not archists either ... Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist,\" concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century).Rothbard, Murray.

SEK3). The goal of agorists is a society in which all \"relations between people are voluntary exchanges – a free market.\" Agorists are market anarchists. Most Agorists consider that property rights are natural rights deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, Agorists are divided on the question of intellectual property rights.\n\nThough anarcho-capitalism has been regarded by some as a form of individualist anarchism,* Alan and Trombley, Stephen (Eds.)

Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist nihilism, antirationalism, neo-primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-Situationist 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging Foucauldian 'personal insurrections'.\"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm by Murray Bookchin Post-left anarchist Bob Black in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called Anarchy after leftism said about post-left anarchy that \"It is, unlike Bookchinism, \"individualistic\" in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual – i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray – is not the measure of the good society, what is?\".[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Anarchy_after_Leftism.html#toc13 Anarchy after Leftism] by Bob Black\n\nA strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist Max Stirner.

Feral Faun wrote in 1995 that:\n\nIn the game of insurgence – a lived guerilla war game – it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them.

Proudhon was an early pioneer of anarchism as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of mutualism. Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work The Ego and Its Own which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.\" Another early figure was Anselme Bellegarrigue.[http://praxeology.net/MN-AB.htm Biography of Anselme Bellegarrigue by Max Nettlau.] IA expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from North American individualist anarchism.\n\nEuropean individualist anarchists include Albert Libertad,  Bellegarrigue, Oscar Wilde, Émile Armand, Lev Chernyi, John Henry Mackay, Han Ryner, Adolf Brand, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Renzo Novatore, and currently Michel Onfray.Onfray says in an interview \"L’individualisme anarchiste part de cette logique.

Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.\" Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Émile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.\"\n\nFrance\n\nFrom the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of French individualist anarchism. An early important individualist anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of 'Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique' and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States \"he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren.\" Autonomie Individuelle was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]\n\nLater, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as Albert Libertad, André Lorulot, Émile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean, who developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, L'Anarchie\"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, – 315 – L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history.\" Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 in 1905. Outside this journal, Han Ryner wrote Petit Manuel individualiste (1903). Later appeared the journal L'EnDehors created by Zo d'Axa in 1891.\n\n French individualist anarchists exposed a diversity of positions (per example, about violence and non-violence). For example, Émile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while becoming an important propagandist for free love, while Albert Libertad and Zo d'Axa were influential in violentists circles and championed violent propaganda by the deed while adhering to communitarianism or anarcho-communism \"Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l'anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l'individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme ; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal \"l'Anarchie\" dira \"Nous ne nous faisions pas d'illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l'individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression.\". Libertad s'associait à la dynamique de révolte individuelle radicale au projet d'émancipation collective. Il insistait sur la nécessité de développer le sentiment de camaraderie, afin de remplacer la concurrence qui était la morale de la société bourgeoise. \"[http://savoir.pingouin.org/index.php/Albert_Libertad \"Albert Libertad\"] and rejecting work. Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with stoicism. Nevertheless, French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. \"Along with feverish activity against the social order, (Albert) Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the \"joy of living\" and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society.\"[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Articles_from__Machete___1.html#toc1 \"Machete\" #1. \"Bonnot and the Evangelists\"]\n\nAnarchist naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle  and Georges Butaud.

The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of \"unions of egoists\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"La insumisión voluntaria.

Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of \"might\" rather than \"right\"; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal, although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed.

Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo, and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen, Estudios and Nosotros. The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.\n\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation.Xavier Diez.

The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy, and thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the establishment of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) in 1927.\n\nIn 1956, on exile escaping from Franco´s dictatorship Miguel Giménez Igualada published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds Anarchism in 1968, during his exile in Mexico from Franco's dictatorship in Spain.[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/caratula.html Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada] He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945.[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/indice.html Miguel Gimenez Igualada.

He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, Die Anarchisten and Der Freiheitsucher, contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker.[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html \"New England Anarchism in Germany\" by Thomas A.

Der Eigene concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider.

He writes:\n\nMax Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. Andrew Koch, for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Saul_Newman__War_on_the_State__Stirner_and_Deleuze_s_Anarchism.html \"War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism\"] by Saul Newman\n\nNewman has published several essays on Stirner. \"War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism\" and \"Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner\"\"Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner\" by Saul Newman discusses what he sees are similarities between Stirner's thought and that of Gilles Deleuze.

The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich \"The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois society political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society.\"\n\nSome Russian individualists anarchists \"found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained \"philosophical\" anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books.\"\n\nLev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolshevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Benjamin Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism, in which he advocated the \"free association of independent individuals.\".[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html \"Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians\"]  On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate \"for the seizure of private homes\", which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.\n\nChernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual. Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner, and Benjamin Tucker. Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities.\n\nOn the other hand, Aleksei Borovoi (1876?–1936),http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c\nlabadie;cclabadie;view\ntoc;idno2917084.0001.001 \"Anarchism and Law.\" on Anarchism Pamphlets in the Labadie Collection was a professor of philosophy at Moscow University, \"a gifted orator and the author of numerous books, pamphlets, and articles which attempted to reconcile individualist anarchism with the doctrines of syndicallism\". He wrote among other theoretical works, Anarkhizm in 1918 just after the October revolution and Anarchism and Law. For him \"the chief importance is given not to Anarchism as the aim but to Anarchy as the continuous quest for the aim\".[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/228105 Alexei Borovoi (from individualism to the Platform)\" by Anatoly Dubovik] He manifests there that \"No social ideal, from the point of view of anarchism, could be referred to as absolute in a sense that supposes it's the crown of human wisdom, the end of social and ethical quest of man.\"\n\nLatin American individualist anarchism\n\nArgentine anarchist historian Angel Cappelletti reports that in Argentina \"Among the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established ... affinity groups that in 1912 came to, according to Max Nettlau, to the number of 20.  In 1911 there appeared, in Colón, the periodical El Único, that defined itself as ‘Publicación individualista’\".\n\nVicente Rojas Lizcano, whose pseudonym was Biófilo Panclasta, was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist. In 1904 he began using the name Biofilo Panclasta. \"Biofilo\" in Spanish stands for \"lover of life\" and \"Panclasta\" for \"enemy of all\".. He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietszche. Among his written works there are Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado(1932) and Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and vagabond, as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.\n\nMaria Lacerda de Moura was a Brazilian teacher, journalist, anarcha-feminist, and individualist anarchist. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by Francisco Ferrer. She later moved to São Paulo and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press. There she also lectured on topics including education, women's rights, free love, and antimilitarism. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. In February 1923, she launched Renascença, a periodical linked with the anarchist, progressive, and freethinking circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by individualist anarchists such as Han Ryner and Émile Armand. She maintained contact with Spanish individualist anarchist circles.\n\nHorst Matthai Quelle was a Spanish language German anarchist philosopher influenced by Max Stirner.[https://books.google.com/books?id\nE6JFPiDRlikC&pgPA345&lpg\nPA345&dqhorst+matthai+el+humanismo+como+problema+humano&source\nbl&otsxIM4vDCSEI&sig\n0JsjtOCI9YAUUYK7duEnZGj7Skw&hles#v\nonepage&qhorst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano&f\ntrue Horst Matthai Quelle. Textos Filosóficos (1989–1999). p. 15] In 1938, at the beginning of the German economic crisis and the rise of Nazism and fascism in Europe, Quelle moved to Mexico. Quelle earned his undergraduate degree, master's and doctorate in philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he returned as a professor of philosophy in the 1980s. He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe. One of his main views was a \"theory of infinite worlds\" which for him was developed by pre-socratic philosophers.\n\nDuring the 1990s in Argentina, there appeared a stirnerist publication called El Único: publicacion periódica de pensamiento individualista.\n\nCriticisms\n\nPhilosopher Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to democracy and its embrace of \"lifestylism\" at the expense of class struggle. Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only negative liberty and rejects the idea of positive liberty.Bookchin, Murray. \"Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism\". Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998. AK Press, 1999, p. 155 Philosopher Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism, and that it \"is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'.\" He claimed that Benjamin Tucker's acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the \"employer's 'freedom'\") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as \"no government.\"Meltzer, Albert. Anarchism: Arguments For and Against. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114–15\n\nPhilosopher George Bernard Shaw initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was \"the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it.\" Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of laissez-faire advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation.Griffith, Gareth. Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310 According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they \"do not see that as an injustice.\"Anderson, Carlotta R. All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement, Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250 Tucker explained, \"If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living.\"Tucker, Benjamin. Economic Rent.\n\nFootnotes\n\nα The term \"individualist anarchism\" is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as An Anarchist FAQ use the classification \"social anarchism / individualist anarchism\". Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist, and use the classification \"socialist anarchism / individualist anarchism\" accordingly.Ostergaard, Geoffrey. \"Anarchism\". The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 14. Other classifications include \"mutualist/communal\" anarchism.Carson, Kevin, [http://www.mutualist.org/id24.html \"A Mutualist FAQ\"].\nβ Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates self-government with a \"progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others.\" The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of Egoism, as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is \"found in Herbert Spencer's early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as Donisthorpe, foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution.\" The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.\nγSee, for example, the Winter 2006 issue of the Journal of Libertarian Studies, dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy. Mutualists compose one bloc, along with agorists and geo-libertarians, in the recently formed Alliance of the Libertarian Left.\nδ Though this term is non-standard usage – by \"left\" – agorists mean \"left\" in the general sense used by left-libertarians, as defined by Roderick T. Long, as \"... an integration, or I'd argue, a reintegration of libertarianism with concerns that are traditionally thought of as being concerns of the left. That includes concerns for worker empowerment, worry about plutocracy, concerns about feminism and various kinds of social equality.\"Long, Roderick. T.

Benjamin R. Tucker, a famous 19th-century individualist anarchist, held that \"if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny.\"\n\nOverview\n\nAmong the early influences on individualist anarchism were William Godwin, Josiah Warren (\"sovereignty of the individual\"), Max Stirner (egoism), Lysander Spooner (\"natural law\"), Pierre Joseph Proudhon (mutualism), Henry David Thoreau (transcendentalism),\"Paralelamente, al otro lado del atlántico, en el diferente contexto de una nación a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros filósofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

The concentration on the individual and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.\"En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, \"más allá del bien y del mal\" como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)\"] \"Stirner himself, however, has no truck with \"higher beings.\" Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all \"higher beings,\" regarding them as a variety of what he calls \"spooks,\" or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God . . . it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism.

The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today.\"The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists' use of direct action to create revolutionary situations.\"[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca31 \"A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?\"]  in An Anarchist FAQ\"Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria.

The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution.

The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists.Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone \"uniones de egoístas\", formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] \"The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would \"care best for their welfare if they unite with others.\" [p. 309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls \"intercourse,\" or \"union\" between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p. 218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n\n\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character ... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist? ...

To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but \"the individuals are its reality\"  –  he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.\"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as I entitle, that is, empower myself to take…\" From The Ego and Its Own, quoted in  Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw \"associations of egoists\" drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, American individualist anarchism \"stresses the isolation of the individual  –  his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is \"aesthetic\" anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War.\"[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism by Eunice Minette Schuster]  It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account \"the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society ... the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production).

The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs.\" and so \"Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal socialism ... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism.\"[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 \"G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?\"] in An Anarchist FAQ Contemporary individualist anarchist Kevin Carson characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that \"Unlike the rest of the socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business.\" Kevin Carson. Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1\n\nIn European individualist anarchism a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such \"The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run.\"[https://archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry.

Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted \"amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general.\"\nAs such Murray Bookchin describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who \"expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing.\".[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 \"2.

There are adherents to mutualism (Proudhon, Émile Armand, early Benjamin Tucker), egoistic disrespect for \"ghosts\" such as private property and markets (Stirner, John Henry Mackay, Lev Chernyi, later Tucker), and adherents to anarcho-communism (Albert Libertad, illegalism, Renzo Novatore).\"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy.

Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.\"Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html \"Anarchism\"], Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society. \"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…\" – footnote, Ch. 2 Political Justice by William Godwin. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.\"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Godwin, William]\". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us \"of more worth and importance' than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good. Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to \"private judgement\" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.\n\nGodwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that \"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.\" The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority, though he believed it to be preferable to dictatorship.\n\nGodwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as \"the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry.\" However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. This was to be based on utilitarian principles; he said: \"Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated.\" However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual \"private judgement.\" He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarchist communism.\n\nGodwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the Socialist Standard, organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;\"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism\" by ALB, The Socialist Standard Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the \"founder of communist anarchism\";Rothbard, Murray. \"[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html Edmund Burke, Anarchist].\" and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of \"private judgement\" and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice. Many of Godwin's views changed over time, as noted by Kropotkin.\n\nWilliam Godwin's influenced \"the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism).\"[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini. \"Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy\"]\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an \"anarchist.\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml \"Anarchism\"], BBC Radio 4 program, In Our Time, Thursday December 7, 2006. Hosted by Melvyn Bragg of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at University of Westminster, Ruth Kinna, Senior Lecturer in Politics at Loughborough University, and Peter Marshall, philosopher and historian. Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist, while others regard him to be a social anarchist.Bowen, James & Purkis, Jon. 2004.

Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20 Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana,Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his \"Bank of the People\"] (1848). and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker.Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online\np. 1\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property.\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarchist-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.\" An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation ...\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006).  p. 217 and famously declared that \"property is theft!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists, who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon, and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin, while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\nMutualism\n\nMutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market.[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction] Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\".Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 & 22.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Meek & Oppenheimer). Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 19.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb & Oppenheimer). Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: \"... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all.\"Solution of the Social Problem, 1848–49.\n\nInsofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor.  However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession.\")Swartz, Clarence Lee.

However, \"some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term \"socialist.\" But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right.\"[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?]  Mutualists have distinguished themselves from state socialism, and don't advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that \"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few ... by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost.\"\n\nMax Stirner\n\nJohann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the nom de plume he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German 'Stirn'), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, which translates literally as The Only One [individual] and his Property). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig, and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.\n\nEgoism \n\nMax Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called \"egoism,\" is a form of individualist anarchism. Max Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose \"name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism.\" In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige and sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and His Property)Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177 was published, which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.\" Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests.Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190 He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to \"a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling,\" saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather \"lives themselves out\" without regard to \"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby.\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual's power to obtain what he desires.The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions – including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society – were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to \"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members.\"Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96 Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Unions of Egoists, non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the state. A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. Even murder is permissible \"if it is right for me,\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191 though it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.\n\nFor Stirner, property simply comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.\" And, \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.\" He says, \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\".Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248 His concept of \"egoistic property\" not only a lack of moral restraint on how one obtains and uses things, but includes other people as well.Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194 His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin's altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.\n\nThis position on property is much different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through laborWeir, David. Anarchy & Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146 and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, \"with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself.\"McElroy, Wendy.

Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora Marsden and John Beverly Robinson.\n\nIn Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.Levy, Carl. \"[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_1/Anarchism.html Anarchism]\".

Russian Review, Vol. 26, No. 4. (Oct., 1967). p. 343 This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman\n\nThough Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. \"For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management\" discusses Stirner and speaks of a \"communist egoism,\" which is said to be a \"synthesis of individualism and collectivism,\" and says that \"greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society.\"For Ourselves,  The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything, 1974. Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are influenced by Stirner.see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88. Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays.Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50.\n\nEarly American individualist anarchism \n\nJosiah Warren \n\n Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist,Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], Slate.com and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published,William Bailie,  Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist  –  A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20 an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates.\nWarren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase \"Cost the limit of price,\" with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.\"A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals…\". Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce.\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included \"Utopia\" and \"Modern Times.\" Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.Charles A. Madison. \"Anarchism in the United States\". Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1945), p. 53 Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them.\n\nHenry David Thoreau \n\n Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later naturist currents, simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. \"Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.\"\n\nThe essay Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican–American War. The essay later influenced Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy through its advocacy of nonviolent resistance.[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard] It is also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty. Some individualist anarchists, such as Thoreau,Johnson, Ellwood. The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature, Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138.Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, edited by Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12. do not speak of economics but simply the right of \"disunion\" from the state, and foresee the gradual elimination of the state through social evolution.\n\nDevelopments and expansion\n\nFree love, anarcha-feminism and LGBT issues\n\nAn important current within individualist anarchism is free love.[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy] Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women.

Armand and \"la camaraderie amoureuse\". Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy] He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.

A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\".Wendy McElroy [https://mises.org/library/culture-individualist-anarchism-late-19th-century-america \"The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America\"] \"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty ... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\".\n\nIn Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. \"Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church ... Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in Estudios (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.\" This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine Ética and Iniciales \"there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.\".\n\nAnarcho-naturism\n\nAnother important current, especially within French and Spanish\"Proliferarán así diversos grupos que practicarán el excursionismo, el naturismo, el nudismo, la emancipación sexual o el esperantismo, alrededor de asociaciones informales vinculadas de una manera o de otra al anarquismo.

The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First Etica and then Iniciales, which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). \"I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.\". \"The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of Han Ryner) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, (Federación Anarquista Ibérica)\".\n\nIndividualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche \n\nThe thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been influential in individualist anarchism, specifically in thinkers such as France's Émile Armand,\"The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson.

He saw mutualism as the synthesis of \"liberty and order.\" His \"associationism ... is checked by individualism ... \"Mind your own business,\" \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces.

He syncretized Abolitionism, Free Love, spiritual universalism, (Josiah) Warren, & (Charles) Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy ... He was instrumental in founding several \"intentional communities,\" including the \"Brownstone Utopia\" on 14th St. in New York, & \"Modern Times\" in Brentwood, Long Island.

Voltairine de Cleyre, summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists \"are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State.\"de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Greene had been members of the socialist First International\n\nTwo individualist anarchists who wrote in Benjamin Tucker´s Liberty were also important labor organizers of the time. Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with \"the great natural laws ... without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes.\" However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads.Martin, James J. (1970). Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827–1908. Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher. Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetrators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president, and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers.\nA colleague of Labadie's at Liberty, Dyer Lum was another important individualist anarchist labor activist and poet of the era. A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including Mother Earth, Twentieth Century, and, The Alarm (the journal of the International Working People's Association) and The Open Court among others. Lum's political philosophy was a fusion of individualist anarchist economics – \"a radicalized form of laissez-faire economics\" inspired by the Boston anarchists – with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time. Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a \"mutualist\" theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political strategies in the American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism, and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum's fusion of individualist laissez-faire economics with radical labor activism as \"creative\" and described him as \"more significant than any in the Boston group\".\n\nAmerican egoism\n\nSome of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner's Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract.\" He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, \"In times past ... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off ... Man's only right to land is his might over it.\"Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350 In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.\"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?optioncom_staticxt&staticfile\nshow.php%3Ftitle1300&layout\nhtml#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]\n\n\"Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by Libertys presentation of egoism. They included: I published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of Liberty); The Ego and The Egoist, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German Der Eigene, edited by Adolf Brand, and The Eagle and The Serpent, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology.McElroy, Wendy.

Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker and Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton. John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called \"Egoism\" in which he states that \"Modern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more.

In the 1910s he started becoming involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L' Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped on his release by Emma Goldman.

Many believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: \"Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists.\"Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, Blackwell Publishing, 2003, p. 13 As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined the Austrian school economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, , p. 290 In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that \"we are not anarchists ... but not archists either ...

However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism.

SEK3). The goal of agorists is a society in which all \"relations between people are voluntary exchanges – a free market.\" Agorists are market anarchists. Most Agorists consider that property rights are natural rights deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, Agorists are divided on the question of intellectual property rights.\n\nThough anarcho-capitalism has been regarded by some as a form of individualist anarchism,* Alan and Trombley, Stephen (Eds.)

Unlike right-libertarians, they believe that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights, and maintain that natural resources (land, oil, gold, trees) ought to be held in some egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.  Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the local community.\n\nPost-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism \n\nMurray Bookchin has identified post-left anarchy as a form of individualist anarchism in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm where he identifies \"a shift among Euro-American anarchists away from social anarchism and toward individualist or lifestyle anarchism. Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist nihilism, antirationalism, neo-primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-Situationist 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging Foucauldian 'personal insurrections'.\"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm by Murray Bookchin Post-left anarchist Bob Black in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called Anarchy after leftism said about post-left anarchy that \"It is, unlike Bookchinism, \"individualistic\" in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual – i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray – is not the measure of the good society, what is?\".[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Anarchy_after_Leftism.html#toc13 Anarchy after Leftism] by Bob Black\n\nA strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist Max Stirner. Jason McQuinn says that \"when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner.\"What is Ideology?\" by Jason McQuinn Also Bob Black and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher strongly adhere to stirnerist egoist anarchism. Bob Black has humorously suggested the idea of \"marxist stirnerism\".[http://sniggle.net/Manifesti/groucho.php \"Theses on Groucho Marxism\" by Bob Black\n\nHakim Bey has said \"From Stirner's \"Union of Self-Owning Ones\" we proceed to Nietzsche's circle of \"Free Spirits\" and thence to Charles Fourier's \"Passional Series\", doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group.\"[http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm Immediatism by Hakim Bey.

Dyer Lum, Ezra & Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; Jo Labadie, who wrote for Tucker's Liberty, made himself a link between the American \"plumb-line\" anarchists, the \"philosophical\" individualists, & the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance.

Some thoughts on creating anarchy\" by Feral Faun and has translated both Novatore.[http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/creativenothing.htm Towards the creative nothing and other writings by Renzo Novatore]  and the young Italian individualist anarchist Bruno Filippi\n\nKevin Carson is a contemporary mutualist economist and author of Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.[http://www.mutualist.org/id47.html.Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]. Kevin Carson Contemporary mutualists are among those involved in the Alliance of the Libertarian Left and in the Voluntary Cooperation Movement.\n\nEgoism has had a strong influence on insurrectionary anarchism, as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher. Feral Faun wrote in 1995 that:\n\nIn the game of insurgence – a lived guerilla war game – it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, Feral Faun, became ... an anarchist ... a writer ... a Stirner-influenced, post-situationist, anti-civilization theorist ... if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Feral_Faun__Essays.html#toc10 \"The Last Word\" by Feral Faun]\n\nEuropean individualist anarchism\n\nEuropean individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by William Godwin, Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Max Stirner. Proudhon was an early pioneer of anarchism as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of mutualism. Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work The Ego and Its Own which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.\" Another early figure was Anselme Bellegarrigue.[http://praxeology.net/MN-AB.htm Biography of Anselme Bellegarrigue by Max Nettlau.] IA expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from North American individualist anarchism.\n\nEuropean individualist anarchists include Albert Libertad,  Bellegarrigue, Oscar Wilde, Émile Armand, Lev Chernyi, John Henry Mackay, Han Ryner, Adolf Brand, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Renzo Novatore, and currently Michel Onfray.Onfray says in an interview \"L’individualisme anarchiste part de cette logique. Il célèbre les individualités ...

Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)\" by Xavier Diez]  anarcho-naturism, and illegalism.\n\"Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.\" Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Émile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.\"\n\nFrance\n\nFrom the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of French individualist anarchism. An early important individualist anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of 'Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique' and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States \"he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren.\" Autonomie Individuelle was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]\n\nLater, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as Albert Libertad, André Lorulot, Émile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean, who developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, L'Anarchie\"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, – 315 – L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history.\" Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 in 1905. Outside this journal, Han Ryner wrote Petit Manuel individualiste (1903). Later appeared the journal L'EnDehors created by Zo d'Axa in 1891.\n\n French individualist anarchists exposed a diversity of positions (per example, about violence and non-violence). For example, Émile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while becoming an important propagandist for free love, while Albert Libertad and Zo d'Axa were influential in violentists circles and championed violent propaganda by the deed while adhering to communitarianism or anarcho-communism \"Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l'anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l'individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme ; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal \"l'Anarchie\" dira \"Nous ne nous faisions pas d'illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l'individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression.\". Libertad s'associait à la dynamique de révolte individuelle radicale au projet d'émancipation collective. Il insistait sur la nécessité de développer le sentiment de camaraderie, afin de remplacer la concurrence qui était la morale de la société bourgeoise. \"[http://savoir.pingouin.org/index.php/Albert_Libertad \"Albert Libertad\"] and rejecting work. Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with stoicism. Nevertheless, French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. \"Along with feverish activity against the social order, (Albert) Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the \"joy of living\" and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society.\"[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Articles_from__Machete___1.html#toc1 \"Machete\" #1. \"Bonnot and the Evangelists\"]\n\nAnarchist naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle  and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist \"partisan of the milieux libres, publisher of \"Flambeau\" (\"an enemy of authority\") in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several.[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm \"1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont.\"]\n\n\"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of \"unions of egoists\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"La insumisión voluntaria.

Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of \"might\" rather than \"right\"; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal, although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed.

Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo, and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen, Estudios and Nosotros. The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.\n\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation.Xavier Diez.

His thought was deeply influenced by Max Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his own writings.

He proposed the creation of a Union of Egoists, to be a Federation of Individualist Anarchists in Spain, but did not succeed.\"A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez]  In 1956 he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l147.pdf \"Stirner\" por Miguel Gimenez Igualada] Afterwards he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.\n\nFederico Urales was an important individualist anarchist who edited La Revista Blanca. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy, and thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the establishment of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) in 1927.\n\nIn 1956, on exile escaping from Franco´s dictatorship Miguel Giménez Igualada published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds Anarchism in 1968, during his exile in Mexico from Franco's dictatorship in Spain.[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/caratula.html Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada] He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945.[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/indice.html Miguel Gimenez Igualada.

He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, Die Anarchisten and Der Freiheitsucher, contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker.[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html \"New England Anarchism in Germany\" by Thomas A. Riley]  McKay is also known as an important European early activist for Gay rights.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe (Books of the Nameless Love). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the Fenny Skaller, a story of a pederast.[http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf thamyris 02]  Under the same pseudonym he also published fiction, such as Holland (1924) and a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, Der Puppenjunge (The Hustler) (1926).\n\n Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirnerist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. Brand published a German homosexual periodical, Der Eigene in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world.Karl Heinrich Ulrichs had begun a journal called Prometheus in 1870, but only one issue was published. (Kennedy, Hubert, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality, In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997. The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher Max Stirner, who had greatly influenced the young Brand, and refers to Stirner's concept of \"self-ownership\" of the individual. Der Eigene concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider.

He writes:\n\nMax Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power.

The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich \"The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois society political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society.\"\n\nSome Russian individualists anarchists \"found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained \"philosophical\" anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books.\"\n\nLev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolshevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Benjamin Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism, in which he advocated the \"free association of independent individuals.\".[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html \"Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians\"]  On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate \"for the seizure of private homes\", which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.\n\nChernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual. Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner, and Benjamin Tucker. Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities.\n\nOn the other hand, Aleksei Borovoi (1876?–1936),http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c\nlabadie;cclabadie;view\ntoc;idno2917084.0001.001 \"Anarchism and Law.\" on Anarchism Pamphlets in the Labadie Collection was a professor of philosophy at Moscow University, \"a gifted orator and the author of numerous books, pamphlets, and articles which attempted to reconcile individualist anarchism with the doctrines of syndicallism\".

He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietszche. Among his written works there are Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado(1932) and Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and vagabond, as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.\n\nMaria Lacerda de Moura was a Brazilian teacher, journalist, anarcha-feminist, and individualist anarchist. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by Francisco Ferrer. She later moved to São Paulo and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press.

Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. In February 1923, she launched Renascença, a periodical linked with the anarchist, progressive, and freethinking circles of the period.

He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe. One of his main views was a \"theory of infinite worlds\" which for him was developed by pre-socratic philosophers.\n\nDuring the 1990s in Argentina, there appeared a stirnerist publication called El Único: publicacion periódica de pensamiento individualista.\n\nCriticisms\n\nPhilosopher Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to democracy and its embrace of \"lifestylism\" at the expense of class struggle. Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only negative liberty and rejects the idea of positive liberty.Bookchin, Murray. \"Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism\". Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998. AK Press, 1999, p. 155 Philosopher Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism, and that it \"is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'.\" He claimed that Benjamin Tucker's acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the \"employer's 'freedom'\") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as \"no government.\"Meltzer, Albert. Anarchism: Arguments For and Against. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114–15\n\nPhilosopher George Bernard Shaw initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was \"the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it.\" Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of laissez-faire advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation.Griffith, Gareth. Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310 According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they \"do not see that as an injustice.\"Anderson, Carlotta R. All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement, Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250 Tucker explained, \"If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living.\"Tucker, Benjamin. Economic Rent.\n\nFootnotes\n\nα The term \"individualist anarchism\" is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as An Anarchist FAQ use the classification \"social anarchism / individualist anarchism\". Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist, and use the classification \"socialist anarchism / individualist anarchism\" accordingly.Ostergaard, Geoffrey. \"Anarchism\". The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 14. Other classifications include \"mutualist/communal\" anarchism.Carson, Kevin, [http://www.mutualist.org/id24.html \"A Mutualist FAQ\"].\nβ Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates self-government with a \"progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others.\" The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of Egoism, as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is \"found in Herbert Spencer's early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as Donisthorpe, foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution.\" The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.\nγSee, for example, the Winter 2006 issue of the Journal of Libertarian Studies, dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy. Mutualists compose one bloc, along with agorists and geo-libertarians, in the recently formed Alliance of the Libertarian Left.\nδ Though this term is non-standard usage – by \"left\" – agorists mean \"left\" in the general sense used by left-libertarians, as defined by Roderick T. Long, as \"... an integration, or I'd argue, a reintegration of libertarianism with concerns that are traditionally thought of as being concerns of the left. That includes concerns for worker empowerment, worry about plutocracy, concerns about feminism and various kinds of social equality.\"Long, Roderick. T.

An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 61. (Used synonymously with \"individualist anarchism\" when referring to individualist anarchism that supports a market society)\"One is anarcho-capitalism, a form of libertarian anarchism which demands that the state should be abolished and that private individuals and firms should control social and economic affairs\" (Barbara Goodwin, \"Using Political Ideas\", fourth edition, John Wiley & Sons (1987), pp. 137–38)\"the 'libertarian anarchist' could on the face of it either be in favour of capitalism or against it ... Pro-capitalist anarchism, is as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the U.S. where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be.\" Tormey, Simon, Anti-Capitalism, A Beginner's Guide, Oneworld Publications, 2004, pp. 118–19\"Friedman presents practical and economic arguments for both libertarianism in general and libertarian anarchism, which he calls anarcho-capitalism.\" Burton, Daniel C.
