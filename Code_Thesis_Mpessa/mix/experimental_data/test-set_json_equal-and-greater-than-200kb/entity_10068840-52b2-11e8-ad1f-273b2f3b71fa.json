Following the elections, the Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) made future foreign assistance to the PA conditional upon the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those changes, which led to the Quartet suspending its foreign assistance program and Israel imposing economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance.\n* [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/hamas/index.html Hamas] The New York Times, June 18, 2010 \"The pact did not succeed in restoring the flow of aid and did not last.

Israel and Egypt then imposed an economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, on the grounds that Fatah forces were no longer providing security there.

The Arabic word 'hamas' (حماس) means \"courage\" or \"zeal\".Martha Crenshaw, John Pimlott. [https://books.google.com/books?idj4p4CAAAQBAJ&pg\nPT415 International Encyclopedia of Terrorism].

[https://books.google.com/books?id\nrzRpCwAAQBAJ&pgPA150  Hamas: Terrorism, Governance, and Its Future in Middle East Politics]. ABC-CLIO. 2016. p. 119.\n\nAims\n\nHamas, as its name (Islamic Resistance Movement) implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation by resisting it. And according to Hamas armed branch Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades:\n\nAl-Qassam Brigades aims to liberate all of Palestine from what they describe as Zionist occupation, and to achieve the rights of the Palestinian people that were robbed by the occupation, and it consider itself part of the movement of a project of national liberation.[http://www.alqassam.ps/arabic/#!/%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%86/ ]\n\nLeadership and structure\n\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council. Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (dawah); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (al-Mujahideen al Filastinun); (c) a security service (Jehaz Aman); and (d) a media branch (A’alam).Levitt 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA11 pp.10–11]. Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (Kuwaidia) under Khaled Mashal.Levitt, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA11 pp.11–12]. The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the Gulf States after its leader Mashal broke with Yasser Arafat's decision to side with Saddam Hussein in the Invasion of Kuwait, with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw.Sara Roy, [https://books.google.com/books?idmX1dAAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA30 Hamas and Civil Society in Gaza: Engaging the Islamist Social Sector,] Princeton University Press, Rev.ed. 2013 p.30. On 6 May 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniya to become the new leader, to replace Mashal.\n\nThe exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities. Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. Communication between the political and military wings of Hamas is difficult, owing to the thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and the existence of an extensive base of informants. After the assassination of Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.Davis 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA44 pp.44–45].\n\nConsultative councils\n\nThe governing body is the Majlis al-Shura. The principle behind the Council is based on the Qur'anic concept of consultation and popular assembly (shura), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework.A. Hovdenak, 'Hamas in Transition:The Failure of Sanctions,' in Michelle Pace, Peter Seeberg (eds.),  [https://books.google.com/books?idRgLcAAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA64 The European Union's Democratization Agenda in the Mediterranean,] Routledge, 2013 pp.50–79 p.64. As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased it needed a broader base for decisions, the Shura Council was renamed the 'General Consultative Council', elected from members of local council groups and this in turn elected a 15-member Politburo (al-Maktab al-Siyasi)Peter Mandaville,[https://books.google.com/books?id2bvcAwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA282 Islam and Politics,] Routledge, 2014 Rev.ed, p.282. that made decisions at the highest level.

This organ was located in Damascus until the Syrian Civil War led it to transfer to Qatar in January 2012, when Hamas sided with the civil opposition against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.Mohammed Ayoob, [https://books.google.com/books?idph6eAgAAQBAJ&pg\nPT47 Will the Middle East Implode?,] John Wiley & Sons, 2014 p.47.\n\nSocial Services Wing\n\nHamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.For them, charity and the development of one's community are prescribed by religion, and, at the same time, are to be understood as forms of resistance.Tristan Dunning,[https://books.google.com/books?id4jp-CwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA136 p.136.] In Islamic tradition dawah (lit.'the call to God') obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both waqf endowment resources and charitable donations (zakat) to fund grassroots services like nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA16 pp.16–23]. In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services.Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA78 p.78] It has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine. By 2000 it or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005 was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza.Lihi Ben Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nzUjuCQAAQBAJ&pgPA71 Righteous Transgressions: Women's Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right,] Princeton University Press, 2015 p.71. Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt.David L. Phillips,[https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA75 From Bullets to Ballots: Violent Muslim Movements in Transition,] Transaction Publishers, 2011 p.75. As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions like financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction. A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 pp.47ff].\n\nThe dawah infrastructure itself was understood, within the Palestinian context, as providing the soil from which a militant opposition to the occupation would flower.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA16 p.23]:'In a 1995 lecture, Sheikh Jamil Hamami, a party to the foundation of Hamas and a senior member of its West Bank leadership, expounded the importance of Hamas' dawa infrastructure as the soil from which militancy would flower.' In this regard it differs from the rival Palestinian Islamic Jihad which lacks any social welfare network, and relies on spectacular terrorist attacks to recruit adherents.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA26 pp.25–26]. In 2007, through funding from Iran, Hamas managed to allocate at a cost of $60 million, monthly stipends of $100 for 100,000 workers, and a similar sum for 3,000 fishermen laid idle by Israel's imposition of restrictions on fishing offshore, plus grants totalling $45 million to detainees and their families.Mohsen Saleh, [https://books.google.com/books?idLGVkCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA198 The Palestinian Strategic Report 2006,] Al Manhal, 2007 p.198. Matthew Levitt argues that Hamas grants to people are subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of how beneficiaries will support Hamas, with those linked to terrorist activities receiving more than others.James J. F. Forrest, 'Conclusion', in James Dingley, [https://books.google.com/books?idCVJ_AgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA290 Combating Terrorism in Northern Ireland,]  Routledge, 2008 pp.280–300 p.290. Israel holds the families of suicide bombers accountable and bulldozes their homes, whereas the families of Hamas activists who have been killed or wounded during militant operations are given an initial, one-time grant varying between $500–$5,000, together with a $100 monthly allowance. Rent assistance is also given to families whose homes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing though families unaffiliated with Hamas are said to receive less.Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA81 p.81].Levitt, pp. 122–123.\n\nUntil 2007, these activities extended to the West Bank, but, after a PLO crackdown, now continue exclusively in the Gaza Strip.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 p.48]. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état deposed the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsi in 2013, Hamas found itself in a financial straightjacket and has since endeavoured to throw the burden of responsibility for public works infrastructure in the Gaza Strip back onto the Palestinian National Authority, but without success.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 pp.48–49].\n\nMilitary wing\n\nThe Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing was formed in either mid-1991Aoibhín de Búrca, [https://books.google.com/books?idLCJHBQAAQBAJ&pg\nPA100 Preventing Political Violence Against Civilians: Nationalist Militant Conflict in Northern Ireland, Israel And Palestine,] Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 pp.100–102.Mohammad Najib and Roland Friedrich 'Non-Statutory Armed Groups and Security Sector Governance,' in Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold  (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id\nicV4k__xMmgC&pgPA106  Entry-points to Palestinian Security Sector Reform,] DCAF, 2007 pp.101–127 p.103.This date is based on a Hamas operation that assassinated the rabbi of the Israeli settlement of Kfar Darom inside the Gaza Strip. or 1992, under the direction of Yahya Ayyash, a Hamas field-commander and bomb-maker assassinated by Israel in 1996. It was constituted from units associated with the earlier al-Jihad wa Da’wa, an umbrella group that had gathered in militants from various Islamic resistance cells like the Al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun (Palestinian fighters).Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nbmaFCwAAQBAJ&pgPT110 pp.110–111]. established by Salah Shehade in 1986.Najib p.103.\n\nThe wing takes its name from the prewar militant Palestinian nationalist Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, though Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as \"Students of Ayyash\", \"Students of the Engineer\", or \"Yahya Ayyash Units\". At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions. This approach had been justified two years earlier when, in the wake of the killing of some 20 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces dispersing protestors at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1990, Hamas had declared every Israeli soldier a legitimate target.Alincée Van Engeland,'Hamas,' in Jeffrey Ian Ross (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?idMFfrBgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA319 Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present,] Routledge 2015 pp.319–323: p.319.\n\nAyyash, with a degree in electrical engineering, quickly improved Hamas's strike capacity by developing IEDs and promoting the tactic of suicide bombings.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idbmaFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPT110 p.111]. By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1, which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried.Mohannad Sabry,[https://books.google.com/books?idydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA65 Sinai: Egypt's Linchpin, Gaza's Lifeline, Israel's Nightmare], British Academic Press, 2015, p. 65. Over the next five years of the conflict, a 3-kilogram-warhead-armed version with a strike range of 6–8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also producedNajib p. 107 and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip: 4 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 155 in 2003, 281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12–14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel.Sabry p. 67. During the War with Israel in 2008–2009, Hamas deployed 122-mm Grad rocketry with a 20–40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided Kornet antitank missiles.Sabry, [https://books.google.com/books?idydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA73 p.73]. By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the Fajr-5 rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as Tel Aviv, as was shown after the assassination of Ahmed Jabari in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa.Jefferis,[https://books.google.com/books?idrzRpCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA119 p.119]. Hamas deployed its increasingly sophisticated rocketry to replace its martyrdom operations.Najib p. 107.\n\nWhile the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive military style training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War).Mathieu Guidère, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ntCvhzGiDMYsC&pgPA173  Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism,] Scarecrow Press, 2012 p.173. Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives,Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nzUjuCQAAQBAJ&pgPA71 p.71].Najib p.106. forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for two years.\n\nThe group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:\n\nTo evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.Najib p.105.\nAccording to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers, and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.Najib pp. 105–106.\n\nIn practice, Hamas altered its approach restricting actions to 'legitimate military targets' by extended them to Israeli civilians after 7 years. Though between 1996 and 2001 it generally refrained from targeting Israeli civilians,Najib p.106 it adopted sporadic suicide bombings in the wake of the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, when an Israeli settler in military fatigues, Baruch Goldstein, shot dead 29 Muslims at prayer in 1993.R.Kim Cragin,'Learning to Survive:The Case of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)', in James JF Forrest (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1R79AAAAQBAJ&pgPA199 Teaching Terror: Strategic and Tactical Learning in the Terrorist World,] Rowman & Littlefield, 2006 pp.189–204 p.196.Erlich Reese, Robert Baer, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n2gZZCwAAQBAJ&pgPA26 Conversations with Terrorists: Middle East Leaders on Politics, Violence, and Empire,] Routledge, 2016 p.28.Dunning, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4jp-CwAAQBAJ&pgPA30 p.34]. After the Al Aqsa revolt, the Brigades were behind most of the suicide bombings in Israel, a measure it defended as a form of \"reciprocity\".\n\nDown to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from Yahya Ayyash (5 January 1996), it has lost Emad Akel (24 November 1993) Salah Shehade, (23 July 2002), Ibrahim al-Makadmeh, (8 March 2003) Ismail Abu Shanab, (21 August 2003) Ahmed Yassin (March 22, 2004) and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi,( April 17, 2004).,Harry Raymond Hueston, Paul G.

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4–5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions. Unlike the political section, which is split between an internal and external structure, the Brigades are under a local Palestinian leadership, and disobedience with the decisions taken by the political leadership have been relatively rare.Najib pp.107-108-\n\nAlthough the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated.

Matthew Levitt on the other hand argues vocally for the idea that Hamas's welfare institutions act as a mere façade or front for the financing of terrorism, and dismisses the idea of two wings as a 'myth'.Julie C.Herrick,'Non-State Actors: A Comparative Analysis of Change and Development Within Hamas and Hezbollah,' in Bahgat Korany (ed.),  [https://books.google.com/books?id\nxyMjPQDzIp8C&pgPA179  The Changing Middle East: A New Look at Regional Dynamics,] American University in Cairo Press, 2010 pp.167–195, p.179.

Hamas is one body.\"Matthew Levitt [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA34 p.34].\n\nFinances and funding\n\nAt the 1993 Philadelphia conference, Hamas leaders' statements indicated that they read George H. W. Bush's outline of a New World Order as embodying a tacit aim to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad in the occupying territories.Levitt p. 148.\n\nHamas's budget, calculated to be roughly US$70 million (2011), is derived in large part (85%) from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources. Only two Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the other contributors were donor bodies located in Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt states that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror,Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&pgPA143 pp. 143–144]. and is believed to engage in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud. Vittori states that, more than other similar organizations, it is particularly careful about keeping resources for its militant, political and public works activities separate. The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief.Colin P. Clarke, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nPJRzCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 Terrorism, Inc.: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare], ABC-CLIO, 2015 p. 97. Between 1992 and 2001 this group is said to have provided $6.8 million to Palestinian charities of the $57 million collected. By 2001 it was alleged to have given Hamas $13 million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.Interpal and Development and the Al-Aqsa Charitable Foundation Fund. pp. 146, 154–159.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's funding came from states in the Persian Gulf down to the mid 2000s. Saudi Arabia supplied half of the Hamas budget of $50 million in the early 2000s,Marsh E. Burfeindt, 'Rapprochement with Iran', in Thomas A.

Saudi funding, negotiated with third parties like Egypt, remained supportive of Hamas as a Sunni group but chose to provide more assistance to the PNA, the electoral loser, when the EU responded to the outcome by suspending its monetary aid.Robert Mason, [https://books.google.com/books?idZaIcBgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 Foreign Policy in Iran and Saudi Arabia: Economics and Diplomacy in the Middle East,] I.B.Tauris, 2015 pp. 48–49 Iran in the 1980s began by providing 10% of Hamas's funding, which it increased annually until by the 1990s it supplied $30 million. It accounted for $22 million, over a quarter of Hamas's budget, by the late 2000s. According to Matthew Levitt, Iran preferred direct financing to operative groups rather than charities, requiring video proof of attacks.Levitt, pp. 172–174. Much of the Iran funding is said to be channeled through Hezbollah.\nAfter 2006 Iran's willingness to take over the burden of the shortfall created by the drying up of Saudi funding also reflected the geopolitical tensions between the two, since, though Shiite, Iran was supporting a Sunni group traditionally closely linked with the Saudi kingdom.Lawrence Rubin, [https://books.google.com/books?idTzeOAwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA104 Islam in the Balance: Ideational Threats in Arab Politics].

Sullivan, [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/128377.pdf 'Latin America: Terrorism Issues']. Congressional Research Service. 14 July 2009. p. 4.\n\nAfter 2009, sanctions on Iran made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states were transferred through the Rafah Border Crossing. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, Iran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150 million in 2012 to $60 million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the Yemeni Civil War.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA173 p.173].\n\nHistory\n\n \n\nGaza Islamic roots and establishment of Hamas\n\nHamas rose as an offshoot of the Gaza Mujama al-Islamiya branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood,Ziyād Abū ʻAmr, [https://books.google.com/books?id\njrTG5sdLHD8C&pgPA16   Islamic Fundamentalism in the West Bank and Gaza: Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic Jihad,] Indiana University Press, 1994 p.16.Rashmi Singh,  [https://books.google.com/books?idAQ_TOiLtdtAC&pg\nPA153  Hamas and Suicide Terrorism: Multi-causal and Multi-level Approaches,]  Routledge, 2013 p.153 n.70. which had been actively encouraged by Israel to expand as a counterweight to the influence of the secular Palestine Liberation Organization .Andrew Higgins, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123275572295011847 'How Israel Helped to Spawn Hamas'], The Wall Street Journal 24 January 2009.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&dq%22Mujama+al-Islamiya%22+israel+charity&source\ngbs_navlinks_s p.24 p. 24]: \"Scholars and historians on both sides...agree that from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s the [Muslim] Brotherhood benefited from the Israeli government's support of non-violent Islamist Palestinian factions, believing these groups would function as a useful counterweight to the secular nationalist Palestinian groups...\"Philip Mattar (ed.,)  [https://books.google.com/books?idGkbzYoZtaJMC&pg\nPA195  Encyclopedia of the Palestinians,] Infobase Publishing, 2005 p.195: 'the Brotherhood was even quietly assisted by Israel I authorities in the hopes that it could serve as an alternative to the PLO',Riaz Hassan, [https://books.google.com/books?idxlp_BAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA80  Life as a Weapon: The Global Rise of Suicide Bombings,] Routledge, Revised ed.2014 p.80-Amr p.31.Ahmad Yassin stated 'the PLO is secularist.

Moreover, Hamas was created essentially because the Islamicists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood feared that without their direct participation in the first Intifada, they would lose supporters to both the PIJ and the PLO, the latter of which was anxious to reassert itself in the Palestinian territories after being marginalized following its expulsion from Lebanon.

The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading \"Recognition of Israel,\" it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): \"The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter. A few months later, via University of Maryland's Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush stating they \"don't mind having a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders\", and asked for direct negotiations: \"Segal emphasized that a state within the 1967 borders and a truce for many years could be considered Hamas's de facto recognition of Israel.\"\n\nIn an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader Khaled Mashal and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a referendum. Hamas later publicly offered a long-term truce with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and grant the \"right of return\" to all Palestinian refugees.Al Jazeera, [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2008/04/2008615098393788.html \"Hamas ready to accept 1967 borders\"]. Apr 22, 2008. In November 2008, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh re-stated that Hamas was willing to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, and offered Israel a long-term truce \"if Israel recognized the Palestinians' national rights\". In 2009, in a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haniyeh repeated his group's support for a two-state settlement based on 1967 borders: \"We would never thwart efforts to create an independent Palestinian state with borders [from] June 4, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital.\" On December 1, 2010, Ismail Haniyeh again repeated, \"We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees,\" and \"Hamas will respect the results [of a referendum] regardless of whether it differs with its ideology and principles.\"\n\nIn February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence. Evidence for this was provided by an eruption of violence from Islamic Jihad in March 2012 after an Israeli assassination of a Jihad leader, during which Hamas refrained from attacking Israel. \"Israel—despite its mantra that because Hamas is sovereign in Gaza it is responsible for what goes on there—almost seems to understand,\" wrote Israeli journalists Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, \"and has not bombed Hamas offices or installations\".\n\nIsrael has rejected some truce offers by Hamas because it contends the group uses them to prepare for more fighting rather than peace.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/25/israelandthepalestinians Israel rejects Gaza ceasefire] The Guardian (UK), April 25, 2008 The Atlantic magazine columnist Jeffrey Goldberg, along with other analysts, believes Hamas may be incapable of permanent reconciliation with Israel.[http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/nizar_rayyan_of_hamas_on_gods.php \"Nizar Rayyan of Hamas on God's Hatred of Jews\"], The Atlantic, (January 2, 2009).

It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver anti-semitic messages. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust Hamas Condemns the Holocaust] The Guardian May 12, 2008 Hamas produced several propaganda songs aimed to scare Israeli citizen including Shock Israel's Security and \"Go, call a Gazan to rip Giv'ati\".\n\nChildren's magazine\n\nAl-Fateh (\"the conqueror\") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for \"the young builders of the future\".\n\nAccording to MEMRI (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as \"murderers of the prophets\" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled \"The Story of a Martyr\" presents the \"heroic deeds\" of a mujahid from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh (\"The Conqueror\")—a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar—as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.\n\nAl-Aqsa TV\n\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas. The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006., news24.com, January 22, 2006 Its programming includes ideologically tinged children's shows, news talk, and religiously inspired entertainment. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the station promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views. Al-Aqsa TV is headed by Fathi Ahmad Hammad, chairman of al-Ribat Communications and Artistic Productions—a Hamas-run company that also produces Hamas's radio station, Voice of al-Aqsa, and its biweekly newspaper, The Message.\n\nIslamization efforts\n\nIn the Gaza Strip\n\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted, while defining that role as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing. This is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change.Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?idzUjuCQAAQBAJ&pg\nPA73 pp.73–4].Phillips, [https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA81 p.81].\n\nIn 1989, during the first intifada, a small number of Hamas followersShitrit p.74. campaigned for the wearing of the hijab, which is not a part of traditional women's attire in Palestine,Gerber p.27. for polygamy, and also insisted women stay at home and be segregated from men.

The Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students. When the BBC in 2010 interviewed five \"middle-class\" women in Gaza City, the subjects generally indicated Hamas attempts to enforce conservative religious standards of dress had been largely rejected by the local population, with some expressing concern that the closure of Gaza would allow the proliferation of extremist enforcement attempts by low-level Hamas officials, and others indicating they were happy to see Hamas enforcing such requirements. They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law. One woman noted that the environment was \"not as bad\" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress. One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: \"Hamas want to force themselves onto the people. They want the people to submit to them, this is their cover. They destroyed the reputation of Islam, by saying we're doing this because it is religion. This is how they won the elections.\"\n\nIn 2013, UNRWA canceled its annual marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women from participating in the race.\n\nIn the West Bank\n\nIn 2005, the human rights organization Freemuse released a report titled \"Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music\", which said that Palestinian musicians feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.\n\nThe attempt by Hamas to dictate a cultural code of conduct in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a violent fighting between different Palestinian sectors. Hamas members reportedly burned down stores that stocked videos they deemed indecent and destroyed books they described as \"heretical\".\n\nIn 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in Qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam, or \"Haram\".\"Battling over the public sphere: Islamic reactions to the music of today\".

Yusuf described the Taliban as \"opposed to everything,\" including education and women's rights, while Hamas wants to establish good relations between the religious and secular elements of society and strives for human rights, democracy and an open society.[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?nbox-2010-06-10 Hamas: 'We want Erdoğan's model, not Taliban's'].

The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and interviews with its leaders, attempts at this differentiation have been made.Webman, Esther. Anti-semitic Motifs in the Ideology of Hizballah and Hamas, Project for the study of Anti-semitism, Tel Aviv University, 1994, p. 22.  In 2009 representatives of the small Jewish sect Neturei Karta met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, who stated that he held nothing against Jews but only against the state of Israel. Some commentators have pointed out parallels between Hamas's youth organization and Hitler Youth. According to writer Tom Doran, Hamas is not recognized as a neo-Nazi group because its members are not \"white Christians\".\n\nHamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders. Speaking of requests for Hamas to recognize agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said that \"these agreements are a reality which we view as such, and therefore I see no problem.\" Also in 2006, a Hamas official ruled out recognition of Israel with reference to West and East Germany, which never recognized each other.\n\nHamas Charter (1988)\n\n* Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to Muhammad:\n\nThe Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree (evidently a certain kind of tree), would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.\n* Article 22 states that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism:\n\nYou may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind World War I, when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate, making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it.\n\n* Article 32 of the Covenant refers to an antisemitic forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion:\n\nToday it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.\n\nStatements by Hamas members and clerics to an Arab audience\n\nIn 2008, Imam Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the Katib Wilayat mosque in Gaza that \"Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.\"\n\nAnother Hamas legislator and imam, Sheik Yunus al-Astal, discussed a Koranic verse suggesting that \"suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next.\" He concluded \"Therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.\"\n\nFollowing the rededication of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem in March 2010, senior Hamas figure al-Zahar called on Palestinians everywhere to observe five minutes of silence \"for Israel's disappearance and to identify with Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque\". He further stated that \"Wherever you have been you've been sent to your destruction. You've killed and murdered your prophets and you have always dealt in loan-sharking and destruction. You've made a deal with the devil and with destruction itself – just like your synagogue.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon that aired on Al-Aqsa TV:\n\nIf the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband's permission, and a servant without his master's permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews....

Our problem is with those occupying the land of Palestine,\" he said. \"There are Jews all over the world, but Hamas does not target them.\" In response to a statement by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas preferred non-violent means and had agreed to adopt \"peaceful resistance,\" Hamas contradicted Abbas. According to Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri, \"We had agreed to give popular resistance precedence in the West Bank, but this does not come at the expense of armed resistance.\"\n\nIn May 2009, senior Hamas MP Sayed Abu Musameh said, \"in our culture, we respect every foreigner, especially Jews and Christians, but we are against Zionists, not as nationalists but as fascists and racists.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"I hate all kinds of weapons. I dream of seeing every weapon from the atomic bomb to small guns banned everywhere.\" In January 2009, Gazan Hamas Health Minister Basim Naim published a letter in The Guardian, stating that Hamas has no quarrel with Jewish people, only with the actions of Israel. In October 1994, in a response to Isreael's crackdown on Hamas militants following a suicide bombing on a Tel Aviv bus, Hamas promised retaliation: \"Rabin must know that Hamas loves death more than Rabin and his soldiers love life.\"Israel Cracks Down on Islamic Group. Oct. 24, 1994, Pg. 1.\n The statement added that \"Hamas will not hesitate to retaliate severely against any attempt to harm our leaders.\"\n\nStatements on the Holocaust\n\nHamas has been explicit in its Holocaust denial. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on the Jewish Holocaust, held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:\nThis conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests. In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper Al-Risala that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.\n\nIn 2005, Khaled Mashal called Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's December 14, 2005 statements on the Holocaust that Europeans had \"created a myth in the name of Holocaust\"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10460807/ Iran leader's Holocaust remarks condemned] MSNBC, December 14, 2005) as \"courageous\".[http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2005/12/2008410111928749358.html \"Hamas springs to Iran's defense\"] Al Jazeera, December 15, 2005 Later in 2008, Basim Naim, the minister of health in the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in Gaza countered holocaust denial, and said \"it should be made clear that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian government in Gaza denies the Nazi Holocaust.

According to Hamas, \"Holocaust studies in refugee camps is a contemptible plot and serves the Zionist entity with a goal of creating a reality and telling stories in order to justify acts of slaughter against the Palestinian people.\" In July 2012, Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, denounced a visit by Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, to the Auschwitz death camp, saying it was \"unjustified\" and \"unhelpful\" and only served the \"Zionist occupation\" while coming \"at the expense of a real Palestinian tragedy\". He also called the Holocaust an \"alleged tragedy\" and \"exaggerated\". In October 2012, Hamas said that they were opposed to teaching about the Holocaust in Gaza Strip schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency. The Refugee Affairs Department of Hamas said that teaching the Holocaust was a \"crime against the issue of the refugees that is aimed at canceling their right of return\".\n\nViolence and terrorism\n\nHamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use \"armed resistance to end the occupation\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The al-Qassam Brigades resumed the attacks after the November 4 Israeli incursion into Gaza.[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3626260,00.html Qassam lands in western Negev, no injuries] Ynetnews November 20, 2008\n\nOn 15 June 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of involvement in the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers (including one who held American citizenship), saying \"This has severe repercussions.\" On 20 July 2014, nearly two weeks into Operation Protective Edge, Netanyahu in an interview with CNN described Hamas as \"genocidal terrorists.\"\n\nOn 5 August 2014 Israel announced that Israeli security forces arrested Hussam Kawasme, in Shuafat, in connection with the murders. During interrogation, Kawasme admitted to being the mastermind behind the attack, in addition to securing the funding from Hamas. Officials have stated that additional people arrested in connection with the murders are still being held, but no names have been released.\n\nOn 20 August, Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader in exile in Turkey, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens. He delivered an address on behalf of Khaled Mashal at the conference of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Istanbul, a move that might reflect a desire by Hamas to gain leverage.Jack Khoury, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611676 Hamas claims responsibility for three Israeli teens' kidnapping and murder,'] Haaretz 21 August 2014. In it he said: \"Our goal was to ignite an intifada in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders... Your brothers in the Al-Qassam Brigades carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike... The mujahideen captured these settlers in order to have a swap deal.\" Hamas political leader Khaled Mashal accepted that members of Hamas were responsible, stating that he knew nothing of it in advance and that what the leadership knew of the details came from reading Israeli reports.[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4562328,00.html 'Mashal: Hamas was behind murder of three Israeli teens,'] Ynet22 August 2014. Meshaal, who has headed Hamas's exiled political wing since 2004, has denied being involved in the \"details\" of Hamas \"military issues\", but \"justified the killings as a legitimate action against Israelis on \"occupied\" lands.\"\n\nHamas suicide attacks on Israeli civilians have largely disappeared since 2005; this has coincided with an increase in rocket attacks. One analysis suggests that the decline in suicide attacks is not motivated by any lack of supplies or volunteers to carry out such operations, by enhanced Israeli security measures such as the West Bank barrier (if Israeli actions were the reason, one would expect to see an equal decline in suicide attacks by all Palestinian factions, which is not observed), or by a newfound desire for reconciliation with Israel on the part of Hamas. Rather, suicide bombings provoked targeted killings that decimated the leadership of Hamas, whereas rocket attacks have elicited weaker Israeli reprisals that have tended to harm the Palestinian population as a whole more than Hamas (such as the blockade of the Gaza Strip)—thereby paradoxically increasing Hamas's popular support.\n\nRocket attacks on Israel\n\nRocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as war crimes, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, Human Rights Watch stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an \"intent to commit war crimes\". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that \"harming civilians was their aim\" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the \"accidental result\" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following Operation Cast Lead, Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, \"showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants\".[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010 In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.\n\nAccording to one report, commenting on the 2014 conflict, \"nearly all the 2,500–3,000 rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israel since the start of the war seem to have been aimed at towns\", including an attack on \"a kibbutz collective farm close to the Gaza border\", in which an Israeli child was killed. Former Israeli Lt. Col. Jonathan D. Halevi stated that \"Hamas has expressed pride in aiming long-range rockets at strategic targets in Israel including the nuclear reactor in Dimona, the chemical plants in Haifa, and Ben-Gurion Airport\", which \"could have caused thousands\" of Israeli casualties \"if successful\".\n\nIn July 2008 Barack Obama, then the Democratic presidential candidate, said: \"If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing.\"Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/washington/29diplo.html Obama Defers to Bush, for Now, on Gaza Crisis], New York Times December 28, 2009 On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement: \"the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel.\"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473167,00.html U.S. Condemns Hamas in Midst of Israeli Strikes], Fox News December 28, 2008 On March 2, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks.[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gid-B97gmhLgqf8brVLEKN46E-Lw Clinton calls for 'durable' Gaza truce, condemns rockets], AFP March 2, 2009\n\nAttempts to derail 2010 peace talks\n\nIn 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 Palestinian militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled peace talks between Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority. According to the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with Salam Fayyad, to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, \"while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress\". According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to \"get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people\". The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, \"all options are open\".[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0831/Hamas-targets-Israeli-Palestinian-talks-by-killing-four-Israelis \"Hamas targets Israeli-Palestinian talks by killing four Israelis; Hamas took responsibility for the fatal shooting of four Israeli settlers outside Hebron today, on the eve of Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington,\"] Joshua Mitnick, August 31, 2010, Christian Science Monitor. The participating groups also include Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Resistance Committees and an unnamed splinter group of Fatah.[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6811J620100902 Gaza militants vow wave of attacks against Israel], Reuters September 2, 2010\n\nAs part of the campaign, on August 31, 2010, 4 Israeli settlers, including a pregnant woman, were killed by Hamas militants while driving on Route 60 near the settlement Kiryat Arba, in the West bank. According to witnesses, militants opened fire on the moving vehicle, but then \"approached the car\" and shot the occupants in their seats at \"close range\". The attack was described by Israeli sources as one of the \"worst\" terrorist acts in years. A senior Hamas official said that Israeli settlers in the West Bank are legitimate targets since \"they are an army in every sense of the word\".\n\nThemes of martyrdom\n\nAccording to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, stated on Al-Aqsa TV, \"For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'\"[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi582&doc_id\n507 \"Hamas explains using civilians as human shields\"], Palestinian Media Watch, (December 28, 2008).\n\nIn 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the Garden of Eden, which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth \"will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom\".\n\nGuerrilla warfare\n\nHamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank. It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception. According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza.\n\nHamas has used IEDs and anti-tank rockets against the IDF in Gaza. The latter include standard RPG-7 warheads and home-made rockets such as the Al-Bana, Al-Batar and Al-Yasin. The IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas — this is due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys.\n\nExtrajudicial killings of rivals\n\nIn addition to killing Israeli civilians and armed forces, Hamas has also murdered suspected Palestinian Israel collaborators and Fatah rivals. Hundreds of Palestinians were executed by both Hamas and Fatah during the First Intifada. In the wake of the 2006 Israeli conflict with Gaza, Hamas was accused of systematically rounding up, torturing and summarily executing Fatah supporters suspected of supplying information to Israel. Human Rights Watch estimates several hundred Gazans were \"maimed\" and tortured in the aftermath of the conflict. Seventy-three Gazan men accused of \"collaborating\" had their arms and legs broken by \"unidentified perpetrators\" and 18 Palestinians accused of helping Israel were executed by Hamas security officials in the first days of the conflict. In November 2012, Hamas's Izzedine al-Qassam brigade publicly executed six Gaza residents accused of collaborating with Israel. According to the witnesses, six alleged informers were shot dead one by one in Gaza City, while the corpse of the sixth victim was tied by a cable to the back of a motorcycle and dragged through the streets. In 2013, Human Rights Watch issued a statement condemning Hamas for not investigating and giving a proper trial to the 6 men. Their statement was released the day before Hamas issued a deadline for \"collaborators\" to turn themselves in, or they will be pursued \"without mercy\". In August 2014, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, at least 22 accused collaborators were executed by Hamas shortly after three of its commanders were assassinated by Israeli forces. An Israeli source denied that any of the commanders had been targeted on the basis of human intelligence.\n\nFrequent killings of unarmed people have also occurred during Hamas-Fatah clashes. NGOs have cited a number of summary executions as particular examples of violations of the rules of warfare, including the case of Muhammad Swairki, 28, a cook for Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard, who was thrown to his death, with his hands and legs tied, from a 15-story apartment building in Gaza City. Hamas security forces reportedly shoot and torture Palestinians who opposed Hamas rule in Gaza. In one case, a Palestinian had criticized Hamas in a conversation on the street with some friends. Later that day, more than a dozen armed men with black masks and red kaffiyeh took the man from his home, and brought him to a solitary area where they shot him three times in the lower legs and ankles. The man told Human Rights Watch that he was not politically active.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, Hamas fighters stormed the Mosque of cleric Abdel-Latif Moussa. The cleric was protected by at least 100 fighters from Jund Ansar Allah (\"Army of the Helpers of God\"), an Islamist group with links to Al-Qaeda. The resulting battle left at least 13 people dead, including Moussa and 6 Hamas fighters, and 120 people injured. According to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, during 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Hamas killed more than 120 Palestinian youths for defying house arrest imposed on them by Hamas, in addition to 30–40 Palestinians killed by Hamas in extrajudicial executions after accusing them of being collaborators with Israel.\"More than 120 youths were killed by Hamas because they did not abide by the house arrest imposed on them. This is in addition to the extrajudicial execution of 30–40 people during the Israeli assault.\"http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-hints-PA-close-to-ending-unity-deal-with-Hamas-374626 Referring to the killing of suspected collaborators, a Shin Bet official stated that \"not even one\" of those executed by Hamas provided any intelligence to Israel, while the Shin Bet officially \"confirmed that those executed during Operation Protective Edge had all been held in prison in Gaza in the course of the hostilities\".\n\n2011–2013 Sinai insurgency\n\nHamas has been accused of providing weapons, training and fighters for Sinai-based insurgent attacks, although Hamas strongly denies the allegations, calling them a smear campaign aiming to harm relations with Egypt. According to the Egyptian Army, since the ouster of Egypt's Muslim-Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, over 600 Hamas members have entered the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels. In addition, several weapons used in Sinai's insurgent attacks are being traced back to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to the army. The four leading insurgent groups in the Sinai have all reportedly maintained close ties with the Gaza Strip. Hamas is also accused of helping Morsi and other high-ranking Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood members break out of the Wadi Natroun prison in Cairo during the 2011 revolution.[http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/26/205773737/egyptian-court-charges-morsi-with-conspiracy-and-murder Egypt Opens Murder, Conspiracy Investigation Against Morsi].

Egyptian authorities stated that the 2011 Alexandria bombing was carried out by the Gaza-based Army of Islam, which has received sanctuary from Hamas and earlier collaborated in the capture of Gilad Shalit. Army of Islam members linked to the August 2012 Sinai attack have reportedly sought refuge in the Gaza Strip. Egypt stated that Hamas directly provided logistical support to the Muslim Brotherhood militants who carried out the December 2013 Mansoura bombing.\n\nInternational designations as a terrorist organization\n\nHamas, together with several charities it runs,Matthew Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA143 pp.143–169]. has been designated by several governments and some academics as a terrorist organization.

In July 2017, the European Court of Justice overruled this challenge, citing that the evidence of media reports was only used for keeping Hamas on the list, rather than to add it to the list in the first place.\n\nThe European General Court found in favour of Hamas in 2014, though the verdict was appealed by the EU countries. In September 2016 a legal advisor to the European Court of Justice, Eleanor Sharpston, provided an advisory opinion, in favour of cancelling the listing of Hamas as a terrorist organization. She argued that the determination originally adopted was flawed, and that the EU cannot \"rely on facts and evidence found in press articles and information from the internet\" in order to list organizations as terrorists.[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.743661 'Hamas Should Be Taken Off Terror List, EU Legal Adviser Says ,'] Haaretz 22 September 2016.

The Jerusalem Post. Retrieved on 2010-08-21. Israel says 12,000 rockets and mortars were fired at it between 2000 and 2008—nearly 3,000 in 2008 alone. In one case, an errant Israeli mortar strike killed dozens of people near a UN school. Hamas said that the mortar killed 42 people and left dozens wounded. Israel said that Hamas militants had launched a rocket from a yard adjacent to the school and one mortar of three rounds hit the school, due to a GPS error. According to the Israeli military probe, the remaining two rounds hit the yard used to launch rockets into Israel, killing two members of Hamas's military wing who fired the rockets. Human Right Watch called Hamas to \"publicly renounce\" the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and hold those responsible to account. Human Right Watch program director Iain Levine said the attacks by Hamas were \"unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes\", and accused Hamas of putting Palestinians at risk by launching attacks from built-up areas. Hamas spokesman relied that the report was \"biased\" and he denied that Hamas uses human shields.\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated 19 incidents involving 53 civilian deaths in Gaza that Israel said were the result of Hamas fighting in densely populated areas and did not find evidence for existence of Palestinian fighters in the areas at the time of the Israeli attack.

One survey of Gazan residents addressed the subject of human shields during the 2014 war, with respondents issuing statements such as \"People received warnings from the Israelis and tried to evacuate...Hamas shot some of those people...the rest were forced to return to their homes and get bombed\"; \"Hamas imposed a curfew: anyone walking out in the street was shot without being asked any questions. That way Hamas made sure people had to stay in their homes even if they were about to get bombed\"; and \"My father received a text-message from the Israeli army warning him that our area was going to be bombed, and Hamas prevented us from leaving.\" Israeli soldiers recounted \"Suddenly, a small boy appeared, and the terrorist grabbed him and escaped with him\"; \"I saw with my own eyes someone using another person, a woman, as a shield...And I can see very clearly that the woman doesn't want to be there and he's pulling her with him\"; and \"We even found explosives in nurseries.

The Israeli government released video footage in which it claims two militants are shown grabbing a young boy's arm from behind holding him to walk in front of them toward a group of people waiting near a wall. The IDF argues the militants were placing the boy between themselves and an Israeli sniper.

Two women were later killed when Israeli forces opened fire.\n\nIn November 2006, the Israeli Air Force warned Muhammad Weil Baroud, commander of the Popular Resistance Committees who are accused of launching rockets into Israeli territory, to evacuate his home in a Jabalya refugee camp  apartment block in advance of a planned Israeli air strike. Baroud responded by calling for volunteers to protect the apartment block and nearby buildings and, according to The Jerusalem Post, hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children, responded. Israel suspended the air strike. Israel termed the action an example of Hamas using human shields.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6162494.stm Human shield deters Israel strike] BBC News November 19, 2006 In response to the incident, Hamas proclaimed: 'We won.

November 15, 2009. In a November 22 press release, Human Rights Watch condemned Hamas, stating: \"There is no excuse for calling civilians to the scene of a planned attack. Whether or not the home is a legitimate military target, knowingly asking civilians to stand in harm's way is unlawful.\"OPT: Civilians Must Not Be Used to Shield Homes Against Military Attacks Human Rights Watch November 22, 2006 Following criticism, Human rights Watch issued a statement saying that their initial assessment of the situation was in error. They stated that, on the basis of available evidence, the home demolition was in fact an administrative act, viewed in the context of Israel's longstanding policy of punitive home demolitions, not a military act and thus would not fall within the purview of the law regulating hostilities during armed conflict, which had been the basis for their initial criticism of Hamas.\n\nWhen the UN-sponsored Goldstone Commission Report on the Gaza War was commissioned in 2009, it stated that it \"found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack\" though they deemed credible reports that Palestinian militants were \"not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians\". Hamas MP Fathi Hamed stated that \"For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel...the elderly excel at this...and so do the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children.\" Following the release of the Goldstone Report, the former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan Col. Richard Kemp was invited to testify at the UN Human Rights Council 12th Special Session that during Operation Cast Lead Israel encountered an \"enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population\".Goodenough, Patrick.

The video's narration explains that Hamas indoctrinates these child combatants and that Hamas operators send the children \"on missions from which they would not risk their own lives\". According to the Israeli government, the children are used as spotters, to transport explosives and weapons, sent to play in areas to deter Israeli attacks and are sent unknowingly with explosive devices in their schoolbags to be blown up in the vicinity of Israelis.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090713221223/http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai58&ar\nHamasExploitationofCiviliansV&ak=null \"Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals\".] 2009.

In September 2007 the Hamas government banned public prayers, after Fatah supporters began holding worship sessions that quickly escalated into raucous protests against Hamas rule.

Several hours after the announcement, 17 Fatah members were released.[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/10/20081030141046326720.html Hamas frees Fatah prisoners], Al-Jazeera, October 30, 2008.\n\nOn August 2, 2012, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza. The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal \"to give in to pressure\". The IFJ said that these accusations are \"malicious\" and \"should be dropped immediately\". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work. The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop \"his officials' unwarranted interference in journalists' affairs\". In November 2012, two Gazan journalists were prevented from leaving Gaza by Hamas. There were scheduled to participate in a conference in Cairo, Egypt. After being questioned by security forces, their passports were confiscated. In 2016 Reporters Without Borders condemned Hamas for censorship and for torturing journalists. Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said \"As living conditions in the Gaza Strip are disastrous, Hamas wants to silence critics and does not hesitate to torture a journalist in order to control media coverage in its territory.\"\n\nHuman rights abuses\n\nIn June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in Ramallah published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an \"almost systematic campaign\" of human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.\n\nIn 2012, the Human Rights Watch presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of Gilad Shalit, the HRW report described it as \"cruel and inhuman\". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship. In a public statement Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, \"after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services.\" Hamas responded by denying charges and describing them as \"politically motivated\"\n\nOn May 26, 2015 Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.\n\nInternational support\n\nHamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders. Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15 million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas’s political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas, and their terror proxy Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon. Hamas was then forced out of Syria. Since then, Iran and Hezbollah have tried to mend fences with Hamas. Hamas contacted Jordan and Sudan to see if either would open up its borders to its political bureau. But both countries refused—though they welcomed many Hamas members leaving Syria. In 2012 Hamas headquarters subsequently moved to Doha, Qatar.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, under the leadership of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi, Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from Office, his replacement Abdul Fattah al-Sisi outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.\n\nQatar and Turkey\n\nAccording to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says that \"Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.\" Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. Last year on U.S. television Erdogan said, \"I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party.\"\n\nIn 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority out of the Gaza Strip. The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who pledged $250 million to repair the damage caused by the Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza. These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the \"Palestinian issue\". Qatar called Gaza's blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their \"unconditional\" support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.\n\nIn 2012, Qatar's former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400 million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas. Qatar’s reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is allegedly that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas. Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.\n\nSome began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal. They also harbor Husam Badran, former leader of Hamas's military wing in the northern West Bank. Husam Badran, current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the second intifada, including the Dolphinarium discotheque bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people. Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including Saleh al-Arouri, the senior Hamas officer, known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad. Al-Arouri is alleged to have orchestrated the June 2014 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers and to have started the 50-day war between Israel and Palestine, and now lives in Turkey.\n\nSpeaking in reference to Qatar’s support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, \"You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know.\" Some argue that Hamas’s relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem.\n\nBut Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world. In March 2015, Hamas has announced its support of the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.[http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/725241 Hamas supports military operation for political legitimacy in Yemen]. Arab News. 30 March 2015.\n\nU.S.-based support\n\nSeveral U.S. organizations were either shut down or held liable for financing Hamas in early 2001, groups that have origins from the mid-1990s: the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), and Kind Hearts. The U.S. Treasury Department specially designated the HLF in 2001 for terror ties: \"from 1995 to 2001 the HLF transferred \"approximately $12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.\" According to the Treasury Department, Khaled Meshal identified one of HLF's officers, Mohammed El-Mezain as \"the Hamas leader for the U.S.\" In 2003, IAP was found liable for financially supporting Hamas, and in 2006, Kind Hearts had their assets frozen for supporting Hamas. In 2016, it was reported that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) against Israel includes a web of Hamas supporters from the Illinois-based organization American Muslims for Palestine (AMP).",

Following the elections, the Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) made future foreign assistance to the PA conditional upon the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those changes, which led to the Quartet suspending its foreign assistance program and Israel imposing economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance.\n* [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/hamas/index.html Hamas] The New York Times, June 18, 2010 \"The pact did not succeed in restoring the flow of aid and did not last.

Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (dawah); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (al-Mujahideen al Filastinun); (c) a security service (Jehaz Aman); and (d) a media branch (A’alam).Levitt 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA11 pp.10–11]. Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (Kuwaidia) under Khaled Mashal.Levitt, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA11 pp.11–12].

On 6 May 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniya to become the new leader, to replace Mashal.\n\nThe exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities. Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. Communication between the political and military wings of Hamas is difficult, owing to the thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and the existence of an extensive base of informants. After the assassination of Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.Davis 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA44 pp.44–45].\n\nConsultative councils\n\nThe governing body is the Majlis al-Shura.

Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt.David L. Phillips,[https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA75 From Bullets to Ballots: Violent Muslim Movements in Transition,] Transaction Publishers, 2011 p.75. As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions like financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction. A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 pp.47ff].\n\nThe dawah infrastructure itself was understood, within the Palestinian context, as providing the soil from which a militant opposition to the occupation would flower.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA16 p.23]:'In a 1995 lecture, Sheikh Jamil Hamami, a party to the foundation of Hamas and a senior member of its West Bank leadership, expounded the importance of Hamas' dawa infrastructure as the soil from which militancy would flower.' In this regard it differs from the rival Palestinian Islamic Jihad which lacks any social welfare network, and relies on spectacular terrorist attacks to recruit adherents.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?idCG-AjU3rraQC&pg\nPA26 pp.25–26]. In 2007, through funding from Iran, Hamas managed to allocate at a cost of $60 million, monthly stipends of $100 for 100,000 workers, and a similar sum for 3,000 fishermen laid idle by Israel's imposition of restrictions on fishing offshore, plus grants totalling $45 million to detainees and their families.Mohsen Saleh, [https://books.google.com/books?idLGVkCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA198 The Palestinian Strategic Report 2006,] Al Manhal, 2007 p.198.

Israel holds the families of suicide bombers accountable and bulldozes their homes, whereas the families of Hamas activists who have been killed or wounded during militant operations are given an initial, one-time grant varying between $500–$5,000, together with a $100 monthly allowance. Rent assistance is also given to families whose homes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing though families unaffiliated with Hamas are said to receive less.Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?idcNq0gvBPcGQC&pg\nPA81 p.81].Levitt, pp. 122–123.\n\nUntil 2007, these activities extended to the West Bank, but, after a PLO crackdown, now continue exclusively in the Gaza Strip.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 p.48]. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état deposed the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsi in 2013, Hamas found itself in a financial straightjacket and has since endeavoured to throw the burden of responsibility for public works infrastructure in the Gaza Strip back onto the Palestinian National Authority, but without success.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA48 pp.48–49].\n\nMilitary wing\n\nThe Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing was formed in either mid-1991Aoibhín de Búrca, [https://books.google.com/books?idLCJHBQAAQBAJ&pg\nPA100 Preventing Political Violence Against Civilians: Nationalist Militant Conflict in Northern Ireland, Israel And Palestine,] Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 pp.100–102.Mohammad Najib and Roland Friedrich 'Non-Statutory Armed Groups and Security Sector Governance,' in Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold  (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id\nicV4k__xMmgC&pgPA106  Entry-points to Palestinian Security Sector Reform,] DCAF, 2007 pp.101–127 p.103.This date is based on a Hamas operation that assassinated the rabbi of the Israeli settlement of Kfar Darom inside the Gaza Strip. or 1992, under the direction of Yahya Ayyash, a Hamas field-commander and bomb-maker assassinated by Israel in 1996. It was constituted from units associated with the earlier al-Jihad wa Da’wa, an umbrella group that had gathered in militants from various Islamic resistance cells like the Al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun (Palestinian fighters).Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id\nbmaFCwAAQBAJ&pgPT110 pp.110–111]. established by Salah Shehade in 1986.Najib p.103.\n\nThe wing takes its name from the prewar militant Palestinian nationalist Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, though Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as \"Students of Ayyash\", \"Students of the Engineer\", or \"Yahya Ayyash Units\". At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions. This approach had been justified two years earlier when, in the wake of the killing of some 20 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces dispersing protestors at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1990, Hamas had declared every Israeli soldier a legitimate target.Alincée Van Engeland,'Hamas,' in Jeffrey Ian Ross (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?idMFfrBgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA319 Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present,] Routledge 2015 pp.319–323: p.319.\n\nAyyash, with a degree in electrical engineering, quickly improved Hamas's strike capacity by developing IEDs and promoting the tactic of suicide bombings.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idbmaFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPT110 p.111]. By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1, which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried.Mohannad Sabry,[https://books.google.com/books?idydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA65 Sinai: Egypt's Linchpin, Gaza's Lifeline, Israel's Nightmare], British Academic Press, 2015, p. 65. Over the next five years of the conflict, a 3-kilogram-warhead-armed version with a strike range of 6–8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also producedNajib p. 107 and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip: 4 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 155 in 2003, 281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12–14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel.Sabry p. 67. During the War with Israel in 2008–2009, Hamas deployed 122-mm Grad rocketry with a 20–40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided Kornet antitank missiles.Sabry, [https://books.google.com/books?idydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg\nPA73 p.73]. By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the Fajr-5 rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as Tel Aviv, as was shown after the assassination of Ahmed Jabari in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa.Jefferis,[https://books.google.com/books?idrzRpCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA119 p.119]. Hamas deployed its increasingly sophisticated rocketry to replace its martyrdom operations.Najib p. 107.\n\nWhile the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive military style training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War).Mathieu Guidère, [https://books.google.com/books?id\ntCvhzGiDMYsC&pgPA173  Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism,] Scarecrow Press, 2012 p.173. Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives,Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nzUjuCQAAQBAJ&pgPA71 p.71].Najib p.106. forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for two years.\n\nThe group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:\n\nTo evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.Najib p.105.\nAccording to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers, and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.Najib pp. 105–106.\n\nIn practice, Hamas altered its approach restricting actions to 'legitimate military targets' by extended them to Israeli civilians after 7 years. Though between 1996 and 2001 it generally refrained from targeting Israeli civilians,Najib p.106 it adopted sporadic suicide bombings in the wake of the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, when an Israeli settler in military fatigues, Baruch Goldstein, shot dead 29 Muslims at prayer in 1993.R.Kim Cragin,'Learning to Survive:The Case of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)', in James JF Forrest (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id\n1R79AAAAQBAJ&pgPA199 Teaching Terror: Strategic and Tactical Learning in the Terrorist World,] Rowman & Littlefield, 2006 pp.189–204 p.196.Erlich Reese, Robert Baer, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n2gZZCwAAQBAJ&pgPA26 Conversations with Terrorists: Middle East Leaders on Politics, Violence, and Empire,] Routledge, 2016 p.28.Dunning, [https://books.google.com/books?id\n4jp-CwAAQBAJ&pgPA30 p.34]. After the Al Aqsa revolt, the Brigades were behind most of the suicide bombings in Israel, a measure it defended as a form of \"reciprocity\".\n\nDown to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from Yahya Ayyash (5 January 1996), it has lost Emad Akel (24 November 1993) Salah Shehade, (23 July 2002), Ibrahim al-Makadmeh, (8 March 2003) Ismail Abu Shanab, (21 August 2003) Ahmed Yassin (March 22, 2004) and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi,( April 17, 2004).,Harry Raymond Hueston, Paul G.

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4–5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions. Unlike the political section, which is split between an internal and external structure, the Brigades are under a local Palestinian leadership, and disobedience with the decisions taken by the political leadership have been relatively rare.Najib pp.107-108-\n\nAlthough the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated.

Some cells have independent links with the external leadership, enabling them to bypass the hierarchical command chain and political leadership in Gaza.

Matthew Levitt on the other hand argues vocally for the idea that Hamas's welfare institutions act as a mere façade or front for the financing of terrorism, and dismisses the idea of two wings as a 'myth'.Julie C.Herrick,'Non-State Actors: A Comparative Analysis of Change and Development Within Hamas and Hezbollah,' in Bahgat Korany (ed.),  [https://books.google.com/books?id\nxyMjPQDzIp8C&pgPA179  The Changing Middle East: A New Look at Regional Dynamics,] American University in Cairo Press, 2010 pp.167–195, p.179. He cites Sheikh Ahmad Yassin stating in 1998: \"We can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. Hamas is one body.\"Matthew Levitt [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA34 p.34].\n\nFinances and funding\n\nAt the 1993 Philadelphia conference, Hamas leaders' statements indicated that they read George H. W. Bush's outline of a New World Order as embodying a tacit aim to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad in the occupying territories.Levitt p. 148.\n\nHamas's budget, calculated to be roughly US$70 million (2011), is derived in large part (85%) from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources. Only two Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the other contributors were donor bodies located in Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt states that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror,Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&pgPA143 pp. 143–144]. and is believed to engage in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud. Vittori states that, more than other similar organizations, it is particularly careful about keeping resources for its militant, political and public works activities separate. The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief.Colin P. Clarke, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nPJRzCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 Terrorism, Inc.: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare], ABC-CLIO, 2015 p. 97. Between 1992 and 2001 this group is said to have provided $6.8 million to Palestinian charities of the $57 million collected. By 2001 it was alleged to have given Hamas $13 million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.Interpal and Development and the Al-Aqsa Charitable Foundation Fund. pp. 146, 154–159.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's funding came from states in the Persian Gulf down to the mid 2000s. Saudi Arabia supplied half of the Hamas budget of $50 million in the early 2000s,Marsh E. Burfeindt, 'Rapprochement with Iran', in Thomas A.

It accounted for $22 million, over a quarter of Hamas's budget, by the late 2000s. According to Matthew Levitt, Iran preferred direct financing to operative groups rather than charities, requiring video proof of attacks.Levitt, pp. 172–174. Much of the Iran funding is said to be channeled through Hezbollah.\nAfter 2006 Iran's willingness to take over the burden of the shortfall created by the drying up of Saudi funding also reflected the geopolitical tensions between the two, since, though Shiite, Iran was supporting a Sunni group traditionally closely linked with the Saudi kingdom.Lawrence Rubin, [https://books.google.com/books?idTzeOAwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA104 Islam in the Balance: Ideational Threats in Arab Politics].

Congressional Research Service. 14 July 2009. p. 4.\n\nAfter 2009, sanctions on Iran made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states were transferred through the Rafah Border Crossing. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, Iran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150 million in 2012 to $60 million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the Yemeni Civil War.Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?idkGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg\nPA173 p.173].\n\nHistory\n\n \n\nGaza Islamic roots and establishment of Hamas\n\nHamas rose as an offshoot of the Gaza Mujama al-Islamiya branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood,Ziyād Abū ʻAmr, [https://books.google.com/books?id\njrTG5sdLHD8C&pgPA16   Islamic Fundamentalism in the West Bank and Gaza: Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic Jihad,] Indiana University Press, 1994 p.16.Rashmi Singh,  [https://books.google.com/books?idAQ_TOiLtdtAC&pg\nPA153  Hamas and Suicide Terrorism: Multi-causal and Multi-level Approaches,]  Routledge, 2013 p.153 n.70. which had been actively encouraged by Israel to expand as a counterweight to the influence of the secular Palestine Liberation Organization .Andrew Higgins, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123275572295011847 'How Israel Helped to Spawn Hamas'], The Wall Street Journal 24 January 2009.Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id\nCG-AjU3rraQC&dq%22Mujama+al-Islamiya%22+israel+charity&source\ngbs_navlinks_s p.24 p. 24]: \"Scholars and historians on both sides...agree that from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s the [Muslim] Brotherhood benefited from the Israeli government's support of non-violent Islamist Palestinian factions, believing these groups would function as a useful counterweight to the secular nationalist Palestinian groups...\"Philip Mattar (ed.,)  [https://books.google.com/books?idGkbzYoZtaJMC&pg\nPA195  Encyclopedia of the Palestinians,] Infobase Publishing, 2005 p.195: 'the Brotherhood was even quietly assisted by Israel I authorities in the hopes that it could serve as an alternative to the PLO',Riaz Hassan, [https://books.google.com/books?idxlp_BAAAQBAJ&pg\nPA80  Life as a Weapon: The Global Rise of Suicide Bombings,] Routledge, Revised ed.2014 p.80-Amr p.31.Ahmad Yassin stated 'the PLO is secularist.

The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading \"Recognition of Israel,\" it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): \"The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter. A few months later, via University of Maryland's Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush stating they \"don't mind having a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders\", and asked for direct negotiations: \"Segal emphasized that a state within the 1967 borders and a truce for many years could be considered Hamas's de facto recognition of Israel.\"\n\nIn an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader Khaled Mashal and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a referendum. Hamas later publicly offered a long-term truce with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and grant the \"right of return\" to all Palestinian refugees.Al Jazeera, [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2008/04/2008615098393788.html \"Hamas ready to accept 1967 borders\"]. Apr 22, 2008. In November 2008, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh re-stated that Hamas was willing to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, and offered Israel a long-term truce \"if Israel recognized the Palestinians' national rights\". In 2009, in a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haniyeh repeated his group's support for a two-state settlement based on 1967 borders: \"We would never thwart efforts to create an independent Palestinian state with borders [from] June 4, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital.\" On December 1, 2010, Ismail Haniyeh again repeated, \"We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees,\" and \"Hamas will respect the results [of a referendum] regardless of whether it differs with its ideology and principles.\"\n\nIn February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence. Evidence for this was provided by an eruption of violence from Islamic Jihad in March 2012 after an Israeli assassination of a Jihad leader, during which Hamas refrained from attacking Israel. \"Israel—despite its mantra that because Hamas is sovereign in Gaza it is responsible for what goes on there—almost seems to understand,\" wrote Israeli journalists Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, \"and has not bombed Hamas offices or installations\".\n\nIsrael has rejected some truce offers by Hamas because it contends the group uses them to prepare for more fighting rather than peace.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/25/israelandthepalestinians Israel rejects Gaza ceasefire] The Guardian (UK), April 25, 2008 The Atlantic magazine columnist Jeffrey Goldberg, along with other analysts, believes Hamas may be incapable of permanent reconciliation with Israel.[http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/nizar_rayyan_of_hamas_on_gods.php \"Nizar Rayyan of Hamas on God's Hatred of Jews\"], The Atlantic, (January 2, 2009).

Commenting on relations with Hamas, Abbas revealed in an interview with Al Jazeera that \"We agreed that the period of calm would be not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in the West Bank,\" adding that \"We also agreed on a peaceful popular resistance [against Israel], the establishment of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders and that the peace talks would continue if Israel halted settlement construction and accepted our conditions.\" Progress has stalled, until an April 2014 agreement to form a compromise unity government, with elections to be held in late 2014.\n\n2008–2009 Gaza War\n\nOn June 17, 2008, Egyptian mediators announced that an informal truce had been agreed to between Hamas and Israel. Hamas agreed to cease rocket attacks on Israel, while Israel agreed to allow limited commercial shipping across its border with Gaza, barring any breakdown of the tentative peace deal; Hamas also hinted that it would discuss the release of Gilad Shalit. Israeli sources state that Hamas also committed itself to enforce the ceasefire on the other Palestinian organizations.

Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants.

The charter no longer calls for Israel's destruction, but still calls for liberation of Palestine and to 'confront the Zionist project'. It also confirms acceptance of the 1967 borders as the basis for establishing a Palestinian state as well as not being an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn October 2017, Fatah and Hamas signed yet another reconciliation agreement. The partial agreement addresses civil and administrative matters involving Gaza and the West Bank. Other contentious issues such as national elections, reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and possible demilitarization of Hamas were to be discussed in the next meeting in November 2017, due to a new step-by-step approach.\n\nMedia\n\nIn 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, Al-Aqsa TV. The station was launched on January 7, 2006, less than three weeks before the Palestinian legislative elections. It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver anti-semitic messages. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust Hamas Condemns the Holocaust] The Guardian May 12, 2008 Hamas produced several propaganda songs aimed to scare Israeli citizen including Shock Israel's Security and \"Go, call a Gazan to rip Giv'ati\".\n\nChildren's magazine\n\nAl-Fateh (\"the conqueror\") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for \"the young builders of the future\".\n\nAccording to MEMRI (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as \"murderers of the prophets\" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled \"The Story of a Martyr\" presents the \"heroic deeds\" of a mujahid from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh (\"The Conqueror\")—a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar—as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.\n\nAl-Aqsa TV\n\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas. The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006., news24.com, January 22, 2006 Its programming includes ideologically tinged children's shows, news talk, and religiously inspired entertainment. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the station promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views. Al-Aqsa TV is headed by Fathi Ahmad Hammad, chairman of al-Ribat Communications and Artistic Productions—a Hamas-run company that also produces Hamas's radio station, Voice of al-Aqsa, and its biweekly newspaper, The Message.\n\nIslamization efforts\n\nIn the Gaza Strip\n\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted, while defining that role as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing.

The Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students. When the BBC in 2010 interviewed five \"middle-class\" women in Gaza City, the subjects generally indicated Hamas attempts to enforce conservative religious standards of dress had been largely rejected by the local population, with some expressing concern that the closure of Gaza would allow the proliferation of extremist enforcement attempts by low-level Hamas officials, and others indicating they were happy to see Hamas enforcing such requirements. They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law. One woman noted that the environment was \"not as bad\" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress. One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: \"Hamas want to force themselves onto the people. They want the people to submit to them, this is their cover. They destroyed the reputation of Islam, by saying we're doing this because it is religion. This is how they won the elections.\"\n\nIn 2013, UNRWA canceled its annual marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women from participating in the race.\n\nIn the West Bank\n\nIn 2005, the human rights organization Freemuse released a report titled \"Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music\", which said that Palestinian musicians feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.\n\nThe attempt by Hamas to dictate a cultural code of conduct in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a violent fighting between different Palestinian sectors. Hamas members reportedly burned down stores that stocked videos they deemed indecent and destroyed books they described as \"heretical\".\n\nIn 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in Qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam, or \"Haram\".\"Battling over the public sphere: Islamic reactions to the music of today\".

The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and interviews with its leaders, attempts at this differentiation have been made.Webman, Esther. Anti-semitic Motifs in the Ideology of Hizballah and Hamas, Project for the study of Anti-semitism, Tel Aviv University, 1994, p. 22.  In 2009 representatives of the small Jewish sect Neturei Karta met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, who stated that he held nothing against Jews but only against the state of Israel. Some commentators have pointed out parallels between Hamas's youth organization and Hitler Youth. According to writer Tom Doran, Hamas is not recognized as a neo-Nazi group because its members are not \"white Christians\".\n\nHamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders. Speaking of requests for Hamas to recognize agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said that \"these agreements are a reality which we view as such, and therefore I see no problem.\" Also in 2006, a Hamas official ruled out recognition of Israel with reference to West and East Germany, which never recognized each other.\n\nHamas Charter (1988)\n\n* Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to Muhammad:\n\nThe Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree (evidently a certain kind of tree), would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.\n* Article 22 states that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism:\n\nYou may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind World War I, when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate, making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it.\n\n* Article 32 of the Covenant refers to an antisemitic forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion:\n\nToday it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.\n\nStatements by Hamas members and clerics to an Arab audience\n\nIn 2008, Imam Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the Katib Wilayat mosque in Gaza that \"Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.\"\n\nAnother Hamas legislator and imam, Sheik Yunus al-Astal, discussed a Koranic verse suggesting that \"suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next.\" He concluded \"Therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.\"\n\nFollowing the rededication of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem in March 2010, senior Hamas figure al-Zahar called on Palestinians everywhere to observe five minutes of silence \"for Israel's disappearance and to identify with Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque\". He further stated that \"Wherever you have been you've been sent to your destruction. You've killed and murdered your prophets and you have always dealt in loan-sharking and destruction. You've made a deal with the devil and with destruction itself – just like your synagogue.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon that aired on Al-Aqsa TV:\n\nIf the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband's permission, and a servant without his master's permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews....

Our problem is with those occupying the land of Palestine,\" he said. \"There are Jews all over the world, but Hamas does not target them.\" In response to a statement by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas preferred non-violent means and had agreed to adopt \"peaceful resistance,\" Hamas contradicted Abbas. According to Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri, \"We had agreed to give popular resistance precedence in the West Bank, but this does not come at the expense of armed resistance.\"\n\nIn May 2009, senior Hamas MP Sayed Abu Musameh said, \"in our culture, we respect every foreigner, especially Jews and Christians, but we are against Zionists, not as nationalists but as fascists and racists.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"I hate all kinds of weapons. I dream of seeing every weapon from the atomic bomb to small guns banned everywhere.\" In January 2009, Gazan Hamas Health Minister Basim Naim published a letter in The Guardian, stating that Hamas has no quarrel with Jewish people, only with the actions of Israel. In October 1994, in a response to Isreael's crackdown on Hamas militants following a suicide bombing on a Tel Aviv bus, Hamas promised retaliation: \"Rabin must know that Hamas loves death more than Rabin and his soldiers love life.\"Israel Cracks Down on Islamic Group. Oct. 24, 1994, Pg. 1.\n The statement added that \"Hamas will not hesitate to retaliate severely against any attempt to harm our leaders.\"\n\nStatements on the Holocaust\n\nHamas has been explicit in its Holocaust denial. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on the Jewish Holocaust, held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:\nThis conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests. In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper Al-Risala that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.\n\nIn 2005, Khaled Mashal called Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's December 14, 2005 statements on the Holocaust that Europeans had \"created a myth in the name of Holocaust\"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10460807/ Iran leader's Holocaust remarks condemned] MSNBC, December 14, 2005) as \"courageous\".[http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2005/12/2008410111928749358.html \"Hamas springs to Iran's defense\"] Al Jazeera, December 15, 2005 Later in 2008, Basim Naim, the minister of health in the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in Gaza countered holocaust denial, and said \"it should be made clear that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian government in Gaza denies the Nazi Holocaust.

August 31, 2009. August 31, 2009.\n\nIn February 2011, Hamas voiced opposition to UNRWA's teaching of the Holocaust in Gaza. According to Hamas, \"Holocaust studies in refugee camps is a contemptible plot and serves the Zionist entity with a goal of creating a reality and telling stories in order to justify acts of slaughter against the Palestinian people.\" In July 2012, Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, denounced a visit by Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, to the Auschwitz death camp, saying it was \"unjustified\" and \"unhelpful\" and only served the \"Zionist occupation\" while coming \"at the expense of a real Palestinian tragedy\". He also called the Holocaust an \"alleged tragedy\" and \"exaggerated\". In October 2012, Hamas said that they were opposed to teaching about the Holocaust in Gaza Strip schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency. The Refugee Affairs Department of Hamas said that teaching the Holocaust was a \"crime against the issue of the refugees that is aimed at canceling their right of return\".\n\nViolence and terrorism\n\nHamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use \"armed resistance to end the occupation\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 through May 2008, Hamas launched more than 3,000 Qassam rockets and 2,500 mortar attacks into Israel.[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473448,00.html Israel At 'War to the Bitter End,' Strikes Key Hamas Sites] December 29, 2008, Fox News\n\nAttacks on civilians\n\nIn the first years of the First Intifada (1987–1993), Hamas violence was directed first at collaborators with Israel and at individuals it considered moral deviants, and then later at the Israeli military.Hamas in Politics, By Jeroen Gunning, pp. 128–129, search at [https://books.google.com/books?id9-WfAK7HXCYC&dq\n%22first+intifada%22+hamas+violence&source=gbs_navlinks_s Books.Google.com]; see also The Rise of Hamas, by Paul W.

The first of the suicide bombings that targeted civilians was at Afula on April 16, 1994, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden car next to a bus, killing nine (including the bomber) and wounding 50. The most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27, 2002, in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded. The attack has also been referred to as the Passover massacre since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover at a Seder.\n\nHamas has defended suicide attacks as a legitimate aspect of its asymmetric warfare against Israel. In 2003, according to Stephen Atkins, Hamas resumed suicide bombings in Israel as a retaliatory measure after the failure of peace talks and an Israeli campaign targeting members of the upper echelon of the Hamas leadership.,Stephen E.

Al-Qassam Brigades was estimated in 2007 to have launched 22% of the rocket and mortar attacks, which killed fifteen people between the years 2000 and 2009 (see Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel). The introduction of the Qassam-2 rocket in 2008 enabled Palestinian paramilitary groups to reach, from Gaza, such Israeli cities such as Ashkelon.[http://209.85.215.104/search?q\ncache:IUoG7pzhCJsJ:www.bicom.org.uk/background/research-and-analysis/bicom-analysis/bicom-fact-sheet-2--ashkelon---the-changing-scenario+Qassam+rockets+ashkelon&hlen&ct\nclnk&cd9&gl\nus&client=firefox-a BICOM Fact Sheet 2: Ashkelon – The Changing Scenario] BICOM. 2008-05-03.\n\nIn 2008, Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, offered that Hamas would attack only military targets if the IDF would stop causing the deaths of Palestinian civilians.

The al-Qassam Brigades resumed the attacks after the November 4 Israeli incursion into Gaza.[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3626260,00.html Qassam lands in western Negev, no injuries] Ynetnews November 20, 2008\n\nOn 15 June 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of involvement in the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers (including one who held American citizenship), saying \"This has severe repercussions.\" On 20 July 2014, nearly two weeks into Operation Protective Edge, Netanyahu in an interview with CNN described Hamas as \"genocidal terrorists.\"\n\nOn 5 August 2014 Israel announced that Israeli security forces arrested Hussam Kawasme, in Shuafat, in connection with the murders. During interrogation, Kawasme admitted to being the mastermind behind the attack, in addition to securing the funding from Hamas. Officials have stated that additional people arrested in connection with the murders are still being held, but no names have been released.\n\nOn 20 August, Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader in exile in Turkey, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens. He delivered an address on behalf of Khaled Mashal at the conference of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Istanbul, a move that might reflect a desire by Hamas to gain leverage.Jack Khoury, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611676 Hamas claims responsibility for three Israeli teens' kidnapping and murder,'] Haaretz 21 August 2014.

Your brothers in the Al-Qassam Brigades carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike... The mujahideen captured these settlers in order to have a swap deal.\" Hamas political leader Khaled Mashal accepted that members of Hamas were responsible, stating that he knew nothing of it in advance and that what the leadership knew of the details came from reading Israeli reports.[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4562328,00.html 'Mashal: Hamas was behind murder of three Israeli teens,'] Ynet22 August 2014. Meshaal, who has headed Hamas's exiled political wing since 2004, has denied being involved in the \"details\" of Hamas \"military issues\", but \"justified the killings as a legitimate action against Israelis on \"occupied\" lands.\"\n\nHamas suicide attacks on Israeli civilians have largely disappeared since 2005; this has coincided with an increase in rocket attacks. One analysis suggests that the decline in suicide attacks is not motivated by any lack of supplies or volunteers to carry out such operations, by enhanced Israeli security measures such as the West Bank barrier (if Israeli actions were the reason, one would expect to see an equal decline in suicide attacks by all Palestinian factions, which is not observed), or by a newfound desire for reconciliation with Israel on the part of Hamas. Rather, suicide bombings provoked targeted killings that decimated the leadership of Hamas, whereas rocket attacks have elicited weaker Israeli reprisals that have tended to harm the Palestinian population as a whole more than Hamas (such as the blockade of the Gaza Strip)—thereby paradoxically increasing Hamas's popular support.\n\nRocket attacks on Israel\n\nRocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as war crimes, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, Human Rights Watch stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an \"intent to commit war crimes\". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that \"harming civilians was their aim\" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the \"accidental result\" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following Operation Cast Lead, Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, \"showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants\".[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010 In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.\n\nAccording to one report, commenting on the 2014 conflict, \"nearly all the 2,500–3,000 rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israel since the start of the war seem to have been aimed at towns\", including an attack on \"a kibbutz collective farm close to the Gaza border\", in which an Israeli child was killed. Former Israeli Lt. Col. Jonathan D. Halevi stated that \"Hamas has expressed pride in aiming long-range rockets at strategic targets in Israel including the nuclear reactor in Dimona, the chemical plants in Haifa, and Ben-Gurion Airport\", which \"could have caused thousands\" of Israeli casualties \"if successful\".\n\nIn July 2008 Barack Obama, then the Democratic presidential candidate, said: \"If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing.\"Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/washington/29diplo.html Obama Defers to Bush, for Now, on Gaza Crisis], New York Times December 28, 2009 On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement: \"the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel.\"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473167,00.html U.S. Condemns Hamas in Midst of Israeli Strikes], Fox News December 28, 2008 On March 2, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks.[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gid-B97gmhLgqf8brVLEKN46E-Lw Clinton calls for 'durable' Gaza truce, condemns rockets], AFP March 2, 2009\n\nAttempts to derail 2010 peace talks\n\nIn 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 Palestinian militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled peace talks between Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority. According to the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with Salam Fayyad, to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, \"while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress\". According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to \"get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people\". The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, \"all options are open\".[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0831/Hamas-targets-Israeli-Palestinian-talks-by-killing-four-Israelis \"Hamas targets Israeli-Palestinian talks by killing four Israelis; Hamas took responsibility for the fatal shooting of four Israeli settlers outside Hebron today, on the eve of Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington,\"] Joshua Mitnick, August 31, 2010, Christian Science Monitor.

According to witnesses, militants opened fire on the moving vehicle, but then \"approached the car\" and shot the occupants in their seats at \"close range\". The attack was described by Israeli sources as one of the \"worst\" terrorist acts in years. A senior Hamas official said that Israeli settlers in the West Bank are legitimate targets since \"they are an army in every sense of the word\".\n\nThemes of martyrdom\n\nAccording to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, stated on Al-Aqsa TV, \"For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'\"[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi582&doc_id\n507 \"Hamas explains using civilians as human shields\"], Palestinian Media Watch, (December 28, 2008).\n\nIn 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the Garden of Eden, which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth \"will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom\".\n\nGuerrilla warfare\n\nHamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank. It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception. According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza.\n\nHamas has used IEDs and anti-tank rockets against the IDF in Gaza. The latter include standard RPG-7 warheads and home-made rockets such as the Al-Bana, Al-Batar and Al-Yasin. The IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas — this is due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys.\n\nExtrajudicial killings of rivals\n\nIn addition to killing Israeli civilians and armed forces, Hamas has also murdered suspected Palestinian Israel collaborators and Fatah rivals. Hundreds of Palestinians were executed by both Hamas and Fatah during the First Intifada. In the wake of the 2006 Israeli conflict with Gaza, Hamas was accused of systematically rounding up, torturing and summarily executing Fatah supporters suspected of supplying information to Israel. Human Rights Watch estimates several hundred Gazans were \"maimed\" and tortured in the aftermath of the conflict. Seventy-three Gazan men accused of \"collaborating\" had their arms and legs broken by \"unidentified perpetrators\" and 18 Palestinians accused of helping Israel were executed by Hamas security officials in the first days of the conflict. In November 2012, Hamas's Izzedine al-Qassam brigade publicly executed six Gaza residents accused of collaborating with Israel. According to the witnesses, six alleged informers were shot dead one by one in Gaza City, while the corpse of the sixth victim was tied by a cable to the back of a motorcycle and dragged through the streets. In 2013, Human Rights Watch issued a statement condemning Hamas for not investigating and giving a proper trial to the 6 men. Their statement was released the day before Hamas issued a deadline for \"collaborators\" to turn themselves in, or they will be pursued \"without mercy\". In August 2014, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, at least 22 accused collaborators were executed by Hamas shortly after three of its commanders were assassinated by Israeli forces. An Israeli source denied that any of the commanders had been targeted on the basis of human intelligence.\n\nFrequent killings of unarmed people have also occurred during Hamas-Fatah clashes. NGOs have cited a number of summary executions as particular examples of violations of the rules of warfare, including the case of Muhammad Swairki, 28, a cook for Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard, who was thrown to his death, with his hands and legs tied, from a 15-story apartment building in Gaza City. Hamas security forces reportedly shoot and torture Palestinians who opposed Hamas rule in Gaza. In one case, a Palestinian had criticized Hamas in a conversation on the street with some friends. Later that day, more than a dozen armed men with black masks and red kaffiyeh took the man from his home, and brought him to a solitary area where they shot him three times in the lower legs and ankles. The man told Human Rights Watch that he was not politically active.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, Hamas fighters stormed the Mosque of cleric Abdel-Latif Moussa. The cleric was protected by at least 100 fighters from Jund Ansar Allah (\"Army of the Helpers of God\"), an Islamist group with links to Al-Qaeda. The resulting battle left at least 13 people dead, including Moussa and 6 Hamas fighters, and 120 people injured. According to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, during 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Hamas killed more than 120 Palestinian youths for defying house arrest imposed on them by Hamas, in addition to 30–40 Palestinians killed by Hamas in extrajudicial executions after accusing them of being collaborators with Israel.\"More than 120 youths were killed by Hamas because they did not abide by the house arrest imposed on them. This is in addition to the extrajudicial execution of 30–40 people during the Israeli assault.\"http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-hints-PA-close-to-ending-unity-deal-with-Hamas-374626 Referring to the killing of suspected collaborators, a Shin Bet official stated that \"not even one\" of those executed by Hamas provided any intelligence to Israel, while the Shin Bet officially \"confirmed that those executed during Operation Protective Edge had all been held in prison in Gaza in the course of the hostilities\".\n\n2011–2013 Sinai insurgency\n\nHamas has been accused of providing weapons, training and fighters for Sinai-based insurgent attacks, although Hamas strongly denies the allegations, calling them a smear campaign aiming to harm relations with Egypt. According to the Egyptian Army, since the ouster of Egypt's Muslim-Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, over 600 Hamas members have entered the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels. In addition, several weapons used in Sinai's insurgent attacks are being traced back to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to the army.

The Jerusalem Post. Retrieved on 2010-08-21. Israel says 12,000 rockets and mortars were fired at it between 2000 and 2008—nearly 3,000 in 2008 alone. In one case, an errant Israeli mortar strike killed dozens of people near a UN school. Hamas said that the mortar killed 42 people and left dozens wounded. Israel said that Hamas militants had launched a rocket from a yard adjacent to the school and one mortar of three rounds hit the school, due to a GPS error. According to the Israeli military probe, the remaining two rounds hit the yard used to launch rockets into Israel, killing two members of Hamas's military wing who fired the rockets. Human Right Watch called Hamas to \"publicly renounce\" the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and hold those responsible to account. Human Right Watch program director Iain Levine said the attacks by Hamas were \"unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes\", and accused Hamas of putting Palestinians at risk by launching attacks from built-up areas. Hamas spokesman relied that the report was \"biased\" and he denied that Hamas uses human shields.\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated 19 incidents involving 53 civilian deaths in Gaza that Israel said were the result of Hamas fighting in densely populated areas and did not find evidence for existence of Palestinian fighters in the areas at the time of the Israeli attack.

One survey of Gazan residents addressed the subject of human shields during the 2014 war, with respondents issuing statements such as \"People received warnings from the Israelis and tried to evacuate...Hamas shot some of those people...the rest were forced to return to their homes and get bombed\"; \"Hamas imposed a curfew: anyone walking out in the street was shot without being asked any questions. That way Hamas made sure people had to stay in their homes even if they were about to get bombed\"; and \"My father received a text-message from the Israeli army warning him that our area was going to be bombed, and Hamas prevented us from leaving.\" Israeli soldiers recounted \"Suddenly, a small boy appeared, and the terrorist grabbed him and escaped with him\"; \"I saw with my own eyes someone using another person, a woman, as a shield...And I can see very clearly that the woman doesn't want to be there and he's pulling her with him\"; and \"We even found explosives in nurseries. The whole neighborhood was practically a terrorist base.\"\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of using children as human shields. The Israeli government released video footage in which it claims two militants are shown grabbing a young boy's arm from behind holding him to walk in front of them toward a group of people waiting near a wall. The IDF argues the militants were placing the boy between themselves and an Israeli sniper.

They stated that, on the basis of available evidence, the home demolition was in fact an administrative act, viewed in the context of Israel's longstanding policy of punitive home demolitions, not a military act and thus would not fall within the purview of the law regulating hostilities during armed conflict, which had been the basis for their initial criticism of Hamas.\n\nWhen the UN-sponsored Goldstone Commission Report on the Gaza War was commissioned in 2009, it stated that it \"found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack\" though they deemed credible reports that Palestinian militants were \"not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians\".

The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal \"to give in to pressure\". The IFJ said that these accusations are \"malicious\" and \"should be dropped immediately\". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work. The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop \"his officials' unwarranted interference in journalists' affairs\". In November 2012, two Gazan journalists were prevented from leaving Gaza by Hamas. There were scheduled to participate in a conference in Cairo, Egypt. After being questioned by security forces, their passports were confiscated. In 2016 Reporters Without Borders condemned Hamas for censorship and for torturing journalists. Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said \"As living conditions in the Gaza Strip are disastrous, Hamas wants to silence critics and does not hesitate to torture a journalist in order to control media coverage in its territory.\"\n\nHuman rights abuses\n\nIn June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in Ramallah published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an \"almost systematic campaign\" of human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.\n\nIn 2012, the Human Rights Watch presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of Gilad Shalit, the HRW report described it as \"cruel and inhuman\". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship. In a public statement Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, \"after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services.\" Hamas responded by denying charges and describing them as \"politically motivated\"\n\nOn May 26, 2015 Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.\n\nInternational support\n\nHamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders. Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15 million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas’s political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas, and their terror proxy Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon. Hamas was then forced out of Syria. Since then, Iran and Hezbollah have tried to mend fences with Hamas. Hamas contacted Jordan and Sudan to see if either would open up its borders to its political bureau. But both countries refused—though they welcomed many Hamas members leaving Syria. In 2012 Hamas headquarters subsequently moved to Doha, Qatar.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, under the leadership of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi, Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from Office, his replacement Abdul Fattah al-Sisi outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.\n\nQatar and Turkey\n\nAccording to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says that \"Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.\" Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. Last year on U.S. television Erdogan said, \"I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party.\"\n\nIn 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority out of the Gaza Strip. The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who pledged $250 million to repair the damage caused by the Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza. These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the \"Palestinian issue\". Qatar called Gaza's blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their \"unconditional\" support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.\n\nIn 2012, Qatar's former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400 million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas. Qatar’s reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is allegedly that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas. Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.\n\nSome began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal. They also harbor Husam Badran, former leader of Hamas's military wing in the northern West Bank. Husam Badran, current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the second intifada, including the Dolphinarium discotheque bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people. Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including Saleh al-Arouri, the senior Hamas officer, known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad. Al-Arouri is alleged to have orchestrated the June 2014 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers and to have started the 50-day war between Israel and Palestine, and now lives in Turkey.\n\nSpeaking in reference to Qatar’s support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, \"You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know.\" Some argue that Hamas’s relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem.\n\nBut Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world.
